# Civet of Venison

## Description
Civet of Venison is a rich and flavorful dish made with venison cutlets cooked in a thick, savory sauce. The meat is broiled to perfection and then simmered in a sauce made with butter, flour, sugar, and claret wine. The result is a tender and succulent dish that is perfect for special occasions or a fancy dinner.

## Ingredients:
- 1 pound venison loin or neck, cut into cutlets
- 225 grams butter
- 110 grams flour
- 225 grams sugar
- 300 ml claret wine (or any dry red wine)

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the broiler in your oven.
2. Place the venison cutlets on a broiler pan and broil them until they are cooked to your desired level of doneness. This will depend on the thickness of the cutlets and your personal preference. It usually takes about 4-6 minutes per side for medium-rare.
3. While the venison is broiling, prepare the sauce. In a saucepan, melt the butter over medium heat until it starts to brown.
4. Gradually add the flour to the butter, stirring constantly to create a roux. Cook the roux for a few minutes until it turns a golden brown color, being careful not to burn it.
5. Add the sugar to the roux and stir until it is well combined.
6. Slowly pour in the claret wine, stirring continuously to prevent lumps from forming. Keep stirring until the sauce thickens and reaches the consistency of a ragout.
7. Once the sauce is ready, add the broiled venison cutlets to the saucepan. Toss them gently in the sauce to coat them evenly.
8. Simmer the venison in the sauce for about 5 minutes, allowing the flavors to meld together.
9. Serve the Civet of Venison hot, garnished with lemon slices if desired.
