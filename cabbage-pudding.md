# Cabbage Pudding

## Description
Cabbage Pudding is a traditional dish made with a mixture of veal, suet, cabbage, eggs, and spices. It is similar to a savory pudding and has a rich and hearty flavor.

## Options and commentary
- You can substitute the veal with ground beef or pork for a different flavor.
- If you prefer a vegetarian version, you can omit the meat and increase the amount of cabbage or add other vegetables like mushrooms or carrots.
- Feel free to adjust the amount of spices according to your taste preferences.

## Ingredients:
- 500g ground veal (or beef/pork)
- 500g suet (or vegetable shortening for a vegetarian version)
