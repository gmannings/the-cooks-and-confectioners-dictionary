# Flummery

## Description
Flummery is a traditional English dessert made from oatmeal. It has a smooth and creamy texture, similar to a pudding. This recipe requires soaking the oatmeal overnight and then boiling it with water, sugar, and orange-flower water.

## Ingredients:
- 250g fine oatmeal
- 4 liters water
- 2 tablespoons orange-flower water
- Sugar, to taste

## Instructions:
1. In a large bowl, combine the oatmeal and 2 liters of water. Let it steep for 24 hours.
2. After 24 hours, pour off the water and add 2 liters of fresh water to the oatmeal. Strain the mixture to remove any lumps.
3. Transfer the strained oatmeal mixture to a large pot and place it over medium heat.
4. Add the orange-flower water and sugar to the pot, adjusting the amount of sugar to your taste.
5. Stir the mixture continuously as it comes to a boil. Keep stirring until the mixture thickens to the consistency of hasty pudding.
6. Once the flummery has thickened, remove it from the heat.
7. Pour the flummery into shallow dishes or individual serving bowls.
8. Allow the flummery to cool completely, then refrigerate for at least 2 hours before serving.
