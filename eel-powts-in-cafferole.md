# Eel Powts in Cafferole

## Description
Eel Powts in Cafferole is a dish made with eel powts (small eels), cooked in a flavorful sauce. The eel powts are first fried in burnt butter, then simmered in a sauce made with flour, white wine, salt, pepper, nutmeg, sweet herbs, and lemon. The dish is garnished with a ragoo made from the same sauce, along with the eel livers and mushrooms. The final touch is a squeeze of lemon juice.
