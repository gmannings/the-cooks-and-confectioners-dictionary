# Stewed Pike

## Description
Stewed Pike is a classic dish from the 18th century. It involves cooking a whole pike fish in a flavorful broth made with white wine, verjuice, onions, lemons, and various spices. The fish is seasoned with salt, pepper, cloves, and herbs before being wrapped in a napkin and stewed in the broth. It is then served garnished with parsley.

## Ingredients:
- 1 whole pike fish (approximately 1-1.5 kg)
- Salt
- Pepper
- Cloves
- Fresh herbs (such as parsley, thyme, and rosemary)
- 1 onion, sliced
- 1 bay leaf
- 50g butter
- 250ml white wine
- 250ml verjuice (or substitute with apple cider vinegar)
- 2 lemons, sliced
- Nutmeg (freshly grated or ground)
- Parsley, for garnish

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 180Â°C.
2. Clean the pike fish thoroughly, removing the scales and gutting it. Rinse it under cold water and pat dry with paper towels.
3. Season the fish generously with salt, pepper, and cloves. Sprinkle some chopped fresh herbs over the fish, including the cavity.
4. Place a lump of butter inside the belly of the fish.
5. Wrap the seasoned fish tightly in a clean napkin, making sure it is well-covered.
6. In a large stew-pan, combine the white wine, verjuice, sliced onions, sliced lemons, bay leaf, a pinch of salt, a pinch of pepper, a pinch of grated nutmeg, and a pinch of cloves.
7. Bring the broth to a boil over medium heat and let it simmer for a few minutes to infuse the flavors.
8. Carefully place the wrapped pike fish into the simmering broth.
9. Cover the stew-pan with a lid and transfer it to the preheated oven.
10. Bake the fish for approximately 30-40 minutes, or until it is cooked through and flakes easily with a fork.
11. Once the fish is cooked, remove it from the oven and carefully unwrap the napkin.
12. Transfer the fish to a serving platter, garnish with fresh parsley, and serve immediately.
