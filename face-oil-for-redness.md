# Face Oil for Redness

## Description
This recipe is for a face oil that can help reduce redness on the skin. It uses gourd seed and peach kernels to create an oil that can be applied to the face twice a day.

## Ingredients:
- 113 grams gourd seeds
- 227 grams peach kernels
- Carrier oil (such as almond oil or jojoba oil)

## Instructions:
1. Grind the gourd seeds and peach kernels separately until they form a fine powder.
2. In a small saucepan, combine the powdered gourd seeds and peach kernels.
3. Add enough carrier oil to cover the powders completely.
4. Place the saucepan over low heat and gently warm the mixture for about 1 hour, stirring occasionally. This will help infuse the oil with the beneficial properties of the gourd seeds and peach kernels.
5. After 1 hour, remove the saucepan from heat and let the mixture cool.
6. Once cooled, strain the oil through a fine-mesh sieve or cheesecloth to remove any solid particles.
7. Transfer the strained oil into a clean, airtight container for storage.
8. To use, wash your face with a gentle cleanser and pat dry.
9. Take a small amount of the face oil and gently massage it onto your face, focusing on areas with redness.
10. Use the face oil in the morning and evening for best results.
