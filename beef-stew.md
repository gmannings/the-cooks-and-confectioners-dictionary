# Beef Stew

## Description
This recipe is a modernized version of an 18th-century beef stew. It is a hearty and comforting dish made with tender beef, vegetables, and flavorful broth.

## Options and commentary
- You can use any type of beef suitable for stewing, such as chuck roast or stewing beef.
- Feel free to add other vegetables like mushrooms or parsnips for additional flavor and texture.
- Serve the stew with crusty bread or over mashed potatoes for a complete meal.

## Ingredients:
- 1.5 kg beef chuck roast, cut into 2-inch cubes
- 2 tablespoons vegetable oil
- 2 onions, chopped
- 4 carrots, peeled and sliced
- 4 celery stalks, sliced
- 4 cloves of garlic, minced
- 2 tablespoons tomato paste
- 4 cups beef broth
- 2 cups red wine
- 2 bay leaves
- 1 teaspoon dried thyme
- Salt and pepper to taste

## Instructions:
1. In a large pot or Dutch oven, heat the vegetable oil over medium-high heat.
2. Add the beef cubes in batches and brown them on all sides. Remove the browned beef from the pot and set aside.
3. In the same pot, add the chopped onions, carrots, celery, and minced garlic. Cook until the vegetables are softened, about 5 minutes.
4. Stir in the tomato paste and cook for another minute.
5. Return the browned beef to the pot and pour in the beef broth and red wine. Add the bay leaves and dried thyme. Season with salt and pepper to taste.
6. Bring the stew to a boil, then reduce the heat to low. Cover the pot and simmer for 2-3 hours, or until the beef is tender.
7. Remove the bay leaves and adjust the seasoning if needed.
8. Serve the beef stew hot, garnished with fresh parsley if desired.
