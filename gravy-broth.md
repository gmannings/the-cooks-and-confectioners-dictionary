# Gravy Broth

## Description
Gravy Broth is a flavorful and comforting dish made from roasted beef and mixed with spices and citrus flavors. It can be served with sippets (small pieces of toasted bread) or poached eggs for added texture and richness.

## Options and commentary
- Instead of beef, you can use lean cuts of pork or chicken for a different flavor profile.
- If you prefer a vegetarian version, you can substitute the meat with vegetable broth and add extra spices and herbs for flavor.
- Feel free to adjust the spices and seasoning according to your taste preferences.

## Ingredients:
- 500g lean beef (or other meat of your choice)
- 1 cup Claret wine (or any dry red wine)
- Salt to taste
- Whole spices (such as cloves, peppercorns, and bay leaves)
- Peel of 1 lemon
- Sippets (small pieces of toasted bread) or poached eggs
- Oranges and lemons for garnish

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 180Â°C.
2. Place the beef on a roasting rack in a roasting pan and roast it for about 20 minutes or until it starts to brown.
3. Using a knife, gently pierce the beef to release the juices and let the gravy run out. Collect the gravy in a bowl.
4. Mix the collected gravy with the Claret wine.
5. Return the beef to the oven and continue roasting, basting it with the gravy mixture every 10 minutes. Repeat this process until all the gravy has been released from the beef and the meat is cooked to your desired level of doneness. This may take about 1 hour in total.
6. Remove the beef from the oven and let it rest for a few minutes.
7. While the beef is resting, strain the gravy mixture to remove any solids.
8. Transfer the strained gravy to a saucepan and place it over low heat.
9. Add salt, whole spices, and lemon peel to the saucepan. Simmer the gravy for about 15 minutes to allow the flavors to meld together.
10. Toast the bread slices to make sippets or poach eggs if preferred.
11. Place the sippets or poached eggs in a serving dish.
12. Pour the simmered gravy over the sippets or poached eggs.
13. Garnish the dish with slices of oranges and lemons.
14. Serve the Gravy Broth hot.
