# Potage a Sante

## Description
Potage a Sante is a traditional 18th-century French soup made with a flavorful broth and garnished with a variety of herbs. It is a hearty and nourishing dish that can be served as a main course.

## Options and commentary
- You can use a combination of beef, veal, and mutton to make the broth, or you can use store-bought beef broth as a shortcut.
- Capons or fat pullets can be added to the broth for extra flavor, but they are optional.
- The herbs used in this recipe include sorrel, purslane, and chervil, but you can use any combination of fresh herbs that you prefer.
- You can choose to garnish the soup with the chopped herbs or strain them out for a smoother texture.

## Ingredients:
- 1 liter beef broth (or homemade broth made from buttock of beef, knuckle of veal, and mutton)
- 1 capon or fat pullet (optional)
- 1 cup sorrel, chopped
- 1 cup purslane, chopped
- 1 cup chervil, chopped
- Salt and pepper to taste

## Instructions:
1. In a large pot, bring the beef broth to a simmer. If using homemade broth, add the buttock of beef, knuckle of veal, and mutton to the pot and simmer for 2-3 hours until the meat is tender and the broth is flavorful. Remove the meat from the broth and set aside.
2. If using a capon or fat pullet, add it to the pot with the broth and simmer until cooked through. Remove the poultry from the pot and set aside.
3. While the broth is simmering, prepare the herbs by washing and chopping them finely.
4. In a separate pot, bring water to a boil and blanch the chopped herbs for 1-2 minutes. Drain and set aside.
5. Once the broth is ready, season it with salt and pepper to taste.
6. To serve the soup, you have two options:
   - Option 1: Garnish the soup with the chopped herbs. Ladle the hot broth into bowls and sprinkle a generous amount of the chopped herbs on top. Serve with the cooked capon or fat pullet on the side.
   - Option 2: Strain the herbs from the broth. Use a fine-mesh strainer to remove the herbs from the broth, leaving only the clear broth and any meat or poultry. Return the strained broth to the pot and heat it gently. Serve the strained broth in bowls, garnished with the cooked capon or fat pullet if desired.
7. Serve the Potage a Sante hot and enjoy!
