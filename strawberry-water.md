# Strawberry-Water

## Description
Strawberry-Water is a refreshing and fruity drink made with fresh strawberries, water, and sugar. It is a perfect beverage for hot summer days or as a refreshing treat any time of the year.

## Ingredients:
- 500g fresh strawberries
- 1 liter water
- 100g sugar

## Instructions:
1. Pick and bruise the strawberries to release their juices.
2. In a large pitcher or bowl, combine the bruised strawberries, water, and sugar. Adjust the amount of sugar according to your taste preference.
3. Stir the mixture well to dissolve the sugar.
4. Cover the pitcher or bowl and let the mixture sit for at least 1 hour to allow the flavors to infuse.
5. After the resting period, strain the mixture to remove any solids. You can use a fine-mesh strainer, cheesecloth, or a clean napkin folded three or four times.
6. Squeeze the solids strongly to extract as much juice as possible, giving the water a vibrant red color.
7. Once strained, transfer the strawberry-water to a clean pitcher or bottle.
8. Chill the strawberry-water in the refrigerator for at least 2 hours before serving.
9. Serve the chilled strawberry-water over ice and garnish with fresh strawberries, if desired.
