# Preserved Currants in Bunches

## Description
This recipe is for preserving currants in sugar syrup and drying them in bunches. The preserved currants can be used as a sweet and tangy addition to baked goods, desserts, or enjoyed on their own as a snack.

## Ingredients:
- 500g currants
- 500g sugar

## Instructions:
1. In a large saucepan, bring the sugar and enough water to cover the currants to a boil. Continue boiling until the sugar reaches the fourth degree of boiling, also known as "feathered" stage. This is when the sugar syrup forms thin threads when dropped from a spoon.
2. Tie the currants into small bunches using kitchen twine.
3. Carefully place the currant bunches into the boiling sugar syrup, making sure they are fully submerged. Allow them to cook in the syrup for a few minutes.
4. Skim off any foam that forms on the surface of the syrup.
5. Remove the currant bunches from the syrup and place them in a preserving pan or a shallow baking dish.
6. Allow the currant bunches to drain overnight.
7. The next day, sprinkle the currant bunches with sugar to coat them evenly.
8. Place the currant bunches in a warm, dry place such as a stove or a dehydrator to dry. This process may take several days, depending on the humidity and temperature.
9. Once the currant bunches are completely dry, they can be stored in an airtight container for future use.

## Cooking time
- Boiling the sugar syrup: approximately 10-15 minutes
- Draining and drying the currant bunches: 1-3 days
