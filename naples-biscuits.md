# Naples Biscuits

## Description
Naples Biscuits are a type of sweet biscuit that originated in Naples, Italy. They are made with a combination of flour, sugar, eggs, rosewater, and caraway seeds. The biscuits are baked until golden and then glazed with a sugar-water mixture.

## Ingredients:
- 675 grams of fine flour
- 675 grams of double-refined sugar
- 12 eggs
- 3 tablespoons of rosewater
- 40 grams of caraway seeds, finely powdered
- Water for mixing
- Additional sugar for glazing

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F).
2. In a large mixing bowl, combine the fine flour and double-refined sugar.
3. Add the eggs, rosewater, and powdered caraway seeds to the bowl.
4. Mix all the ingredients together, adding enough water to form a dough. The dough should be soft and pliable.
5. Divide the dough into equal portions and shape them into round discs.
6. Place the dough discs onto greased or lined baking sheets.
7. Bake the biscuits in the preheated oven for about 15-20 minutes, or until they are golden brown.
8. While the biscuits are baking, dissolve some additional sugar in water to make a glaze.
9. Once the biscuits are baked, remove them from the oven and immediately brush the glaze over the tops of the biscuits.
