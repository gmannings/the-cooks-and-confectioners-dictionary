## Instructions:
1. In a large pot, bring water to a boil. Add the sheep's tongues and blanch them for a few minutes. Drain the tongues and rinse them with cold water.
2. In a saucepan, layer the sliced beef and bacon on the bottom. Place the pan over medium heat, cover it, and let the meat stew.
3. When the meat starts to stick to the pan, add the flour and stir it together for a few minutes.
4. Pour in the broth and water in equal quantities, enough to cover the tongues. 
5. Transfer the blanched tongues to a stewpan and pour the stewing liquid over them.
6. Season the stew with salt, pepper, assorted spices, onions, chives, parsley, carrots, parsnips, and lemon peel.
7. Let the stew simmer on low heat until the tongues are tender and cooked through. This may take about 2-3 hours, depending on the size and tenderness of the tongues.
8. Once the tongues are cooked, remove them from the stew and peel off the outer skin. Cut the tongues in half lengthwise.
9. Dip the tongues in some of the fat from the stewing liquid and dredge them with grated bread.
10. Preheat the broiler. Place the breaded tongues on a broiling pan and broil them until they are golden brown and crispy on the outside.
11. If making the haché sauce, heat some lard in a pan and add the chopped gammon of bacon, onions, parsley, mushrooms, and truffles. Cook them together until they are tender.
12. Moisten the mixture with good gravy and thicken it with a cullis of veal and gammon of bacon.
13. If using the simple seasoning, drizzle the tongues with verjuice and sprinkle them with salt and pepper.
14. Optionally, for serving, place some essence of ham in the bottom of the serving dish and arrange the tongues around it.
15. Serve the broiled sheep's tongues with the haché sauce or the simple seasoning.

## Cooking time
Approximately 2-3 hours, depending on the size and tenderness of the sheep's tongues.
