# Bread Pudding

## Description
Bread pudding is a classic dessert made with stale bread soaked in a custard mixture and baked until golden and set. It is a comforting and delicious dessert that can be served warm or cold.

## Options and commentary
- You can use any type of bread for this recipe, but it is best to use stale bread as it will absorb the custard mixture better.
- You can add raisins, dried fruits, or nuts to the bread pudding for added flavor and texture.
- Instead of boiling the pudding, you can bake it in the oven for a more traditional approach.
- Serve the bread pudding with a drizzle of caramel sauce, whipped cream, or vanilla ice cream for a decadent treat.

## Ingredients:
- 2 liters of cream
- Pinch of salt
- 200 grams of sugar
- 1/2 teaspoon of ground nutmeg
- 1/2 teaspoon of ground cinnamon
- 1/4 teaspoon of ground cloves
- 1/4 teaspoon of ground mace
- 4 French rolls, crusts removed and sliced
- 12 eggs
- Butter, for greasing the dish
- Drawn butter, for serving

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 180Â°C.
2. In a large saucepan, heat the cream over medium heat. Add the salt, sugar, nutmeg, cinnamon, cloves, and mace. Stir until the sugar has dissolved and the mixture is hot but not boiling.
3. Remove the saucepan from the heat and add the sliced French rolls. Let it sit until the bread has soaked up the cream mixture and cooled down.
4. Once the bread has cooled, drain off any excess cream that the bread has not soaked up.
5. Push the bread mixture through a colander to break it up and create a smoother texture.
6. In a separate bowl, beat the eggs together, leaving out four of the egg whites.
7. Add the beaten eggs to the bread mixture and stir well to combine.
8. Grease a baking dish with butter and pour the bread mixture into the dish.
9. Cover the dish with a cloth and tie it securely.
10. Place the dish in a large pot filled with boiling water, making sure the water comes about halfway up the sides of the dish.
11. Cover the pot and let the pudding steam for about 1 hour or until set. Check the water level occasionally and add more boiling water if needed.
12. Once the pudding is cooked, carefully remove it from the pot and let it cool slightly.
13. Serve the bread pudding warm with drawn butter on the side.
