# Barley Cream

## Description
Barley Cream is a creamy and comforting dessert made from cooked barley, almond milk, rosewater, and sugar. It has a smooth and velvety texture with a subtle floral flavor.

## Ingredients:
- 250g pearl barley
- 3 liters water
- 500ml almond milk
- 6 tablespoons rosewater
- Sugar, to taste

## Instructions:
1. In a large pot, bring the water to a boil.
2. Add the pearl barley to the boiling water and cook until tender, about 30-40 minutes.
3. Drain the cooked barley and transfer it to a mortar.
4. Use a pestle to pound the barley into a smooth paste.
5. Place a cheesecloth or thin flannel over a bowl and strain the barley paste through it, using the end of a ladle to rub it through.
6. Discard any solids left in the cheesecloth.
7. In a separate pot, heat the almond milk over medium heat until warm.
8. Add the strained barley paste to the warm almond milk and stir well to combine.
9. Stir in the rosewater and sweeten with sugar to your taste.
10. Continue to cook the mixture over low heat, stirring constantly, until it thickens to a creamy consistency, about 10-15 minutes.
