# Almond Cream Pudding

## Description
This recipe is for a rich and creamy almond pudding, flavored with orange flower water and garnished with candied citron. It is a delightful dessert that can be enjoyed on its own or served with a dollop of whipped cream.

## Options and commentary
- You can substitute almond extract for orange flower water if desired.
- Instead of Naples Biskets, you can use ladyfingers or sponge cake.
- If you don't have access to candid citron, you can use other candied fruits or simply omit the garnish.

## Ingredients:
- 225g blanched almonds
- 1 tablespoon orange flower water
- 500ml thick cream
- 2 large ladyfingers, grated
- 5 egg yolks
- 225g fine sugar
- Prepared pastry for garnish
- Candied citron for garnish

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F).
2. In a food processor or blender, grind the blanched almonds until they are very fine.
3. Transfer the ground almonds to a mixing bowl and add the orange flower water. Mix well to combine.
4. In a separate bowl, whisk the thick cream until it becomes slightly thickened.
5. Add the grated ladyfingers, egg yolks, and fine sugar to the almond mixture. Mix well to combine.
6. Gently fold in the whipped cream until all the ingredients are fully incorporated.
7. Prepare a baking dish by lining it with the prepared pastry.
8. Pour the almond cream mixture into the prepared baking dish.
9. Using a knife, create a diamond pattern on the top of the pudding by making diagonal cuts and then crossing them with additional cuts in the opposite direction.
10. Place the baking dish in the preheated oven and bake for approximately 45-50 minutes, or until the pudding is set and golden brown on top.
11. Remove the pudding from the oven and let it cool completely.
12. Once cooled, garnish the top of the pudding with strips of candied citron, arranging them within the diamond pattern.
13. Serve the almond cream pudding chilled or at room temperature.
