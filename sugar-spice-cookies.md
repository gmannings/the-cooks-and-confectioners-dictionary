# Sugar Spice Cookies

## Description
These sugar spice cookies are a delicious treat with a hint of warm spices. They are made with a combination of powdered sugar, flour, butter, and a blend of nutmeg, cloves, and mace. The dough is mixed with thick cream to create a smooth and pliable dough, which is then rolled out and baked until golden brown.

## Ingredients:
- 450g powdered sugar
- 450g all-purpose flour
- 450g unsalted butter, softened
- 1 teaspoon ground nutmeg
- 1 teaspoon ground cloves
- 1 teaspoon ground mace
- 120ml thick cream

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F) and line baking sheets with parchment paper.
2. In a large mixing bowl, combine the powdered sugar, flour, nutmeg, cloves, and mace. Mix well to evenly distribute the spices.
3. Add the softened butter to the dry ingredients. Use your hands or a pastry cutter to cut the butter into the mixture until it resembles coarse crumbs.
4. Gradually add the thick cream to the mixture, a little at a time, and mix until a smooth dough forms. You may not need to use all of the cream, so add it gradually until the dough comes together.
5. Divide the dough into two equal portions. On a lightly floured surface, roll out one portion of the dough to a thickness of about 1/4 inch.
6. Use cookie cutters to cut out desired shapes from the rolled-out dough. Place the cookies onto the prepared baking sheets, leaving some space between each cookie.
7. Repeat the rolling and cutting process with the remaining portion of dough.
8. Prick each cookie with a fork to prevent them from puffing up during baking.
9. Bake the cookies in the preheated oven for about 10-12 minutes, or until they are golden brown around the edges.
10. Remove the cookies from the oven and allow them to cool on the baking sheets for a few minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely.
11. Once the cookies are completely cooled, store them in an airtight container to maintain their freshness.
