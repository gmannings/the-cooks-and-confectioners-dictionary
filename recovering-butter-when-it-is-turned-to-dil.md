# Recovering Butter when it is Turned to Dil

## Description
This recipe provides a method for recovering butter that has become diluted or separated. By combining strong broth with butter, you can restore its texture and consistency.

## Ingredients:
- 1 ladle-full of strong broth
- 1/2 pound of butter

## Instructions:
1. In a small pot or pipkin, pour in the ladle-full of strong broth.
2. Break the half pound of butter into the pot with the broth.
3. Heat the pot over low heat, stirring constantly.
4. As the butter melts, continue stirring until it becomes white and creamy.
5. Slowly pour the oily butter into the pot, stirring it in gently.
6. Be careful not to add too much oily butter, as it may overpower the other butter.
7. Stir the mixture until the butter is fully incorporated and the texture is smooth.
8. Remove from heat and let it cool slightly before using or storing.

## Cooking time
Approximately 10 minutes
