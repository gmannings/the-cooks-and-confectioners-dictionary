# Sack-Pollet

## Description
Sack-Pollet is a creamy and rich custard dessert made with eggs, sugar, milk, and nutmeg. It is a classic 18th-century recipe that has a smooth and velvety texture.

## Options and commentary
- You can use any type of fortified wine, such as sherry or Madeira, as a substitute for Canary wine.
- If you prefer a stronger flavor, you can add a splash of brandy or rum to the custard mixture.
- Adjust the amount of sugar according to your taste preference.

## Ingredients:
- 15 eggs
- 175g white sugar
- 500ml Canary wine (or any fortified wine)
- A pinch of nutmeg
- 1 liter milk

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 180Â°C.
2. Separate the egg whites and yolks into two separate bowls.
3. Beat the egg yolks until well combined and strain them to remove any lumps.
4. In a saucepan, combine the sugar and Canary wine. Heat over low heat, stirring constantly, until the sugar has dissolved completely.
5. Slowly pour the hot wine mixture into the beaten egg yolks while continuously stirring. Hold your hand high to create a steady stream and ensure the mixture is well incorporated.
6. In a separate saucepan, heat the milk with the nutmeg until it comes to a boil.
7. Slowly pour the hot milk into the egg and wine mixture while continuously stirring.
8. Place the mixture over a low heat and cook, stirring constantly, until it thickens and coats the back of a spoon. Be careful not to let it boil.
9. Remove the saucepan from the heat and strain the custard through a fine-mesh sieve to remove any lumps.
10. Pour the custard into individual ramekins or a large baking dish.
11. Place the ramekins or baking dish in a larger baking pan filled with hot water, creating a water bath.
12. Carefully transfer the baking pan to the preheated oven and bake for about 30 minutes, or until the custard is set but still slightly jiggly in the center.
13. Remove the custard from the oven and let it cool to room temperature.
14. Once cooled, refrigerate the custard for at least 2 hours, or until chilled and set.
15. Serve the Sack-Pollet chilled, either in the ramekins or unmolded onto serving plates.
16. Optionally, garnish with a sprinkle of nutmeg or a dollop of whipped cream.
