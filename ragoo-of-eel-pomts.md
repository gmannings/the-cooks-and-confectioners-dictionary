# Ragoo of Eel-Pomts

## Description
A ragoo of eel-pomts is a dish made with eel fillets that are floured and fried, then cooked in a sauce made with burnt butter, flour, anchovies, salt, cives, nutmeg, and verjuice. The eel is stewed until tender and served garnished with fried parsley.

## Ingredients:
- 500g eel fillets
- Flour, for coating
- 50g butter
- 1 tablespoon flour
- 2 anchovy fillets, dissolved in a little water
- Salt, to taste
- 1 tablespoon chopped chives
- 1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg
- 2 tablespoons verjuice (or substitute with white wine vinegar)
- Fresh parsley, for garnish

## Instructions:
1. Clean the eel fillets by rinsing them well under hot water to remove any slime. Pat them dry with paper towels.
2. Coat the eel fillets in flour, shaking off any excess.
3. Heat the butter in a frying pan over medium heat. Fry the eel fillets until golden brown on both sides. Remove the eel fillets from the pan and set aside.
4. In the same pan, add the flour and cook for a minute to make a roux.
5. Add the dissolved anchovies to the pan and stir well to combine.
6. Season the sauce with salt, chopped chives, ground nutmeg, and verjuice. Stir to combine.
7. Return the fried eel fillets to the pan and coat them with the sauce.
8. Reduce the heat to low and cover the pan. Stew the eel fillets in the sauce for about 20-30 minutes, or until they are tender.
9. While the eel is stewing, heat some oil in a separate pan and fry a handful of parsley leaves until crispy. Remove the fried parsley from the pan and set aside.
10. Once the eel is tender, garnish the dish with the fried parsley.
11. Serve the ragoo of eel-pomts hot.
