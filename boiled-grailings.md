# Boiled Grailings

## Description
Boiled Grailings is a traditional 18th-century dish made with fish, specifically grailings. Grailings are cleaned and scotched (scored) before being boiled in a flavorful mixture of beer, vinegar, water, and white wine. The dish is then served with a melted butter sauce, garnished with shaved horseradish, sliced lemon, and a sprinkle of powdered ginger.

## Ingredients:
- Grailings (substitute with white fish fillets such as cod or haddock)
- Salt
- Stale beer
- Vinegar
- Water
- White wine
- Handful of horseradish, sliced
- Bunch of rosemary
- Winter savory
- Thyme
- Parsley
- Butter
- Shaved horseradish
- Powdered ginger
- Lemon, sliced

## Instructions:
1. Clean the grailings (or white fish fillets) by removing any scales, guts, and fins. Rinse them in salted water and pat dry with a cloth.
2. Score the fish on one side, making shallow cuts along the length of the fillets.
3. In a stew-pan, combine stale beer, vinegar, water, and white wine in quantities that will cover the fish.
4. Add a good amount of salt, the sliced horseradish, and the bunch of rosemary, winter savory, thyme, and parsley to the stew-pan.
5. Place the stew-pan over a high heat and bring the liquid to a rapid boil.
6. Once the liquid is boiling, carefully add the grailings (or fish fillets) one by one, ensuring they do not cool the liquid and slow down the boiling process.
7. While the fish is boiling, take a small amount of the cooking liquid and mix it with butter to create a melted butter sauce.
8. Boil the grailings (or fish fillets) for a few minutes until they are cooked through. The exact cooking time will depend on the thickness of the fish.
9. Once cooked, carefully remove the grailings (or fish fillets) from the stew-pan and drain them.
10. Place the grailings (or fish fillets) on a serving dish and pour the melted butter sauce over them.
11. Sprinkle the dish with shaved horseradish and a little powdered ginger.
12. Garnish the sides of the dish with sliced lemon.
13. Serve the boiled grailings (or fish fillets) immediately.

## Cooking time
Approximately 20-30 minutes, depending on the thickness of the fish fillets.
