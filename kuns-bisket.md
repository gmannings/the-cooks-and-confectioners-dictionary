# Kuns Bisket

## Description
Kuns Bisket is a delicate almond-flavored cake that was popular in the 18th century. It is made with a combination of almond, sugar, eggs, flour, and citrus zest. The cakes are baked until golden and then turned out to harden the bottoms. Before returning to the oven, they are dusted with powdered sugar for a sweet finish.

## Ingredients:
- 12 egg whites
- 1 pound (450g) almonds, blanched
- 12 egg yolks
- 2 pounds (900g) fine sugar
- 1/2 pound (225g) all-purpose flour
- Zest of 4 lemons
- Citron, shredded
- Double refined sugar for dusting
- Butter for greasing the pans

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F).
2. In a large bowl, beat the egg whites until they form stiff peaks.
3. In a food processor or blender, grind the blanched almonds until they form a fine powder.
4. Gently fold the almond powder into the beaten egg whites.
5. In a separate bowl, beat the egg yolks and fine sugar together until well combined.
6. Add the almond and egg white mixture to the egg yolks and sugar mixture. Mix well.
7. Gradually add the flour to the mixture, stirring until fully incorporated.
8. Stir in the grated lemon zest and shredded citron.
9. Grease the cake pans with butter and fill them halfway with the batter.
10. Place the pans in the preheated oven and bake for approximately 20-25 minutes, or until the cakes are golden brown.
11. Remove the cakes from the oven and carefully turn them out onto a wire rack to cool.
12. Once the bottoms of the cakes have hardened, dust them with double refined sugar.
13. Return the cakes to the oven for an additional 5 minutes to allow the sugar to melt and create a sweet crust.
14. Remove the cakes from the oven and let them cool completely before serving.
