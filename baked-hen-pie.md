# Baked Hen Pie

## Description
This recipe is for a traditional 18th century dish called Baked Hen Pie. It involves parboiling a hen and then baking it in a pie with various other ingredients such as sausages, oysters, and sweetbreads. The pie is then finished with a flavorful broth made with claret, butter, and egg yolk.

## Options and commentary
- Instead of a whole hen, you can use chicken pieces such as thighs and breasts for a smaller portion.
- If you don't have access to some of the traditional ingredients like sweetbreads or lamb stones, you can omit them or substitute with other ingredients like mushrooms or bacon.
- The use of claret in the broth can be replaced with red wine or beef broth for a similar flavor.

## Ingredients:
- 1 whole hen (or chicken pieces)
- Salt and pepper, to taste
- 1/2 teaspoon ground mace
- 1/2 teaspoon ground cloves
- 4 sausages
- 8-10 oysters
- 2 sweetbreads (optional)
- 1 sheet of puff pastry
- 2 tablespoons butter
- 1/2 cup strong broth (beef or chicken)
- 1/2 cup claret (or red wine)
- 1 egg yolk

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F).
2. In a large pot, bring water to a boil and parboil the hen for about 10 minutes. Remove the hen from the pot and let it cool slightly.
3. Cut off the legs and wings of the hen and set them aside. Cut through the breastbone and break the bones of the carcass so that it can fit into the pie.
4. Season the hen pieces with salt, pepper, ground mace, and ground cloves.
5. Place the seasoned hen pieces into a pie dish or a deep baking dish.
6. Add the sausages, oysters, and sweetbreads (if using) to the dish, distributing them evenly around the hen pieces.
7. Dot the top of the ingredients with butter.
8. Roll out the puff pastry sheet and cover the dish with it, sealing the edges.
9. Make a small slit in the center of the pastry to allow steam to escape.
10. Place the dish in the preheated oven and bake for about 1 hour, or until the pastry is golden brown and the hen is cooked through.
11. In a small saucepan, combine the strong broth, claret (or red wine), and the yolk of an egg. Whisk them together until well combined.
12. Remove the pie from the oven and carefully pour the broth mixture into the slit in the pastry, allowing it to seep into the pie.
13. Return the pie to the oven for an additional 10 minutes to allow the broth to heat through.
14. Remove the pie from the oven and let it cool slightly before serving.
