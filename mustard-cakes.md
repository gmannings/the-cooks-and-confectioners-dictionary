# Mustard Cakes

## Description
Mustard cakes are small, dry cakes made with mustard, cinnamon, vinegar, and honey. They were commonly used in the 18th century as a condiment to add flavor to dishes. The cakes are dried in an oven or in the sun and can be stored for later use. When needed, they are dissolved in vinegar, verjuice, or wine to create a mustard sauce.

## Ingredients:
- 4 ounces of mustard seeds
- 1 ounce of cinnamon
- Vinegar
- Honey

## Instructions:
1. In a mortar, combine the mustard seeds, cinnamon, vinegar, and honey.
2. Use a pestle to grind and mix the ingredients together until they form a fine paste.
3. Shape the paste into small cakes.
4. Place the cakes on a baking sheet and dry them in a preheated oven at a low temperature or in the sun until they are completely dry and hard.
5. Once the cakes are dry, store them in an airtight container until ready to use.
6. When you want to use the mustard cakes, dissolve them in vinegar, verjuice, or wine to create a mustard sauce. Adjust the amount of liquid to achieve the desired consistency.
