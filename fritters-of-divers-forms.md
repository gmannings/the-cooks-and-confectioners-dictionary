# Fritters of Divers Forms

## Description
These fritters are made with a batter of flour, almond milk, white wine, sugar, and saffron. The batter is then poured into tin molds of various shapes, such as birds, dolphins, and flowers. The molds are then cooked in a pan with suet or clarified butter.

## Options and commentary
- You can use almond milk or regular milk as a substitute for almond milk.
- If you don't have tin molds, you can use silicone molds or simply drop spoonfuls of batter into the pan to make round fritters.
- Instead of suet, you can use vegetable oil or butter for frying.

## Ingredients:
- 500g fine flour
- 500ml almond milk (or regular milk)
- 100ml white wine
- 50g sugar
- A pinch of saffron
- Suet or clarified butter (for frying)

## Instructions:
1. In a large bowl, sift the flour to remove any lumps.
2. In a separate bowl, mix the almond milk, white wine, sugar, and saffron together until well combined.
3. Gradually pour the liquid mixture into the sifted flour, stirring continuously to form a smooth batter. The consistency should be similar to pancake batter.
4. If using tin molds, preheat a pan over medium heat and grease it with suet or clarified butter.
5. Fill the tin molds with the batter, making sure not to overfill them.
6. Place the filled molds in the greased pan and cook for a few minutes on each side until golden brown. If using silicone molds or making round fritters, drop spoonfuls of batter into the pan and flatten slightly with the back of the spoon.
7. Once cooked, remove the fritters from the pan and drain them on a paper towel to remove any excess oil.
8. Repeat the process with the remaining batter until all the fritters are cooked.
9. Serve the fritters warm, either as a sweet treat on their own or with a dusting of powdered sugar, honey, or a fruit sauce.

## Cooking time
Approximately 20-30 minutes, depending on the size and thickness of the fritters.
