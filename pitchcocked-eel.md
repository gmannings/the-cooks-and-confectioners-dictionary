# Pitchcocked Eel

## Description
Pitchcocked eel is a dish made from splitting and grilling a large eel. The eel is seasoned with butter, vinegar, and salt, and then served with a butter and lemon sauce. It is a simple and flavorful dish that highlights the natural taste of the eel.

## Ingredients:
- 1 large eel
- Butter

3. Season the eel pieces with salt.
4. Place the eel pieces on the grill and cook them over a gentle fire. 
5. While grilling, baste the eel pieces with a mixture of melted butter, vinegar, and salt.

7. Remove the eel from the grill and transfer it to a serving platter.
8. In a small saucepan, melt some butter and add the juice of a lemon. Heat the mixture until it is warmed through.
9. Pour the butter and lemon sauce over the grilled eel pieces.
