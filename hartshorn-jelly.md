# Hartshorn Jelly

## Description
Hartshorn Jelly is a traditional 18th-century jelly made from boiling hartshorn (deer antler) to create a gelatinous texture. It is flavored with Rhenish wine, sugar, eggs, spices, and lemon juice. The jelly is then strained and poured into glasses for serving.

## Ingredients:
- 225g hartshorn
- 3 liters water
- 500ml Rhenish wine
- 250g granulated sugar
- 4 egg whites
- 6 cloves
- 1 blade of mace
- 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon
- Juice of 3-4 lemons

## Instructions:
1. In a large pot, combine the hartshorn and water. Place over a gentle fire and bring to a boil.
2. Continue boiling the hartshorn and water mixture until it reaches a jelly-like consistency. To test if it's ready, take out a small amount with a spoon and let it cool. If it hangs on the spoon, it is ready.
3. Strain the mixture to remove the hartshorn solids while it is still hot.
4. Once the mixture has cooled, transfer it to a well-tinned brass pan.
5. Add the Rhenish wine and granulated sugar to the pan.
6. In a separate bowl, beat the egg whites until frothy.
7. Add the beaten egg whites, cloves, mace, and cinnamon to the pan. Mix well to combine.
8. Place the pan over a clear fire and keep stirring with a ladle.
9. To ensure the eggs mix well with the jelly, pour the mixture in as if you were cooling something.
10. Allow the jelly to boil for 2-3 minutes.
11. Add the juice of 3-4 lemons to the pan and continue boiling for another minute or two.
12. The jelly is ready when it is finely curled and has a pure white color.
13. Place a swan-skin jelly bag over a saucepan or dish.
14. Carefully pour the jelly into the jelly bag using a ladle. Start by pouring in the first half gently.
15. Allow the jelly to strain through the bag until it becomes as clear as rockwater.
16. Transfer the strained jelly into glasses for serving.
