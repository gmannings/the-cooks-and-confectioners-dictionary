# Farced and Roasted Veal

## Description
This recipe involves stuffing and roasting a cut of veal, resulting in a flavorful and tender dish. The veal is stuffed with a mixture of minced beef, suet, herbs, spices, breadcrumbs, dates, and pine nuts. It is then roasted until cooked through. A sauce made with butter, vinegar, cinnamon, ginger, and sugar is poured over the roasted veal, and the dish is garnished with slices of lemon.

## Ingredients:
- 1 veal loin or shoulder
- 200g minced beef
- 50g suet, finely chopped
- 1 tablespoon fresh marjoram, finely chopped
- 1 tablespoon fresh winter savory, finely chopped
- 1 tablespoon fresh thyme, finely chopped
- Salt, to taste
- 1/2 teaspoon ground cloves
- 1/2 teaspoon ground mace
- 50g grated breadcrumbs
- 4-5 dates, finely chopped
- 1 handful of blanched pine nuts
- 1 egg yolk
- 2 tablespoons verjuice (or substitute with white wine vinegar)
- 50g butter
- 1 tablespoon vinegar
- 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
- 1/2 teaspoon ground ginger
- 1 teaspoon sugar
- Slices of lemon, for garnish

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F).
2. In a bowl, combine the minced beef, suet, marjoram, winter savory, thyme, salt, cloves, mace, breadcrumbs, dates, pine nuts, egg yolk, and verjuice. Mix well to combine all the ingredients.
3. Make small holes in the veal loin or shoulder and stuff it generously with the prepared mixture.
4. Spit the veal and place it on a roasting rack or tray.
5. Roast the veal in the preheated oven for about 1 hour, or until cooked through. Baste the veal occasionally with the pan juices.
6. While the veal is roasting, prepare the sauce. In a saucepan, melt the butter over medium heat. Add the vinegar, cinnamon, ginger, and sugar. Stir well to combine and cook for a few minutes until the sauce thickens slightly.
7. Once the veal is cooked, remove it from the oven and let it rest for a few minutes.
8. Slice the veal and arrange it on a serving platter. Pour the prepared sauce over the veal.
9. Garnish with slices of lemon and serve.
