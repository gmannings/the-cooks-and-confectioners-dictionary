# Lemon Cakes

## Description
Lemon Cakes are sweet treats made with a mixture of sugar and lemon juice. The sugar is boiled until it reaches a candy-like consistency and then dropped onto plates. The cakes are then allowed to cool until they can be easily removed from the plates. Optionally, you can also add finely shredded lemon peel to the mixture for added flavor.

## Options and commentary
- You can adjust the amount of lemon juice according to your taste preference. If you prefer a stronger lemon flavor, you can add more juice.
- Adding finely shredded lemon peel will give the cakes a more intense lemon aroma and flavor.
- These Lemon Cakes are similar to lemon drops or lemon candies.

## Ingredients:
- 200g double-refined sugar
- Juice of 2 lemons
- Finely shredded peel of 1 lemon (optional)

## Instructions:
1. In a saucepan, combine the sugar and lemon juice.
2. Place the saucepan over medium heat and stir until the sugar has dissolved.
3. Continue to cook the mixture, stirring occasionally, until it reaches a candy-like consistency. This will take approximately 10-15 minutes.
4. Optional: If using lemon peel, add it to the mixture and continue to cook for an additional 2-3 minutes.
5. Prepare plates by greasing them lightly with oil or lining them with parchment paper.
6. Once the mixture has reached the desired consistency, carefully drop spoonfuls of it onto the prepared plates. Leave some space between each drop.
7. Allow the cakes to cool completely on the plates. They should become firm and easily removable.
8. Once cooled, gently remove the Lemon Cakes from the plates using a spatula or your fingers.
9. Serve and enjoy!
