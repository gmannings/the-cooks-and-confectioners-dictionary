# Flewed Rabbits the French Way

## Description
This recipe is a modernized version of an 18th-century dish called "Flewed Rabbits the French Way." It involves dividing the rabbits into quarters, larding them with bacon, frying them, and then stewing them in a flavorful broth with white wine, herbs, flour, and orange. The result is a delicious and tender rabbit dish with a rich and aromatic sauce.

## Options and commentary
- Instead of rabbits, you can use chicken or any other poultry of your choice.
- If you don't have bacon lardons, you can use regular bacon cut into small strips.
- Feel free to adjust the seasoning according to your taste preferences.
- Serve the dish with mashed potatoes or crusty bread to soak up the flavorful sauce.

## Ingredients:
- 2 rabbits, quartered (or chicken pieces)
- 200g bacon, cut into lardons (or regular bacon cut into small strips)
- 500ml strong broth (chicken or vegetable)
- 250ml white wine
- Salt and pepper to taste
- 1 faggot of sweet herbs (a bundle of fresh herbs such as thyme, parsley, and bay leaves tied together with kitchen twine)
- 2 tablespoons flour
- 1 orange, zest and juice

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F).

2. In a large frying pan, cook the bacon lardons over medium heat until they are crispy. Remove the lardons from the pan and set them aside.

3. Season the rabbit quarters with salt and pepper. In the same frying pan, brown the rabbit pieces on all sides until they are golden brown. Remove the rabbit pieces from the pan and set them aside.

4. In a large earthenware or oven-safe pan, combine the strong broth, white wine, salt, pepper, faggot of sweet herbs, fried flour, and the zest and juice of the orange. Stir well to combine.

5. Add the browned rabbit pieces and the cooked bacon lardons to the pan with the broth mixture. Make sure the rabbit pieces are submerged in the liquid.

6. Cover the pan with a lid or aluminum foil and place it in the preheated oven. Cook for about 1.5 to 2 hours, or until the rabbit is tender and cooked through.

7. Once the rabbit is cooked, remove it from the oven and transfer the pieces to a serving platter.

8. Strain the cooking liquid through a fine-mesh sieve into a saucepan. Bring the liquid to a simmer over medium heat and cook until it has reduced and thickened slightly.

9. Pour the sauce over the rabbit pieces and serve hot.

## Cooking time
Approximately 1.5 to 2 hours.
