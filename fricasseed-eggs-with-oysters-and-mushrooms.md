# Fricasseed Eggs with Oysters and Mushrooms

## Description
Fricasseed eggs with oysters and mushrooms is a rich and flavorful dish that combines boiled eggs with a creamy sauce made from white Port wine, gravy, and spices. The addition of oysters and mushrooms adds a delicious seafood and earthy flavor to the dish. The eggs are served with a side of spinach and garnished with lemon and crispy bread slices.

## Options and commentary
- Instead of white Port wine, you can use a dry white wine as a substitute.
- If you don't have access to fresh oysters, you can use canned or frozen oysters.
- If you prefer a vegetarian version, you can omit the oysters and use vegetable broth instead of gravy.
- Feel free to adjust the amount of salt, pepper, and spices according to your taste preferences.

## Ingredients:
- 12 hard-boiled eggs, peeled and quartered
- 180 ml white Port wine (or dry white wine)
- 360 ml good quality gravy (or vegetable broth for vegetarian version)
- Salt and pepper to taste
- 2 blades of mace
- 100 g oysters
- 100 g mushrooms, sliced
- 30 g butter
- 1 egg yolk
- 1 tablespoon flour
- 200 g spinach
- 200 g large oysters (optional)
- Lemon slices for garnish
- Crispy bread slices for garnish

## Instructions:
1. In a stewpan, combine the quartered hard-boiled eggs, white Port wine, gravy, salt, pepper, and blades of mace.
2. Add the oysters and mushrooms to the stewpan.
3. In a separate bowl, mix the butter, egg yolk, and flour to make a thick sauce.
4. Add the sauce to the stewpan and stir well to combine all the ingredients.
5. Place the stewpan on the stove over medium heat and cook, stirring occasionally, until the sauce thickens and the oysters and mushrooms are cooked through (about 10-15 minutes).
6. While the eggs are cooking, prepare the spinach by blanching it in boiling water for a few minutes until wilted. Drain and set aside.
7. If using large oysters, cook them separately in a pan until they are cooked through.
8. Arrange the fricasseed eggs on a serving dish, surround them with the cooked large oysters (if using), and garnish with lemon slices and crispy bread slices.
9. Serve the fricasseed eggs with a side of spinach.
