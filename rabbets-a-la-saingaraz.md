# Rabbets a la Saingaraz

## Description
Rabbets a la Saingaraz is a classic 18th-century dish featuring roasted rabbit served with a flavorful sauce made from bacon, gravy, herbs, vinegar, and cullis. The dish is rich and savory, perfect for a special occasion or a fancy dinner.

## Ingredients:
- 2 rabbit (or substitute with chicken thighs or pork loin)
- 4 slices of bacon
- 2 tablespoons flour
- 1 cup good quality gravy
- 1 faggot of sweet herbs (such as thyme, rosemary, and parsley)
- 2 tablespoons vinegar
- 1 cup cullis (a thickened meat stock or broth)

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F).
2. Lard the rabbits by inserting small strips of bacon into the meat. This will help keep the meat moist during roasting.
3. Place the larded rabbits on a roasting rack and roast in the preheated oven for about 45 minutes to 1 hour, or until the meat is cooked through and tender. Remove from the oven and let them rest for a few minutes.
4. While the rabbits are roasting, prepare the sauce. Cut the remaining bacon slices into small pieces and place them in a stewpan. Cook over medium heat until the bacon is crispy and the fat has rendered.
5. Add the flour to the stewpan and cook for a minute, stirring constantly, to create a roux.
6. Pour in the gravy and add the faggot of sweet herbs. Stir well to combine.
7. Reduce the heat to low and let the sauce simmer for about 10 minutes to allow the flavors to meld together.
8. Stir in the vinegar and cullis, and continue to simmer for another 5 minutes to thicken the sauce.
9. Remove the faggot of sweet herbs from the sauce.
10. Quarter the roasted rabbits and arrange them on a serving platter.
11. Remove any excess fat from the bacon slices and place them on top of the rabbits.
12. Pour the sauce over the rabbits and bacon, ensuring they are well coated.
13. Serve the Rabbets a la Saingaraz hot and enjoy!
