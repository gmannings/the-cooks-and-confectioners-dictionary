## Description
Soop de Sante is a traditional 18th-century French fish soup made with a variety of vegetables and fish broth. It is a hearty and flavorful dish that is perfect for fish days or as a light meal.

## Ingredients:
- 2 stalks of celery
- 1 endive
- 1 bunch of sorrel
- 1 small bunch of chervil or cabbage lettuce
- 1 small onion
- 2 tablespoons butter
- 1 cup water from boiled peas or hot water
- 1 tablespoon flour
- 2 cups fish broth
- 1 glass of white wine
- Salt and pepper to taste
- 1 onion, stuck with cloves
- 1 small bunch of parsley, shredded
- 1 faggot of savory herbs (such as thyme, bay leaves, and parsley)
- 1 French roll
- 2 turnips, peeled and sliced
- 2 carrots, peeled and sliced

## Instructions:
1. Mince the celery, endive, sorrel, and chervil or cabbage lettuce using a knife. Wash them thoroughly and squeeze out any excess water.
2. In a saucepan, melt the butter over medium heat. Add the minced vegetables and the small onion, finely chopped. Toss them in the butter until they are coated.
3. Remove any excess fat from the saucepan. Add the water from boiled peas or hot water to the vegetables. Let them boil until they become tender.
4. Sprinkle the flour over the vegetables and keep stirring until it turns brown.
5. Pour in the fish broth and the glass of white wine. Season the soup with salt, pepper, the onion stuck with cloves, shredded parsley, and the faggot of savory herbs.
6. Fry the French roll until it becomes crispy. Remove the crumb from the bottom of the roll.
7. Cover the bottom of a soup dish with the crust of French rolls. Place it over a chafing dish of coals.
8. Lay the herbs on top of the crust in the dish. Then pour the soup over the crust and herbs. Let it simmer for a while to soak the bread.
9. Garnish the soup with sliced turnips and carrots.
