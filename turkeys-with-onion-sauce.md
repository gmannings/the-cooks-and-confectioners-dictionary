# Turkeys with Onion Sauce

## Description
This recipe is for roasted turkeys served with a flavorful onion sauce. The onions are fried in lard, then cooked with flour, gravy, and seasonings to create a rich and savory sauce. The roasted turkey is then topped with the sauce and garnished before serving.

## Ingredients:
- 1 turkey
- 2 onions, sliced
- Lard (or vegetable oil)
- Pinch of flour
- Gravy
- Cloves
- Pepper
- Salt
- Bread crumbs (for bread cullis)
- Verjuice (or lemon juice)

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to the appropriate temperature for roasting a turkey.
2. In a stewpan, heat some lard (or vegetable oil) and add the sliced onions. Fry the onions until they are golden brown.
3. Remove the onions from the stewpan and drain off some of the fat.
4. Return the onions to the stewpan and sprinkle them with a pinch of flour. Toss the onions to coat them with the flour.
5. Add the gravy, cloves, pepper, salt, and any other desired seasonings to the stewpan with the onions. Stir well to combine.
6. Allow the onions and sauce to simmer until they are cooked and the flavors have melded together.
7. Strain the onion sauce through a fine-mesh sieve or a hair sieve to remove any lumps or solids.
8. Prepare a bread cullis by soaking bread crumbs in a small amount of water or broth until they form a thick paste.
9. Add the bread cullis and a few drops of verjuice (or lemon juice) to the strained onion sauce. Stir well to combine.
10. While the sauce is being prepared, roast the turkey in the preheated oven until it is cooked through and golden brown.
11. Once the turkey is cooked, remove it from the oven and transfer it to a serving dish.
12. Pour the prepared onion sauce over the roasted turkey, ensuring that it is evenly coated.
13. Garnish the turkey with any desired toppings, such as fresh herbs or sliced lemons.
14. Serve the turkeys with onion sauce immediately.

## Cooking time
The cooking time for the turkey will vary depending on its size and the oven temperature. As a general guideline, roast the turkey for about 20 minutes per pound (450 grams) at a temperature of 325째F (163째C). Use a meat thermometer to ensure that the internal temperature of the turkey reaches 165째F (74째C) before removing it from the oven.
