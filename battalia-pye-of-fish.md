# Battalia Pye of Fish

## Description
A Battalia Pye of Fish is a large pie with a decorative crust resembling battlements. It is filled with a variety of fish and seafood, including salmon, and is served with a rich sauce made from cockles, prawns, oysters, and periwinkles.

## Options and commentary
- You can use any combination of fish and seafood that you prefer or is available to you.
- The pie crust can be homemade or store-bought.
- The sauce can be thickened with a roux or cornstarch instead of drawn butter.

## Ingredients:
- 1 large pie crust
- 1 salmon head
- Assorted fish fillets (e.g., cod, haddock, trout)
- Assorted seafood (e.g., cockles, prawns, oysters, periwinkles)
- Forced meat (for stuffing the fish heads)
- Eggs (for glazing the pie crust)
- Flour (for dusting the pie crust)
- Butter (for the drawn butter sauce)
- Salt and pepper (to season)

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F).
2. Roll out the pie crust and line a large pie dish, leaving some excess dough for the battlements.
3. Cut the excess dough into battlement shapes and set aside.
4. Dry the pie crust well and brush the inside with beaten egg yolks.
5. Dust the bottom of the pie crust with flour.
6. Precook the fish fillets by either grilling or frying them until browned.
7. Place the salmon head, cut larger than the gills, in the center of the pie crust.
8. Stuff the other fish heads with forced meat and place them on top of the battlements.
9. Arrange the cooked fish fillets and assorted seafood in their respective sections of the pie crust, opposite each other.
10. In a saucepan, combine the cockles, prawns, oysters, and periwinkles. Add enough water to cover and simmer until cooked.
11. Drain the seafood, reserving the cooking liquid.
12. In a separate saucepan, melt butter and stir in an equal amount of flour to make a roux.
13. Gradually whisk in the reserved cooking liquid to make a thick sauce.
14. Season the sauce with salt and pepper to taste.
15. Pour the sauce over the fish and seafood in the pie crust.
16. Place the battlements on top of the pie crust, using beaten egg yolks to secure them.
17. Brush the entire pie crust with beaten egg yolks for a golden finish.
18. Bake the pie in the preheated oven for approximately 45 minutes or until the crust is golden brown and the filling is heated through.
