# Calf's Ghaldzon Pie

## Description
Calf's Ghaldzon Pie is a traditional 18th-century dish made with minced calf's chaldron (a cut of meat), flavored with spices, verjuice (a sour juice), currants, and lemon peel. The mixture is then baked in a pie crust.

## Options and commentary
- You can use beef or veal as a modern alternative to calf's chaldron.
- If verjuice is not available, you can substitute it with a mixture of lemon juice and white wine vinegar.
- You can adjust the amount of spices and sugar according to your taste preferences.

## Ingredients:
- 500g minced beef or veal
- 50g marrow (or substitute with butter)
- 1/2 teaspoon pepper
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg
- 1/4 teaspoon ground cloves
- 1/4 teaspoon ground mace
- 2 tablespoons verjuice (or 1 tablespoon lemon juice + 1 tablespoon white wine vinegar)
- 50g currants
- 2 tablespoons grated bread
- 1 tablespoon sugar
- 1 teaspoon lemon zest, finely shredded
- 1 pie crust (store-bought or homemade)

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F).
2. In a large bowl, combine the minced beef or veal, marrow (or butter), pepper, salt, nutmeg, cloves, and mace. Mix well to evenly distribute the spices.
3. Add the verjuice (or lemon juice + white wine vinegar), currants, grated bread, sugar, and lemon zest to the meat mixture. Stir until all the ingredients are well combined.
4. Roll out the pie crust and line a pie dish with it.
5. Pour the meat mixture into the pie crust, spreading it evenly.
6. Cover the pie with another layer of pie crust, sealing the edges by crimping or pressing with a fork.
7. Make a few small slits on the top crust to allow steam to escape during baking.
8. Place the pie dish on a baking sheet to catch any drips, and then transfer it to the preheated oven.
9. Bake for approximately 45-50 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown and the filling is cooked through.
10. Remove the pie from the oven and let it cool for a few minutes before serving.
