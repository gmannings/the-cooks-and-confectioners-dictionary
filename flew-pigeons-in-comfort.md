# Flew Pigeons in Comfort

## Description
Flew Pigeons in Comfort is a dish made with parboiled and larded pigeons, cooked in a braise or between two fires. The pigeons are then served with a ragout made from fowl livers, cockscombs, mushrooms, and truffles, tossed in melted bacon and gravy. This dish is rich and flavorful, perfect as a first course for a special occasion.

## Ingredients:
- 4 pigeons
- 8 large lardons (thick strips of bacon)
- Salt and pepper to taste
- Spices (such as cloves, nutmeg, and cinnamon) to taste
- 2 tablespoons chopped chives
- 2 tablespoons chopped parsley
- 2 tablespoons chopped sweet herbs (such as thyme, rosemary, and sage)
- 4 fowl livers
- 8 cockscombs
- 8 mushrooms, sliced
- 4 truffles, sliced
- 2 tablespoons melted bacon fat
- 1 cup gravy
- 1 cup veal and ham cullis (thickened sauce made from veal and ham stock)

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F).
2. Truss the pigeons by tying their legs neatly into their bodies.
3. Bring a large pot of water to a boil and parboil the pigeons for 5 minutes. Remove from the pot and set aside.
4. In a small bowl, mix together the salt, pepper, spices, chives, parsley, and sweet herbs.
5. Take each lardon and season it with the herb mixture. Insert the lardons into the breasts of the pigeons.
6. Heat a large, oven-safe skillet over medium-high heat. Place the pigeons in the skillet and sear them on all sides until golden brown.
7. Transfer the skillet to the preheated oven and cook the pigeons for 20-25 minutes, or until they are cooked through and the juices run clear. Remove from the oven and set aside.
8. In a separate stew-pan, melt the bacon fat over medium heat. Add the fowl livers, cockscombs, mushrooms, and truffles. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the livers are browned and the mushrooms are tender.
9. Pour in the gravy and simmer the mixture over low heat for 10 minutes, allowing the flavors to meld together.
10. Clear the fat from the surface of the mixture and add the veal and ham cullis. Stir well to combine and continue to simmer for another 5 minutes, until the sauce has thickened slightly.
11. Remove the pigeons from the skillet and drain them on a paper towel to remove any excess fat.
12. Place the pigeons in the ragout mixture and simmer them for a few minutes to absorb the flavors.
13. Transfer the pigeons to a serving dish and pour the ragout over them.
14. Serve the Flew Pigeons in Comfort hot as a first course.
