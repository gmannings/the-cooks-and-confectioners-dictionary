# Pickled Green Beans

## Description
This recipe is for pickling young green beans in a white-wine vinegar brine. The pickling process gives the beans a tangy and slightly spicy flavor. These pickled green beans can be enjoyed as a snack or used as a condiment in various dishes.

## Ingredients:
- 500g young green beans
- 500ml white-wine vinegar
- 2 tablespoons salt
- 1 piece of ginger (about 2cm), cut into thick slices
- 1 teaspoon whole peppercorns

## Instructions:
1. Top and tail the young green beans, removing the ends.
2. In a large bowl, combine the white-wine vinegar, salt, ginger slices, and whole peppercorns. Stir well to dissolve the salt.
3. Add the green beans to the vinegar mixture and ensure they are fully submerged.
4. Cover the bowl and refrigerate for nine days, allowing the beans to marinate in the cold pickle.
5. After nine days, transfer the pickle mixture to a brass kettle and bring it to a boil.
6. Once the pickle mixture is boiling, add the green beans and let them boil for just one minute.
7. Remove the kettle from the heat and cover it tightly. Allow the beans to sit in the covered kettle.
8. After a few hours, return the kettle to the heat and bring it to a boil again. Let the beans boil for one minute.
9. Repeat steps 7 and 8 six more times, until the beans turn a vibrant green color.
10. Once the beans are as green as grass, transfer them to sterilized jars and seal them tightly.
11. Store the pickled green beans in a cool, dark place. They will keep for up to a year.

## Cooking time
Approximately 9 days for marinating, plus additional boiling and cooling times.
