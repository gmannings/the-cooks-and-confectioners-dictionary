# Potage a la Reyne

## Description
Potage a la Reyne is a rich and flavorful soup made with partridges, bread, herbs, and various other ingredients. It is a classic dish from the 18th century that was often served to royalty. The soup is hearty and comforting, with a combination of flavors that create a delicious and satisfying meal.

## Options and commentary
- Instead of partridges, you can use chicken or turkey as a more accessible alternative.
- If you don't have access to fresh herbs, you can use dried herbs instead, but reduce the amount by half.
- For the Cullis, you can use the breast of a roasted chicken or turkey instead of a pullet or capon.
- If you can't find truffles, you can omit them or use truffle oil for a similar flavor.
- The sweetbreads of veal and cockscombs can be omitted if you prefer a simpler version of the dish.

## Ingredients:
- 2 partridges (or chicken/turkey)
- 1 liter chicken broth
- 4 slices of bacon
- 1 lemon, sliced
- 1 roasted chicken breast, minced
- 1 cup bread crumbs
- 1 cup chicken broth (for soaking bread crumbs)
- Salt and pepper to taste
- 4 slices of black truffles (optional)
- 4 sweetbreads of veal, larded (optional)
- 4 roasted cockscombs, stuffed (optional)
- 4 slices of sweetbreads of veal in a ragout (optional)
- 4 artichoke bottoms (optional)

## Instructions:
1. Truss and scald the partridges (or chicken/turkey). 
2. In a large pot, bring the chicken broth to a boil and add the partridges, bacon slices, and lemon slices. 
3. Simmer the partridges in the broth for about 30 minutes, or until cooked through. 
4. While the partridges are cooking, make the Cullis. In a mortar, pound the minced roasted chicken breast with the soaked bread crumbs until well combined. Strain the mixture through a fine-mesh sieve to create a smooth Cullis. 
5. Transfer the Cullis to a small pot and keep it covered. 
6. In a separate bowl, soak the bread crumbs in the strained chicken broth. 
7. Once the partridges are cooked, remove them from the pot and set aside. 
8. Place the soaked bread crumbs in the pot with the broth and stir well. 
9. Return the partridges to the pot and sprinkle with some good gravy. 
10. In the middle of the potage, place a stuffed loaf made with a hash of roasted fowl, pieces of mushrooms, truffles (if using), and small asparagus tops (if in season). 
11. Arrange the partridges around the stuffed loaf. 
12. Pour the Cullis over the partridges. 
13. Create a border around the dish with larded sweetbreads of veal, roasted cockscombs (stuffed if desired), slices of sweetbreads of veal in a ragout, and artichoke bottoms. 
14. Cover the breasts of the partridges with slices of black truffles (if using).
