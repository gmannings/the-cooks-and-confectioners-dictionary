# Apricot Candies

## Description
Apricot candies are a sweet and fruity treat made from ripe apricots and sugar. The apricots are cooked down into a thick and clear mixture, then mixed with a candy syrup and left to dry. These candies have a delightful apricot flavor and a chewy texture.

## Ingredients:
- Ripe apricots
- Double refined sugar

## Instructions:
1. Start by preparing the apricots. Peel the ripe apricots and remove the pits. 
2. Place the apricots in a pot and cover them with just enough water to submerge them.
3. Bring the water to a boil and let the apricots cook until they are tender. This should take about 10-15 minutes.
4. Drain the cooked apricots and let them cool slightly.
5. Once cooled, break the apricots into smaller pieces and strain them to remove any remaining solids. You should be left with a smooth apricot puree.
6. Measure the weight of the apricot puree and prepare half as much double refined sugar.
7. In a clean pot, combine the apricot puree and the measured sugar.
8. Place the pot over medium heat and stir the mixture continuously until the sugar has dissolved completely.
9. Continue cooking the mixture, stirring occasionally, until it thickens and becomes clear. This should take about 20-30 minutes.
10. While the apricot mixture is cooking, prepare a candy syrup. Take an equal amount of sugar as the weight of the apricot puree and wet it with water.
11. Place the sugar and water mixture in a separate pot and bring it to a boil.
12. Skim off any impurities that rise to the surface of the syrup.
13. Continue boiling the syrup until it reaches the candy stage. To test if the syrup has reached the right consistency, drop a small amount into a bowl of cold water. It should form a firm ball that holds its shape.
14. Once the apricot mixture has thickened and the candy syrup has reached the right consistency, remove both pots from the heat.
15. Pour the candy syrup into the apricot mixture and stir well to combine. Be careful not to let the mixture boil.
16. Transfer the mixture into glass jars and place them in a warm and dry place, such as a stove or an oven set to a low temperature.
17. Leave the candies to dry and candy for several days, turning them occasionally to ensure even drying.
18. Once the candies are completely dry, remove them from the glass jars and place them on glass plates.
19. Let the candies stand in the warm and dry place for a few more days until they are fully dry and firm.
20. Finally, transfer the apricot candies into boxes for storage.
