# Baked Sea-Fowls

## Description
This recipe is for baking various types of sea-fowls, such as swan. The fowl is parboiled, larded, and seasoned with spices. It is then placed in a pie with butter, cloves, and more seasoning. The pie is covered with pastry and baked until cooked. The recipe provides options for serving the fowl hot or cold, with different garnishes and sauces.

## Options and commentary
- You can use any type of sea-fowl for this recipe, such as swan, goose, or duck.
- If you prefer to eat the fowl hot, use only half of the seasoning.
- For a hot serving, you can add a large onion, gooseberries or grapes, capers or oysters to the pie, and garnish with butter, gravy, and claret.
- For a cold serving, you can bake the fowl in earthen pots for longer preservation.

## Ingredients:
- 1 sea-fowl (swan, goose, duck, etc.)
- Large lard for larding
- Pepper
- Nutmeg
- 4 ounces (113 grams) salt
- 3 ounces (85 grams) nutmeg
- 2 ounces (57 grams) pepper
- Butter
- Whole cloves
- Rye-paste or coarse bolted meal
- Scalding-hot liquor (water or broth)
- Optional garnishes for hot serving:
  - Large onion
  - Gooseberries or grapes
  - Capers or oysters
  - Butter
  - Gravy
  - Claret

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to the appropriate temperature for baking pies (usually around 180°C or 350°F).
2. Parboil the sea-fowl by partially cooking it in boiling water for a few minutes.
3. Lard the sea-fowl by inserting strips of large lard into the meat.
4. Season the lard with pepper and nutmeg.
5. Season the sea-fowl with salt, nutmeg, and pepper. Use 4 ounces of salt, 3 ounces of nutmeg, and 2 ounces of pepper in total.
6. Place the sea-fowl into a pie dish.
7. Add a generous amount of butter to the pie dish.
8. Sprinkle whole cloves over the sea-fowl and the butter.
9. If you are serving the fowl hot, add a large onion, gooseberries or grapes, and capers or oysters to the pie dish.
10. Pour butter, gravy, and claret over the garnishes (if using) in the pie dish.
11. Cover the sea-fowl and garnishes with large sheets of lard.
12. Place a good quantity of butter on top of the lard.
13. Close up the pie by covering it with rye-paste or coarse bolted meal. Make sure the pastry is stiff by using scalding-hot liquor (water or broth) to mix the dough.
14. Bake the pie in the preheated oven until the sea-fowl is cooked through. The cooking time will vary depending on the size and type of sea-fowl used. As a general guideline, bake for approximately 1 hour for a medium-sized bird.
15. If you are serving the fowl cold, you can bake it in earthen pots instead of a pie dish for longer preservation.

## Cooking time
Approximately 1 hour (may vary depending on the size and type of sea-fowl)
