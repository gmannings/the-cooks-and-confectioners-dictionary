# Blanc-Manger of Harts-horn

## Description
Blanc-Manger is a creamy, gelatinous dessert that was popular in the 18th century. This particular recipe uses harts-horn (deer antler) as the main ingredient to create a firm jelly-like texture. The dish is flavored with almonds and orange flower-water, giving it a delicate and fragrant taste.

## Ingredients:
- 450 grams of harts-horn
- 200 grams of almonds
- Milk or cream
- Orange flower-water

## Instructions:
1. In a large pot, bring water to a boil and add the harts-horn. Boil it for a considerable amount of time until the liquid becomes thick and clammy. This may take several hours.
2. Once the harts-horn mixture has thickened, strain it through a very fine sieve to remove any impurities. Set aside.
3. In a separate bowl, pound the almonds until they form a fine paste. You can use a mortar and pestle or a food processor for this step.
4. Gradually add a little milk or cream to the pounded almonds to moisten them and create a smooth consistency.
5. Take the strained harts-horn liquid and strain it again, this time through the almond mixture. Repeat this step three or four times to ensure the blanc-manger becomes white and creamy.
6. Finally, add a little orange flower-water to the blanc-manger mixture to give it a subtle floral flavor. Adjust the amount according to your taste preferences.

## Cooking time
Several hours for boiling the harts-horn mixture.
