# Ragoo of Perches

## Description
This recipe is for a ragoo of perches, a dish made with grilled and stewed perch fillets in a flavorful sauce. The perches are first grilled to partially cook them, then the skins are removed. They are then simmered in a sauce made with fish broth, white wine, seasonings, and herbs. The dish is finished by pouring a meagre ragoo sauce over the perches before serving.

## Ingredients:
- 4 perch fillets
- 200ml fish broth
- 120ml white wine
- Salt and pepper to taste
- 1 onion
- 4 cloves
- 1 bay leaf
- A handful of parsley, finely chopped
- 30g butter
- 1 tablespoon flour

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the grill or broiler.
2. Gut the perch fillets and place them on a grill or gridiron. Grill them for a few minutes on each side until partially cooked.
3. Remove the skins from the perch fillets.
4. In a saucepan, combine the fish broth, white wine, salt, pepper, onion stuck with cloves, bay leaf, and chopped parsley. Bring the mixture to a simmer.
5. In a separate stew-pan, melt the butter over medium heat. Add the flour and cook until it turns slightly brown, stirring constantly.
6. Pour the butter and flour mixture into the saucepan with the fish broth and stir well to combine.
7. Place the partially cooked perch fillets into the sauce and simmer over low heat for about 10-15 minutes, or until the fish is fully cooked and tender.
8. Once the perches are stewed enough, remove them from the sauce and transfer them to a serving dish.
9. Prepare a meagre ragoo sauce according to the instructions in Letter R (not provided in this recipe).
10. Pour the meagre ragoo sauce over the perch fillets.
