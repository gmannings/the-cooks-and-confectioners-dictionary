# Whiten and Clear the Skin

## Description
This recipe is a traditional method for whitening and clearing the skin. It involves using a mixture of egg whites, boar's grease, and powdered bay leaves to create a skin treatment.

## Ingredients:
- 2 egg whites
- 1 tablespoon boar's grease (or substitute with unscented body lotion)
- 1 teaspoon powdered bay leaves

## Instructions:
1. In a small bowl, whisk the egg whites until they become frothy.
2. Add the boar's grease (or body lotion) to the egg whites and mix well.
3. Sprinkle the powdered bay leaves into the mixture and stir until combined.
4. Wash your face thoroughly with a gentle cleanser and pat dry.
5. Using clean hands or a brush, apply the mixture to your face, focusing on areas that you want to whiten and clear.
6. Leave the mixture on your face for about 15-20 minutes.
7. Rinse your face with lukewarm water and gently pat dry.
8. Follow up with your regular skincare routine.

## Options and commentary
- Boar's grease may not be readily available, so you can substitute it with unscented body lotion.
- Powdered bay leaves can be found in some specialty stores or online. If you can't find it, you can crush dried bay leaves into a fine powder using a mortar and pestle.
