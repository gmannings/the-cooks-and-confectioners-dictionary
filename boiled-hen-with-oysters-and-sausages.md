## Description

## Options and commentary
- You can use chicken instead of hen if desired.
- If you don't have access to fresh oysters, you can use canned oysters or omit them altogether.
- Feel free to adjust the amount of herbs and spices according to your taste preferences.

## Ingredients:
- 1 hen or chicken
- 4 slices of bacon
- 1/2 pint (250 ml) strong broth
- 1/2 cup (120 ml) white wine
- 1/2 pound (225 g) sausages
- 1-2 onions, chopped
- A handful of savory herbs (such as thyme, parsley, and sage), chopped
- 1 teaspoon ground mace
- 1/2 teaspoon grated nutmeg
- 1 tablespoon minced thyme
- 1 pint (500 ml) fresh oysters, drained
- 2 egg yolks
- 2 tablespoons butter
- Lemon slices, for garnish

## Instructions:
1. In a large pot, bring water to a boil. Add the hen or chicken and the bacon slices. Boil for about 1 hour or until the hen is cooked through. Remove the hen from the pot and set aside.
2. In a separate saucepan, combine the strong broth and white wine. Add the sausages, chopped onions, savory herbs, ground mace, grated nutmeg, minced thyme, and fresh oysters. Bring to a simmer and cook for about 10 minutes.
3. In a small bowl, whisk together the egg yolks and butter until well combined. Slowly pour this mixture into the saucepan with the sausages and oysters, stirring constantly. Cook for another 2-3 minutes until the sauce thickens.
4. Place the boiled hen on a serving dish. Pour the sauce and oysters over the hen. Arrange the sausages around the hen, with slices of bacon in between. Garnish with lemon slices.
5. Serve the boiled hen with oysters and sausages hot.
