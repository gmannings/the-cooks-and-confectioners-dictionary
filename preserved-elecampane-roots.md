# Preserved Elecampane Roots

## Description
Preserved Elecampane Roots are a sweet and slightly bitter treat made from the roots of the elecampane plant. The roots are first washed, scraped, and cut into thin strips. They are then soaked in water to remove their bitterness. After soaking, the roots are boiled until tender and then cooked in a sugar syrup until they reach the desired consistency. The preserved roots can be enjoyed as a standalone snack or used as a topping for desserts.

## Ingredients:
- Elecampane roots
- Water
- Clarified sugar

## Instructions:
1. Wash the elecampane roots thoroughly to remove any dirt or debris.
2. Scrape the roots using a vegetable peeler or a knife to remove the outer layer.
3. Cut the roots into thin strips, approximately the length of your finger.
4. Place the cut roots in a bowl and cover them with water. Allow them to soak for three days, changing the water twice a day. This will help remove the bitterness from the roots.
5. After three days of soaking, drain the roots and transfer them to a pot.
6. Add enough water to the pot to cover the roots and bring it to a boil.
7. Boil the roots until they become tender. This may take around 20-30 minutes, depending on the thickness of the roots.
8. While the roots are boiling, prepare a sugar syrup by combining 12 ounces of clarified sugar with an equal amount of water in a separate pot. Heat the mixture over a gentle fire until the sugar dissolves completely.
9. Once the roots are tender, drain them and add them to the sugar syrup.
10. Cook the roots in the sugar syrup over a gentle fire, stirring occasionally, until they reach the desired consistency. This may take around 30-40 minutes. The syrup should thicken and coat the roots.
11. Remove the pot from the heat and allow the preserved roots to cool down to room temperature.
12. Once the preserved roots are between hot and cold, transfer them to a clean, airtight container for storage.
