# Preserved Lemons

## Description
Preserved lemons are a traditional condiment commonly used in Middle Eastern and North African cuisines. They add a unique tangy and salty flavor to dishes and can be used in a variety of recipes, such as tagines, salads, and marinades.

## Ingredients:
- 4-6 lemons
- 1/4 cup salt
- Water

## Instructions:
1. Wash the lemons thoroughly to remove any dirt or wax.
2. Cut each lemon into quarters, but make sure not to cut all the way through. Leave about 1/2 inch intact at the base of the lemon.
3. Sprinkle salt generously over the cut sides of the lemons.
4. Place the salted lemons in a clean, sterilized glass jar, pressing them down firmly to release their juices.
5. Continue layering the lemons and salt until the jar is filled, leaving about 1/2 inch of headspace at the top.
6. Pour enough water into the jar to cover the lemons completely.
7. Close the jar tightly with a lid.
8. Store the jar in a cool, dark place for at least 3 weeks, shaking it gently every few days to distribute the salt and juices.
9. After 3 weeks, the lemons will be preserved and ready to use.
