# Homemade Vinegar

## Description
This recipe provides a simple method for making homemade vinegar using white wine. The process involves fermenting the wine in a rundlet (a small barrel) and allowing it to sit in a warm place until it transforms into vinegar.

## Ingredients:
- White wine

## Instructions:
1. Choose a rundlet or a glass container with a wide opening that can hold the desired amount of white wine.
2. Pour the white wine into the rundlet, filling it completely.
3. Place the rundlet in a sunny spot or a warm place where it can remain undisturbed.
4. Leave the rundlet unstoppered to allow air to circulate and initiate the fermentation process.
5. Check the rundlet regularly to monitor the progress of the vinegar. It may take several weeks to several months for the wine to transform into vinegar, depending on the temperature and other factors.
6. Taste the vinegar occasionally to determine when it has reached the desired level of acidity. The longer it ferments, the stronger the vinegar will become.
7. Once the vinegar has reached the desired acidity, stop the fermentation process by stoppering the rundlet or transferring the vinegar to a sealed bottle.
8. Store the homemade vinegar in a cool, dark place to preserve its flavor.

## Cooking time
Several weeks to several months, depending on fermentation progress and desired acidity level.
