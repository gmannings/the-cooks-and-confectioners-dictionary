# Andobillets

## Description
Andobillets are a dish made from minced veal, bacon, sweet herbs, and the yolks of eggs. They are seasoned with pepper, salt, nutmeg, and beaten cinnamon to give them a fine color. The mixture is then shaped into small sausages and roasted on a spit, sandwiched between slices of bacon. They are basted with their own drippings, as well as a mixture of yolks of eggs and breadcrumbs, to create a crispy crust. Andobillets are served with mutton gravy, lemon juice, and fried parsley for garnish.

## Ingredients:
- 500g minced veal
- 200g bacon, finely chopped
- 2 tablespoons fresh herbs (such as parsley, thyme, and sage), finely chopped
- 2 egg yolks
- 1/2 teaspoon pepper
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 1/4 teaspoon nutmeg
- 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
- 8 slices of bacon
- 2 tablespoons breadcrumbs
- Mutton gravy
- Juice of 1 lemon
- Fried parsley, for garnish

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 180Â°C.
2. In a large bowl, combine the minced veal, chopped bacon, fresh herbs, egg yolks, pepper, salt, nutmeg, and cinnamon. Mix well until all the ingredients are evenly distributed.
3. Shape the mixture into small sausages, similar to chitterlings.
4. Take each sausage and wrap it with a slice of bacon, securing it with toothpicks if necessary.
5. Place the bacon-wrapped sausages on a roasting spit, making sure they are evenly spaced.
6. Roast the andobillets in the preheated oven for about 30-40 minutes, or until they are cooked through and the bacon is crispy.
7. While the andobillets are roasting, prepare the basting mixture. In a small bowl, combine the yolks of eggs and breadcrumbs.
8. After the andobillets have been roasting for about 15 minutes, start basting them with their own drippings. Then, switch to basting them with the yolk and breadcrumb mixture. Continue basting every 5-10 minutes until they are done.
9. Once the andobillets are cooked, remove them from the oven and let them rest for a few minutes.
10. Serve the andobillets with mutton gravy and a drizzle of lemon juice. Garnish with fried parsley.
