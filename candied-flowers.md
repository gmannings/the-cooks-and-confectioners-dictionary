# Candied Flowers

## Description
Candied flowers are a sweet treat made by coating fresh flowers in hardened sugar. They make a beautiful and delicate decoration for cakes, desserts, or even as a standalone treat.

## Ingredients:
- Fresh flowers (such as cowslips, gillyflowers, roses, violets, rosemary flowers, or arch-angel)
- Granulated sugar

## Instructions:
1. In a small saucepan, bring the granulated sugar to a boil over medium heat. Continue boiling until the sugar reaches the candy stage, which is around 300°F (150°C) on a candy thermometer. If you don't have a candy thermometer, you can test the sugar by dropping a small amount into a bowl of cold water. It should form hard threads that are brittle and break easily.
2. Once the sugar has reached the candy stage, carefully add the fresh flowers to the saucepan. Stir them gently with the back of a spoon to coat them evenly with the sugar syrup.
3. Keep stirring the flowers until you notice the sugar hardening on the spoon and the sides of the saucepan. This indicates that the flowers are coated with a thick layer of sugar.
4. Once the sugar has hardened on the flowers, remove them from the saucepan and place them on a sheet of parchment paper or a non-stick surface.
5. Allow the flowers to cool slightly, then gently rub them with your fingers to break up any lumps of hardened sugar and ensure an even coating.
6. Transfer the flowers to a fine-mesh sieve or colander and sift them to remove any excess sugar.
7. Place the flowers in a clean cloth and shake them gently up and down to remove any remaining sugar.
8. If you want the flowers to look as if they were freshly picked, carefully open the petals with your fingers while they are still slightly warm. Use a clean cloth to wipe off any excess sugar that may be clinging to the flowers.
