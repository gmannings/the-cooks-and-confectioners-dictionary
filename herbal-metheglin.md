# Herbal Metheglin

## Description
Herbal Metheglin is a traditional fermented honey beverage flavored with a variety of herbs and spices. It is a refreshing and aromatic drink that can be enjoyed on its own or used as a base for cocktails.

## Options and commentary
- You can use a combination of sage, basil, sweet marjoram, rosemary, and saffron for the herbs.
- If you don't have access to saffron, you can omit it or use a pinch of turmeric for color.
- Instead of using eggs to clarify the metheglin, you can use a fining agent like Irish moss or gelatin.
- If you don't have access to a canary cask, you can use a glass or ceramic container for fermentation.

## Ingredients:
- A handful of sage
- A handful of basil
- A handful of sweet marjoram
- A handful of rosemary
- A pinch of saffron or turmeric
- 1 gallon of water
- 1 cup of honey
- 20-30 egg whites (optional)
- 1 quart of ale yeast or 1 packet of wine yeast
- 1 quart of canary wine or 1 pint of aqua-vitae
- 2-3 peels of lemons and oranges
- 1/4 pound of sliced ginger in a bag

## Instructions:
1. In a large pot, bring the water to a boil.
2. Add the sage, basil, sweet marjoram, rosemary, and saffron to the boiling water.
3. Boil the herbs for 10 minutes to extract their flavors.
4. Remove the pot from the heat and let it sit overnight to allow the herbs to settle.
5. The next day, strain the liquid to remove the herbs.
6. Return the strained liquid to the pot and place it back on the heat.
7. Add the honey to the pot and stir until it dissolves completely.
8. If using, beat the egg whites until frothy and add them to the pot.
9. Bring the mixture to a boil and let it boil rapidly for 5 minutes.
10. Skim off any foam that rises to the surface.
11. Remove the pot from the heat and let the mixture cool to room temperature.
12. Once cooled, add the ale yeast or wine yeast to the pot and stir well.
13. Cover the pot with a clean cloth and let it ferment for about a week, stirring daily with a sanitized spoon or paddle.
14. After a week, the fermentation should slow down. Transfer the metheglin to a fermentation vessel, leaving behind any sediment.
15. Add the canary wine or aqua-vitae, lemon and orange peels, and sliced ginger in a bag to the fermentation vessel.
16. Seal the vessel and let the metheglin age for at least 2 months, preferably longer, in a cool and dark place.
17. Once the metheglin has aged to your liking, it is ready to be enjoyed. Serve chilled or use as a base for cocktails.
