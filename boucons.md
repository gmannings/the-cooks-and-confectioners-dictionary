# Boucons

## Description
Boucons are a dish made from thin slices of veal rolled up with bacon and ham, seasoned with herbs and spices, and then braised. The dish is flavorful and tender, with the combination of veal, bacon, and ham creating a rich and savory taste.

## Ingredients:
- Lean filet of veal
- Bacon, sliced into small pieces
- Raw ham, one fat and one lean
- Fresh parsley, chopped
- Fresh chives, chopped
- Spices (such as salt, pepper, and any other preferred spices)
- Sweet herbs (such as thyme, rosemary, or sage)

## Instructions:
1. Take the lean filet of veal and cut it into long and thin slices. Lay the slices on a table.
2. Place small pieces of bacon and slices of raw ham (one fat and one lean) on top of each slice of veal. The bacon and ham should be the same length as the slices of veal.
3. Sprinkle the slices of veal, bacon, and ham with chopped parsley and chives.
4. Season the slices with spices and sweet herbs. Use salt, pepper, and any other preferred spices. Add thyme, rosemary, or sage for sweet herbs.
5. Roll up the slices of veal and bacon tightly, creating neat rolls.
6. Place the rolled-up boucons in a braising pan or a deep skillet.
7. Add enough liquid (such as broth or wine) to partially cover the boucons.
8. Cover the pan with a lid and bring the liquid to a simmer over medium heat.
9. Reduce the heat to low and let the boucons simmer gently for about 1 to 1.5 hours, or until the veal is tender and cooked through.
10. Once the boucons are cooked, remove them from the pan and drain any excess fat.
11. Serve the boucons hot, either as a main dish or as part of a larger meal.

## Cooking time
