# Dange Cream

## Description
Dange Cream is a creamy and refreshing dessert made with oranges and eggs. It has a smooth and velvety texture, similar to a custard or pudding.

## Ingredients:
- 6 oranges
- 1.5 liters of water
- 6 egg yolks
- Sugar, to taste

## Instructions:
1. Grate the peels of the oranges into a pot or saucepan.
2. Add the water to the pot and bring it to a simmer over medium heat.
3. In a separate bowl, beat the egg yolks until well combined.
4. Slowly pour the beaten egg yolks into the simmering water, stirring constantly.
5. Sweeten the mixture with sugar to your desired taste.
6. Continue stirring the mixture in one direction until it thickens and reaches a creamy consistency, similar to cream. This may take about 10-15 minutes.
7. Once the mixture has thickened, remove it from the heat and strain it through a fine-mesh strainer to remove any lumps or orange zest.
8. Pour the strained mixture into individual serving glasses or bowls.
9. Allow the Dange Cream to cool to room temperature, then refrigerate for at least 2 hours to set.
10. Serve chilled and enjoy!
