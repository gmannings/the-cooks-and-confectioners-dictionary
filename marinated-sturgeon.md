# Marinated Sturgeon

## Description
This recipe is for marinating fresh sturgeon to preserve and enhance its flavor. The sturgeon is first fried until brown and crisp, then packed in trays and covered with a marinade or pickle made with white wine, white wine vinegar, salt, ginger, pepper, and mace. The marinated sturgeon can be served with its own pickle, spices, and slices of lemon.
