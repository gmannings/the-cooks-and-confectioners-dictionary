# Buttered Cauliflower

## Description
This recipe is for buttered cauliflower, a classic side dish that features tender cauliflower florets coated in a rich and flavorful butter sauce. The cauliflower is boiled until tender and then served with a creamy and tangy sauce made with butter, flour, salt, white pepper, nutmeg, vinegar, and slices of lemon.

## Ingredients:
- 1 head of cauliflower
- Water
- Salt
- 2-3 cloves
- 50g butter
- 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
- Salt, to taste
- White pepper, to taste
- Nutmeg, a pinch
- 1 tablespoon vinegar
- Slices of lemon

## Instructions:
1. Fill a large pot with water and add a generous amount of salt. Place the pot over high heat and bring the water to a boil.
2. While the water is heating, prepare the cauliflower by removing the leaves and cutting it into florets.
3. Once the water is boiling, add the cauliflower florets and the cloves to the pot. Boil the cauliflower over high heat until it is tender but still slightly crisp, about 5-7 minutes.
4. While the cauliflower is boiling, prepare the butter sauce. In a small saucepan, melt the butter over medium heat.
5. Add the flour to the melted butter and whisk until well combined. Cook the butter and flour mixture, stirring constantly, for about 1 minute to cook off the raw flour taste.
6. Gradually add the salt, white pepper, nutmeg, vinegar, and slices of lemon to the butter sauce, stirring well after each addition. Continue to cook the sauce, stirring constantly, until it thickens to a creamy consistency.
7. Once the cauliflower is cooked, remove it from the pot and drain it well.
8. Arrange the cauliflower florets in individual serving dishes or plates.
9. Pour the butter sauce over the cauliflower, making sure to coat each floret evenly.
10. Serve the buttered cauliflower immediately as a side dish.
