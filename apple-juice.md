# Apple Juice

## Description
This recipe provides instructions for making apple juice from fresh apples. It is recommended to use apples with a watery juice, such as Pippins, Pomewaters, Harvey-Apples, bitter Sweet-Apples, or other similar varieties. The juice is boiled and skimmed to remove impurities, then allowed to cool before being bottled.

## Ingredients:
- Fresh apples (Pippins, Pomewaters, Harvey-Apples, bitter Sweet-Apples, or other watery varieties)

## Instructions:
1. Wash the apples thoroughly to remove any dirt or debris.
2. Cut the apples into quarters, removing the cores and seeds.
3. Grind or stamp the apples to extract their juice. You can use a juicer or a food processor for this step.
4. Place a hair bag or cheesecloth over a large bowl or container.
5. Transfer the ground or stamped apples to the hair bag or cheesecloth.
6. Squeeze and press the apples to extract their juice. You can do this by twisting and squeezing the bag or cloth.
7. Discard the solids and collect the extracted juice in the bowl or container.
8. Pour the collected juice into a large pot or saucepan.
9. Place the pot or saucepan over medium heat and bring the juice to a boil.
10. As the juice boils, skim off any scum or impurities that rise to the surface. Use a spoon or a skimmer for this step.
11. Continue boiling the juice until it reaches the color of good small beer. This should take approximately 20-30 minutes.
12. Once the juice has reached the desired color, remove it from the heat and let it cool completely.
13. Once the juice has cooled, transfer it to a clean, sterilized bottle. Leave a small vent-hole to allow for any remaining gases to escape.
14. Let the juice stand undisturbed until it becomes clear and settles. This may take a few days to a week.
15. Once the juice has clarified, seal the bottle tightly with a cap or cork.
16. Store the bottled apple juice in a cool, dark place.
17. When ready to serve, chill the apple juice in the refrigerator and enjoy!

## Cooking time
Approximately 20-30 minutes boiling time, plus additional time for cooling, settling, and chilling.
