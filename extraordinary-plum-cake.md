# Extraordinary Plum Cake

## Description
This recipe is for a rich and flavorful plum cake made with a combination of flour, butter, currants, spices, sugar, eggs, yeast, cream, almonds, and candied citrus peel. The cake has a dense and moist texture with a burst of fruity flavors from the currants and citrus peel.

## Options and commentary
- You can use either all-purpose flour or cake flour for this recipe.
- If you prefer a lighter cake, you can substitute half of the butter with vegetable oil.
- Instead of using fresh yeast, you can use instant yeast. Use about 2 teaspoons of instant yeast.
- If you don't have cream, you can use whole milk instead.
- You can use either regular granulated sugar or brown sugar.
- If you don't have sack (a type of fortified wine), you can use sherry or brandy as a substitute.
- If you don't have orange flower water, you can omit it or use a small amount of orange zest.

## Ingredients:
- 2.25 kg flour
- 900 g butter
- 2.25 kg currants
- 1 large nutmeg, grated
- 18 g mace, finely grated
- 6 g cloves, finely grated
- 340 g sugar
- 12 eggs (9 whole eggs and 3 egg whites)
- 480 ml ale yeast
- 480 ml cream
- 340 g almonds
- 340 g candied citron
- 340 g candied orange peel
- 340 g candied lemon peel

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F).
2. In a large mixing bowl, combine the flour and butter. Use your hands or a pastry cutter to cut the butter into the flour until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs.
3. Add the currants, grated nutmeg, grated mace, and grated cloves to the bowl. Mix well to evenly distribute the spices and currants.
4. In a separate bowl, whisk together the sugar, eggs (leaving out 3 egg whites), and ale yeast until well combined.
5. Warm the cream in a small saucepan over low heat until it is just warm to the touch. Pour in a small amount of sack (or sherry/brandy) and mix well.
6. Gradually pour the cream mixture into the sugar and egg mixture, stirring constantly.
7. Add the almond paste to the bowl and mix well. The almond paste should be roughly crushed, not finely ground.
8. Stir in the candied citron, candied orange peel, and candied lemon peel until evenly distributed.
9. Grease a cake hoop or springform pan and line the bottom with a small amount of dough.
10. Pour the cake batter into the prepared pan and smooth the top with a spatula.
11. Bake in the preheated oven for approximately 2 hours, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.
12. Remove the cake from the oven and let it cool in the pan for 10 minutes. Then, transfer it to a wire rack to cool completely before serving.
