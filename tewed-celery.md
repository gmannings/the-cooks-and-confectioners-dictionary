# Tewed Celery

## Description
Tewed Celery is a dish made by boiling celery and then cooking it in a saucepan with butter, flour, bacon, cloves, mace, veal broth, salt, and pepper. It is then finished with a little drawn butter and served with toast or fried bread.

## Ingredients:
- 4-6 celery stalks
- 2 tablespoons butter
- 1 tablespoon flour
- 1 slice of bacon
- 6 cloves
- 1 blade of mace
- 250ml veal broth
- Salt and pepper to taste
- 1 tablespoon drawn butter
- Toasted bread or fried bread for garnish

## Instructions:
1. Bring a pot of water to a boil and add the celery stalks. Boil the celery for about 5 minutes until it becomes tender.
2. Remove the celery from the boiling water and immediately transfer it to a bowl of cold water to stop the cooking process.
3. Drain the celery well and squeeze out any excess water using your hands.
4. In a saucepan, melt the butter over medium heat.
5. Add the flour to the melted butter and stir until well combined. Cook for about 1 minute to remove the raw flour taste.
6. Add the bacon slice, cloves, and mace to the saucepan. Stir to coat them with the butter and flour mixture.
7. Pour in the veal broth, enough to cover the celery.
8. Season with salt and pepper to taste.
9. Bring the mixture to a boil and then reduce the heat to low. Simmer for about 15-20 minutes until the broth has thickened and reduced to a creamy consistency.
10. Remove the bacon slice and mace from the saucepan.
11. Pour the drawn butter over the cooked celery and gently stir to combine.
12. Shake the saucepan to mix the ingredients together, creating a fricass√©e-like texture.
13. Transfer the tewed celery to a serving dish.
14. Garnish with toasted bread or fried bread slices, cut into approximately 3 inches long and 2 inches wide pieces.
