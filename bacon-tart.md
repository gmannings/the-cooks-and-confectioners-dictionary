# Bacon Tart

## Description
A savory tart made with melted bacon, artichokes, macaroons, and eggs, seasoned with salt, pepper, cinnamon, and sugar. The tart is baked until golden and then glazed with a sweet icing made of sugar and orange flower-water.

## Options and commentary
- You can use any type of bacon you prefer, such as streaky bacon or back bacon.
- If you don't have artichokes, you can substitute with other vegetables like onions or mushrooms.
- Macaroons can be replaced with almond meal or crushed almonds for a similar texture and flavor.
- The icing can be made with powdered sugar and orange juice if you don't have orange flower-water.

## Ingredients:
- 450g bacon
- 2 artichokes
- 2 macaroons (or 50g almond meal/crushed almonds)
- 2 raw egg yolks
- Salt
- Pepper
- 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon
- 1 tablespoon sugar
- 1 sheet of puff pastry
- 100g powdered sugar
- 1 tablespoon orange flower-water (or orange juice)

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 180Â°C.
2. In a frying pan, melt the bacon over medium heat until crispy.
3. Remove the bacon from the pan and strain it to remove excess fat.
4. Finely chop the bottoms of two or three artichokes.
5. Crush the macaroons into small pieces or use almond meal/crushed almonds.
6. In a bowl, combine the strained bacon, chopped artichokes, crushed macaroons, raw egg yolks, salt, pepper, cinnamon, and sugar. Mix well.
7. Place the mixture back into the frying pan and cook over medium heat, stirring constantly with a spoon, until the ingredients are well combined and heated through.
8. Roll out the puff pastry into a thin sheet and line a tart or pie pan with it.
9. Pour the bacon mixture onto the puff pastry.
10. Bake the tart in the preheated oven for about 30 minutes, or until the pastry is golden and the filling is set.
11. While the tart is baking, prepare the icing by mixing the powdered sugar and orange flower-water (or orange juice) until smooth.
12. Once the tart is baked, remove it from the oven and let it cool slightly.
13. Drizzle the icing over the top of the tart, spreading it evenly.
14. Allow the tart to cool completely before serving.
