# Dzel's Tarp au Court-Bouillon

## Description
This recipe is for a classic French dish called Tarp au Court-Bouillon, which is a poached carp served in a flavorful broth. The carp is first scalded and then cooked in a mixture of white wine, vinegar, butter, and aromatic spices. It is garnished with parsley and served as the first course of a meal.

## Ingredients:
- 1 carp (approximately 1 kg)
- Vinegar, for scalding
- Salt, for scalding
- 500 ml white wine
- 250 ml vinegar
- 50 g butter
- 1 tsp black pepper
- 1 onion, sliced
- 4 cloves
- 1 bay leaf
- Fresh parsley, for garnish

## Instructions:
1. Start by scalding the carp. Fill a large pot with water and bring it to a boil. Add enough vinegar and salt to the boiling water to create a scalding solution. Carefully place the carp in the boiling water and let it sit for a few seconds. Remove the carp from the water and set it aside.
2. In an earthen pan, place the scalded carp and pour scalding hot vinegar and salt over it. This will help remove any fishy odor.
3. In a large pot, combine the white wine, vinegar, butter, black pepper, sliced onion, cloves, and bay leaf. Bring the mixture to a boil.
4. Once the mixture is boiling, carefully add the carp to the pot. Reduce the heat to low and let the carp simmer in the court-bouillon for about 20 minutes, or until it is cooked through and tender.
5. While the carp is cooking, prepare a clean napkin for serving. Fold the napkin neatly and place it on a serving platter.
6. Once the carp is cooked, carefully remove it from the court-bouillon and place it on the prepared napkin. Garnish the carp with fresh parsley.
7. Serve the Tarp au Court-Bouillon as the first course of your meal, accompanied by the flavorful court-bouillon broth.
