# Boiled Chickens with White Sauce

## Description
This recipe is for boiled chickens served with a flavorful white sauce. The sauce can be prepared in two different ways, depending on the season. In the summer, the sauce is made with broth from boiling the chickens, claret wine, artichoke bottoms, ox-palate, salt, sweet herbs, and butter. In the winter, the sauce is made with white wine, verjuice, pine kernels, dates, sweet herbs, mace, and butter. The boiled chickens are then served with asparagus, hard lettuce, scalded gooseberries, slices of lemon, and various garnishes.

## Options and commentary
