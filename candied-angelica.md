# Candied Angelica

## Description
Candied Angelica is a sweet treat made from the stalks of the Angelica plant. The stalks are boiled until tender, then peeled and soaked in warm water to turn them green. They are then coated in a sugar syrup and dried. Candied Angelica can be enjoyed on its own as a candy or used as a decorative element in desserts.

## Ingredients:
- Stalks of Angelica
- Water
- Fine sugar
- Rosewater

## Instructions:
1. Fill a pot with water and bring it to a boil.
2. Add the stalks of Angelica to the boiling water and cook until they are tender. This may take around 15-20 minutes.
3. Remove the cooked Angelica stalks from the pot and let them cool slightly.
4. Peel the outer layer of the stalks using a knife or your fingers.
5. Fill another pot with warm water and place the peeled Angelica stalks in it. Make sure the water covers the stalks completely.
6. Place the pot over a gentle fire or low heat and let the Angelica stalks soak until they become very green. This may take around 1-2 hours.
7. Once the Angelica stalks have turned green, remove them from the water and lay them on a cloth to dry. Allow them to dry completely, which may take a few hours or overnight.
8. Weigh the dried Angelica stalks.
9. In a separate pot, combine an equal weight of fine sugar with a little rosewater. The amount of rosewater can vary depending on your preference for flavor.
10. Place the pot with the sugar and rosewater over medium heat and bring it to a boil. Stir occasionally to dissolve the sugar completely.
11. Continue boiling the sugar syrup until it reaches the candy height, which is around 300°F (150°C) on a candy thermometer. This may take around 10-15 minutes.
12. Once the sugar syrup has reached the candy height, carefully add the dried Angelica stalks to the pot.
13. Boil the Angelica stalks in the sugar syrup for a few minutes, stirring gently to coat them evenly.
14. Using a slotted spoon or tongs, remove the candied Angelica stalks from the sugar syrup and place them on a wire rack or parchment paper to dry.
15. Allow the candied Angelica stalks to dry completely before storing them in an airtight container.
