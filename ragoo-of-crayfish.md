# Ragoo of Crayfish

## Description
A rich and flavorful dish made with crayfish tails, mushrooms, and truffles, bound together with a savory crayfish sauce.

## Ingredients:
- 500g crayfish tails
- 50g butter
- 100g small mushrooms, sliced
- 50g truffles, sliced
- 500ml fish broth
- 200ml crayfish sauce (cullis of crayfish)

## Instructions:
1. Boil the crayfish in a large pot of salted water until cooked through. This should take about 5-7 minutes. Remove the crayfish from the pot and let them cool slightly.
2. Once the crayfish are cool enough to handle, remove the tails from the shells. Set the tails aside.
3. In a saucepan, melt the butter over medium heat. Add the sliced mushrooms and truffles and saut√© until they are tender and lightly browned.
4. Add the crayfish tails to the saucepan and stir to combine with the mushrooms and truffles.
5. Pour in the fish broth to moisten the ingredients. Allow the mixture to simmer for a few minutes to allow the flavors to meld together.
6. Skim off any excess fat that rises to the surface of the saucepan.
7. Stir in the crayfish sauce (cullis of crayfish) to bind the ragoo and give it a rich, creamy texture.
8. Continue to cook the ragoo for another 2-3 minutes, until it is heated through and the flavors have fully developed.
9. Serve the ragoo in plates or little dishes, garnished with fresh herbs if desired.

## Cooking time
Approximately 30 minutes.
