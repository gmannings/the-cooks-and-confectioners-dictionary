# Turnip-dzink

## Description
Turnip-dzink is a fermented turnip drink that was popular in the 18th century. It is made by mashing turnips and allowing them to ferment for a few days. The resulting drink is slightly sour and can be enjoyed as a refreshing beverage.

## Options and commentary
- This recipe can be adjusted to make a smaller or larger batch, depending on your needs.
- The fermentation process can take anywhere from 2 to 5 days, depending on the temperature and desired flavor.
- You can add spices or herbs to the turnip mash for additional flavor, such as ginger or cinnamon.

## Ingredients:
- 2 large turnips
- Water

## Instructions:
1. Peel and chop the turnips into small pieces.
2. Place the turnip pieces in a large bowl or pot.
3. Using a potato masher or fork, mash the turnips until they are well crushed.
4. Transfer the mashed turnips into a clean hair-bag or cheesecloth.
5. Squeeze the bag or cheesecloth tightly to extract as much juice as possible. Discard the solids.
6. Pour the turnip juice into a large container, such as an open tun or hogshead.
7. Cover the container with a cloth or boards to keep out dust.
8. Allow the turnip juice to stand for 1-2 days in a cool, dry place.
9. After the fermentation period, you will notice that the more solid parts have settled at the bottom of the container.
10. Carefully draw off the clear liquid from the top, leaving the sediment behind.
11. Transfer the clear liquid into the vessels you intend to store it in, leaving about an eighth of the vessel empty.
12. Place the vessels in a cellar or cool place.
13. Keep the bung open or cover the vessels with a loose cover to allow for evaporation of volatile particles.
14. Let the turnip-dzink ferment for an additional 2-5 days, depending on the desired flavor. The longer it ferments, the more sour it will become.
15. Once the desired fermentation is reached, close the vessels tightly and store them in a cool place.
16. Serve the turnip-dzink chilled.
