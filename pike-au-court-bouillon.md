# Pike au Court Bouillon

## Description
Pike au Court Bouillon is a classic French dish that features a pike fish cooked in a flavorful broth. The fish is first marinated in vinegar and salt, then simmered in a court bouillon, which is a seasoned broth made with aromatic vegetables and herbs. This dish is light, delicate, and perfect for seafood lovers.

## Ingredients:
- 1 pike fish (about 1 kg), cleaned and scaled
- 500 ml white wine vinegar
- 2 tablespoons salt
- 2 liters water
- 1 onion, sliced
- 2 carrots, sliced
- 2 celery stalks, sliced
- 2 bay leaves
- 1 sprig of thyme
- 1 sprig of parsley
- 10 whole black peppercorns

## Instructions:
1. In a large pan, place the cleaned pike fish. If desired, you can cut the fish into quarters for easier handling.
2. Sprinkle the boiling-hot vinegar with salt over the fish, ensuring that it is evenly coated. Let the fish marinate in the vinegar and salt mixture for about 30 minutes.
3. In the meantime, prepare the court bouillon. In a separate pot, combine the water, sliced onion, carrots, celery, bay leaves, thyme, parsley, and black peppercorns. Bring the mixture to a boil and let it simmer for about 20 minutes to allow the flavors to infuse.
4. Once the court bouillon is ready, strain it to remove the vegetables and herbs, leaving only the flavorful broth.
5. Carefully transfer the marinated pike fish into the pot with the court bouillon. Make sure the fish is fully submerged in the broth.
6. Bring the court bouillon back to a simmer and cook the fish for about 10-15 minutes, or until it is cooked through and flakes easily with a fork. The cooking time may vary depending on the size and thickness of the fish.
7. Once the fish is cooked, carefully remove it from the court bouillon and transfer it to a serving platter.
8. Serve the Pike au Court Bouillon hot, accompanied by some of the strained court bouillon as a sauce.
