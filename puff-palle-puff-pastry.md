# Puff-Palle (Puff Pastry)

## Description
Puff-Palle is a classic flaky pastry that is made by layering dough and butter. It is light, airy, and perfect for making sweet or savory pastries.

## Options and commentary
- You can use all-purpose flour for this recipe.
- Instead of beating the eggs to snow, you can beat them until light and frothy.
- You can use unsalted butter for rolling into the dough.

## Ingredients:
- 1 kg all-purpose flour
- 8 large eggs
- Cold water
- 1.5 kg unsalted butter, chilled

## Instructions:
1. In a large mixing bowl, combine the flour and beaten eggs. Mix until the eggs are fully incorporated into the flour.
2. Gradually add cold water to the mixture, a little at a time, until a dough forms. The dough should be firm but not too dry.
3. Divide the dough into four equal portions and shape each portion into a rectangle. Wrap each rectangle in plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes.
4. Take one portion of the dough out of the refrigerator and place it on a lightly floured surface. Roll it out into a large rectangle, about 1/4 inch thick.
5. Take one-third of the chilled butter and grate it evenly over the rolled-out dough.
6. Fold the dough into thirds, like a letter, to encase the butter. Press the edges to seal.
7. Rotate the dough 90 degrees and roll it out again into a large rectangle, about 1/4 inch thick.
8. Repeat steps 5-7 two more times, using one-third of the butter each time.
9. After the final rolling, fold the dough into thirds again and wrap it in plastic wrap. Refrigerate for at least 30 minutes.
10. Repeat steps 4-9 with the remaining three portions of dough and butter.
11. Once all the dough has been rolled and folded, refrigerate for at least 1 hour before using.
