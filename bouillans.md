# Bouillans

## Description
Bouillans are small individual meat pies that were commonly served as a side dish or used to garnish other dishes in the 18th century. They are made with a mixture of roasted capon or pullet breasts, marrow, bacon, and parboiled calf's udder, all seasoned and encased in a thin pastry crust.

## Ingredients:
- Breasts of roasted capons or pullets
- 1 piece of marrow (about the size of an egg)
- Bacon
- Calves udder, parboiled
- Fine pastry dough

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F).

2. Finely mince the roasted capon or pullet breasts, marrow, bacon, and parboiled calves udder.

3. Season the minced meat mixture with salt, pepper, and any other desired herbs or spices.

4. Roll out a piece of fine pastry dough very thin and line the bottom of a baking dish with it.

5. Lightly wet the pastry dough with water.

6. Place small heaps of the minced meat mixture on top of the pastry dough at convenient distances.

7. Cover the minced meat with another piece of pastry dough.

8. Close up each individual parcel by itself, ensuring that the filling is completely enclosed.

9. Using a suitable instrument, cut off each individual parcel and place the uppermost piece of pastry dough underneath, creating a sealed pie.

10. Repeat the process for the remaining parcels.

11. Place the pies in the preheated oven and bake for approximately 25-30 minutes, or until the pastry is golden brown and cooked through.

12. Remove the bouillans from the oven and serve hot.
