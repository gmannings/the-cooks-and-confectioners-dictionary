# Dzel's Larks in a Ragoo

## Description
This recipe is a modernized version of an 18th-century dish called "Dzel's Larks in a Ragoo." It features larks cooked in a rich sauce made with bacon, mushrooms, truffles, capons, and onions. The sauce is thickened with a mixture of egg, cream, and parsley, and finished with a squeeze of lemon juice. This dish is a flavorful and indulgent option for a special occasion or a fancy dinner.

## Ingredients:
- 4 larks
- 4 slices of bacon, diced
- 1 cup mushrooms, sliced
- 1/4 cup truffles, sliced (optional)
- 1 capon liver, finely chopped
- 1 onion, stuck with 4 cloves
- 1 cup beef or veal gravy
- 1 tablespoon flour
- 1 egg
- 1/4 cup cream
- 2 tablespoons fresh parsley, finely chopped
- Juice of 1 lemon
- Salt and pepper to taste

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F).

2. In a large stew-pan, cook the diced bacon over medium heat until crispy. Remove the bacon from the pan and set aside.

3. Add the larks to the stew-pan and brown them on all sides. Remove the larks from the pan and set aside.

4. In the same stew-pan, add the mushrooms, truffles (if using), capon liver, and onion stuck with cloves. Cook until the mushrooms are tender and the onions are translucent.

5. Sprinkle the flour over the mushroom mixture and stir well to coat. Cook for 1-2 minutes to cook off the raw flour taste.

6. Pour in the beef or veal gravy and stir to combine. Bring the mixture to a simmer.

7. In a separate bowl, whisk together the egg, cream, and parsley until well combined.

8. Slowly pour the egg and cream mixture into the stew-pan, stirring constantly. Continue to cook over low heat for 5 minutes, or until the sauce has thickened.

9. Remove any excess fat from the surface of the sauce.

10. Squeeze the juice of one lemon into the stew-pan and stir well to incorporate.

11. Return the larks and crispy bacon to the stew-pan. Gently stir to coat the larks with the sauce.

12. Transfer the stew-pan to the preheated oven and bake for 20-25 minutes, or until the larks are cooked through.

13. Serve the Dzel's Larks in a Ragoo hot, garnished with additional parsley if desired.
