# Boiled Chicken with Sorrel Sauce

## Description
This recipe is for boiled chicken served with a tangy sorrel sauce. The chicken is seasoned with salt and pepper, then grilled over a fire until cooked through. The sorrel sauce is made with a mixture of sorrel, shallot, thyme, parsley, and strong gravy. The dish is garnished with slices of lemon for added freshness.

## Options and commentary
- You can use bone-in or boneless chicken for this recipe, depending on your preference.
- If you don't have access to sorrel, you can substitute it with spinach or watercress for a similar tangy flavor.
- The sauce can be thickened with a roux (equal parts butter and flour) instead of burnt bread, if desired.
- Feel free to adjust the seasoning and herbs according to your taste.

## Ingredients:
- 2 well-fed chickens
- Salt and pepper
- 1 French roll, grated into breadcrumbs
- 1 handful of sorrel leaves
- 1 shallot, finely chopped
- 1 teaspoon thyme leaves
- 1 teaspoon parsley, chopped
- 1 pint strong gravy
- 1 slice of burnt bread, crumbled
- Slices of lemon, for garnish

## Instructions:
1. Preheat your grill or broiler.
2. Split the chickens down the back and season them generously with salt and pepper.
3. Place the chickens on the grill, with the insides facing down. Make sure the grill is positioned high enough from the fire to prevent burning.
4. Cook the chickens, turning them often and basting them with the juices, until they are cooked through and the skin is crispy. This should take about 30-40 minutes, depending on the size of the chickens.
5. While the chickens are grilling, prepare the sorrel sauce. Dip the sorrel leaves in scalding water to blanch them, then drain and set aside.
6. In a saucepan, combine the shallot, thyme, parsley, and strong gravy. Bring the mixture to a simmer over medium heat.
7. Add the crumbled burnt bread to the saucepan and stir until the sauce thickens slightly.
8. Arrange the blanched sorrel leaves in heaps on a serving platter.
9. Pour the sauce over the sorrel leaves, ensuring they are well coated.
10. Garnish the dish with slices of lemon.
11. Serve the grilled chickens alongside the sorrel sauce and enjoy!

## Cooking time
Approximately 30-40 minutes, depending on the size of the chickens.
