# Bisket Drops

## Description
Bisket Drops are small, sweet cookies made with sugar, eggs, flour, and seeds. They are baked until golden and crispy.

## Options and commentary
- You can use any type of seeds you prefer, such as poppy seeds or sesame seeds.
- The original recipe calls for "Sack" and "Canary," which are types of fortified wines. You can substitute these with a dry white wine or omit them altogether.
- The recipe suggests using a gentle oven, which would be around 150-160°C.

## Ingredients:
- 450g sugar
- 4 egg yolks
- 2 eggs
- 30ml dry white wine (optional)
- 450g all-purpose flour
- 1-2 tablespoons seeds (poppy seeds, sesame seeds, etc.)
- Butter, for greasing
- Extra sugar, for sprinkling

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 150-160°C.
2. In a mixing bowl, beat the sugar, egg yolks, eggs, and white wine (if using) until well combined.
3. Add the flour and seeds to the bowl and mix until a smooth batter forms.
4. Grease a baking sheet with butter and place a sheet of parchment paper on top.
5. Drop spoonfuls of the batter onto the parchment paper, leaving space between each drop.
6. Sprinkle the drops with extra sugar.
7. Place the baking sheet in the preheated oven and bake for about 15-20 minutes, or until the drops are golden and crispy.
8. Remove from the oven and let the bisket drops cool on a wire rack.
9. Once cooled, store in an airtight container.
