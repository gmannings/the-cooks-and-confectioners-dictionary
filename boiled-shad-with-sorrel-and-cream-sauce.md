# Boiled Shad with Sorrel and Cream Sauce

## Description
This recipe is for boiling a shad, a type of fish, and serving it with a flavorful sauce made with sorrel and cream. The fish is first prepared by scaling and cleaning it, then it is grilled until browned. The sauce is made with a combination of sorrel, cream, butter, and various herbs and spices. Alternatively, the shad can be served with a ragout of mushrooms or a brown sauce with capers.

## Options and commentary
- Instead of shad, you can use another type of white fish such as cod or haddock.
- If you don't have sorrel, you can substitute it with spinach or watercress for a similar tangy flavor.
- The sauce can be customized by adding other herbs and spices such as dill or tarragon.
- If you prefer a vegetarian option, you can replace the fish with grilled tofu or tempeh and use vegetable broth instead of fish broth in the sauce.

## Ingredients:
- 1 shad (or other white fish)
- Butter, for rubbing
- Salt
- Pepper
- 1 cup sorrel leaves, chopped
- 1 cup cream
- Nutmeg, to taste
- Parsley, chopped
- Chervil, chopped
- Chives, chopped
- Optional: mushrooms for ragout
- Optional: capers for brown sauce

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the grill or broiler.
2. Scale and clean the shad, removing the head and tail if desired.
3. Score the fish on the side with shallow cuts.
4. Rub the fish all over with butter and sprinkle with salt.
5. Place the shad on a grill or broiler pan and cook over a gentle fire or under the broiler until browned on both sides. This should take about 10-15 minutes per side, depending on the thickness of the fish. 
6. While the fish is cooking, prepare the sauce. In a saucepan, combine the sorrel, cream, butter, nutmeg, parsley, chervil, and chives. Season with salt and pepper to taste.
7. If making a ragout of mushrooms, saut√© the mushrooms in butter until tender and set aside.
8. If making a brown sauce with capers, melt butter in a saucepan and add capers. Cook for a few minutes until heated through.
9. Once the fish is cooked, remove it from the grill or broiler and transfer to a serving platter.
10. Pour the sorrel and cream sauce over the fish, or serve the fish with the mushroom ragout or brown sauce with capers on the side.
11. Serve hot and enjoy!
