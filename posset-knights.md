# Posset Knights

## Description
Posset Knights are a type of sweet dish made with bread soaked in a mixture of cream or water, eggs, sugar, and nutmeg. The soaked bread is then fried in butter until golden and crispy. They are traditionally served with a topping of butter, sugar, and rosewater.

## Ingredients:
- 2 slices of bread
- 1/2 pint (250 ml) of cream or water
- 3 eggs
- 1 tablespoon of sugar
- 1/4 teaspoon of grated nutmeg
- Butter, for frying
- Butter, sugar, and rosewater, for serving

## Instructions:
1. Cut the bread slices into round slices.
2. In a shallow dish, pour the cream or water and dip the bread slices into it, ensuring they are well soaked. 
3. Arrange the soaked bread slices in a dish, spreading them out evenly.
4. In a separate bowl, beat the eggs together with the sugar and grated nutmeg.
5. Melt a knob of butter in a frying pan over medium heat.
6. Wet one side of the soaked bread slices with the egg mixture and place them in the frying pan with the wet side facing downwards.
7. Pour the remaining egg mixture over the bread slices in the frying pan.
8. Fry the bread slices until they are golden and crispy on both sides, flipping them halfway through cooking.
9. Once cooked, remove the Posset Knights from the frying pan and place them on a serving plate.
10. Serve the Posset Knights with a topping of butter, sugar, and a sprinkle of rosewater.
