# Roasted Eel with Herb Stuffing

## Description
This recipe is for roasting a large eel with a flavorful herb stuffing. The eel is first cleaned and prepared, then stuffed with a mixture of parsley, thyme, winter savory, sweet marjoram, and anchovy. It is then roasted slowly until the skin is crispy and basted with a mixture of water, salt, and butter. The dish is served with a sauce made from melted butter, white wine, and dissolved anchovies.

## Ingredients:
- 1 large eel
- Water
- Salt
- Butter
- Fresh parsley
- Fresh thyme
- Fresh winter savory
- Fresh sweet marjoram
- 1 anchovy
- White wine

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 180Â°C.
2. Wash the eel in water and salt to remove any impurities.
3. Cut off the head of the eel and remove the skin from a little below the vent.
4. Gut the eel and wipe it clean with a cloth.
5. Make three or four shallow cuts with a knife along the body of the eel.
6. Finely chop the parsley, thyme, winter savory, sweet marjoram, and anchovy.
7. Mix the chopped herbs and anchovy with salt and butter to form a stuffing.
8. Stuff the eel with the herb mixture, placing some inside the belly and in the cuts.
9. Pull the skin back over the eel and tie it with a piece of kitchen twine to keep the moisture inside.
10. Secure the eel to a spit or roasting rack.
11. Roast the eel in the preheated oven for about 45 minutes to 1 hour, or until the skin is crispy and the flesh is cooked through.
12. While roasting, baste the eel with a mixture of water and salt until the skin starts to break, then switch to basting with butter.
13. In a small saucepan, melt some butter and add white wine.
14. Dissolve three or four anchovies in the butter and wine mixture.
15. Cook the sauce over low heat until the anchovies are fully dissolved and the flavors are well combined.
16. Serve the roasted eel with the sauce on the side.
