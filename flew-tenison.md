# Flew Tenison

## Description
Flew Tenison is a dish made with sliced venison cooked in a flavorful sauce. The venison is stewed with red wine, herbs, spices, vinegar, sugar, and breadcrumbs. It is then finished with a sprinkle of nutmeg. This dish has a rich and savory flavor with a hint of sweetness and a touch of warmth from the spices.

## Ingredients:
- 500 grams venison, sliced
- 200 ml red wine (Claret)
- 2 sprigs of rosemary
- 6 cloves
- 1 tablespoon vinegar
- 1 tablespoon sugar
- 2 tablespoons grated bread (breadcrumbs)
- 1/4 teaspoon grated nutmeg

## Instructions:
1. In a stewpan, combine the sliced venison, red wine, rosemary sprigs, cloves, vinegar, sugar, and grated bread.
2. Place the stewpan over medium heat and bring the mixture to a simmer.
3. Reduce the heat to low and let the venison stew for about 1 hour, or until it becomes tender.
4. Stir occasionally to prevent sticking and to ensure even cooking.
5. After the venison has stewed for some time, grate in the nutmeg and stir to incorporate.
6. Continue to cook for an additional 5 minutes to allow the flavors to meld together.
7. Remove the rosemary sprigs and cloves from the stew.
8. Serve the Flew Tenison hot, garnished with a sprig of fresh rosemary, if desired.
