# Fried Eels

## Description
This recipe is for frying eels. The eels are first cleaned, boned, and cut into pieces. They are then marinated in a mixture of vinegar, salt, pepper, sliced onion, bay leaves, and lemon slices. After marinating, the eels are coated in flour and fried in clarified butter. The dish is served dry with fried parsley.

- Salt, to taste
- Pepper, to taste
- 1 onion, sliced
- 2 bay leaves

## Instructions:
1. Strip the eels, clean them, and bone them. Cut the eels into pieces.
