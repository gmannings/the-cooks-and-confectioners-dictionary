# Bisque

## Description
Bisque is a rich and flavorful soup made from fish. In this recipe, we will be using carp as the main ingredient. The fish is cooked and then blended with mushrooms, fish broth, butter, salt, pepper, and herbs to create a creamy and savory soup. The dish is garnished with a ragout made from the milt of carps, livers of pikes, and tails and claws of crayfish. The soup is served warm and is perfect for a special occasion or a comforting meal.

## Ingredients:
- 1 large carp
- 200g mushrooms, blanched and chopped
- 500ml fish broth
- 50g butter
- Salt and pepper to taste
- Fresh herbs (such as parsley, thyme, and dill), chopped
- 4 slices of bread, dried in the oven
- 200g milt of carps
- 100g livers of pikes
- Tails and claws of crayfish

## Instructions:
1. Scale and gut the carp. Remove all the flesh from the fish and pick out any bones. Set aside.
2. In a stewpan, combine the chopped carp flesh, blanched mushrooms, fish broth, butter, salt, pepper, and fresh herbs.
3. Cook the mixture over low heat, stirring occasionally, for about 30 minutes or until the fish is cooked and the flavors have melded together.
4. In a separate pan, prepare the ragout. Combine the milt of carps, livers of pikes, and tails and claws of crayfish. Cook them until they are tender and well-cooked.
5. In a serving dish, place the dried bread slices and soak them in some of the fish broth prepared earlier.
6. Once the soup is simmered enough, blend it using an immersion blender or a regular blender until smooth and creamy.
7. To serve, garnish the soup with the prepared ragout and serve it warm.
