# Roasted Larks

## Description
This recipe is for roasting larks, a small bird commonly found in the 18th century. The larks are trussed and larded with small strips of bacon. They are then roasted until cooked through and seasoned with salt and breadcrumbs. The dish can be served with a sauce made from verjuice (a sour juice made from unripe grapes), orange juice, and spices, or with a sauce made from claret (red wine), orange juice, ginger, and butter. Alternatively, the larks can be broiled and served with the same sauce.

## Options and commentary
- Instead of larks, you can use small game birds such as quail or Cornish hens.
- If you prefer a milder flavor, you can omit the ginger from the sauce.
- The cooking time will vary depending on the size of the birds and the desired level of doneness.

## Ingredients:
- Larks (or small game birds)
- Small strips of bacon (for larding)
- Salt
- Fine breadcrumbs
- Verjuice or orange juice
- Shalot (for rubbing the dish)
- Pepper
- Claret (red wine) (optional)
- Ginger (optional)
- Butter (optional)

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 180째C (350째F).
2. Truss the larks by tying their legs together with kitchen twine. Do not draw them or cut off their feet.
3. Lard the larks by inserting small strips of bacon into the meat.
4. If using a wooden skewer, split the larks and place a small strip of bacon between the halves. Secure the larks with the skewer.
5. Place the larks on a roasting rack in a roasting pan.
6. Roast the larks in the preheated oven for about 20-25 minutes, or until cooked through. The internal temperature should reach 74째C (165째F).
7. While the larks are roasting, prepare the sauce. For the verjuice and orange juice sauce, mix together verjuice, orange juice, salt, and pepper in a saucepan. Heat the sauce over low heat until warmed through.
8. For the claret and orange juice sauce, combine claret, orange juice, shredded ginger, and a small piece of butter in a saucepan. Heat the sauce over low heat for a few minutes, stirring occasionally, until the butter is melted and the flavors are combined.
9. Once the larks are cooked, remove them from the oven and sprinkle them with salt and fine breadcrumbs.
10. Rub the serving dish with a shalot to add flavor.
11. Place the larks on the prepared serving dish and pour the desired sauce over them.
12. Serve the roasted larks with additional salt, pepper, and the juice of an orange if desired.

## Cooking time
Approximately 20-25 minutes (may vary depending on the size of the birds)
