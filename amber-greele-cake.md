# Amber Greele Cake

## Description
Amber Greele Cake is a rich and fragrant cake made with a combination of flour, marmalade of quinces, sugar, rose water, yeast, currants, spices, candy orange peel, milk, eggs, ambergrease, and white wine. The cake is then topped with a sweet icing made with sugar, rose water, and egg white.

## Ingredients:
- 500g fine flour
- 100g marmalade of quinces
- 100g fine sugar
- 10 tablespoons rose water
- 125ml yeast
- 250g currants
- 14g cinnamon, finely powdered
- 14g mace, finely powdered
- 50g candy orange peel, cut very small
- 1 liter milk
- 10 eggs
- 1 dram (3.7g) ambergrease
- 60ml white wine
- 200g sugar (for icing)
- 2 tablespoons rose water (for icing)
- 1 egg white (for icing)

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 180Â°C.
2. In a large mixing bowl, combine the fine flour, marmalade of quinces, fine sugar, and 10 tablespoons of rose water. Mix well.
3. Add the yeast to the mixture and stir until well combined.
4. Add the currants, cinnamon, mace, and candy orange peel to the mixture. Mix well.
5. In a separate bowl, whisk together the milk and eggs. Gradually add this mixture to the flour mixture, stirring continuously until well combined.
6. In a small saucepan, dissolve the ambergrease in the white wine over low heat. Once dissolved, add it to the rest of the ingredients and mix well.
7. Grease a cake pan and pour the batter into it, spreading it evenly.
8. Bake the cake in the preheated oven for approximately 1 hour, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.
9. While the cake is baking, prepare the icing by melting the sugar in rose water over low heat. Once melted, remove from heat and let it cool slightly. In a separate bowl, whisk the egg white until frothy. Gradually add the sugar mixture to the egg white, whisking continuously until the icing thickens.
10. Once the cake is baked, remove it from the oven and let it cool completely.
11. Once the cake has cooled, spread the icing over the top of the cake, ensuring it is evenly coated.
12. Allow the icing to set before serving.
