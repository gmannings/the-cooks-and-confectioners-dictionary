# Roasted Leveret with Herb Sauce

## Description
This recipe is for roasting a leveret, which is a young hare. The leveret is prepared by not cutting off its ears or hind legs, but instead tying one leg through the other and cutting a hole in one ear to contain the other. The leveret is then roasted. While it is roasting, a sauce is made using the liver, bacon, beef suet, strong broth, vinegar, thyme, parsley, sweet marjoram, winter savory, and the yolks of hard-boiled eggs. The sauce is thickened with drawn butter and flavored with sugar and grated nutmeg. The leveret is served on a dish with the sauce and slices of lemon.

## Options and commentary
- If leveret is not available, you can substitute it with a young rabbit or even a chicken.
- Adjust the amount of herbs and spices in the sauce according to your taste preferences.
- Serve the roasted leveret with roasted vegetables or a side salad for a complete meal.
