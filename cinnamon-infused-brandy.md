# Cinnamon-infused Brandy

## Description
This recipe is for making a cinnamon-infused brandy. It involves infusing cinnamon in brandy for a few days, distilling the mixture, and then sweetening it with sugar. The end result is a flavorful and aromatic cinnamon brandy that can be enjoyed on its own or used in cocktails.

## Ingredients:
- 1 pound (454 grams) of cinnamon sticks
- 1 gallon (3.8 liters) of good quality brandy
- 1 quart (946 milliliters) of cold distilled plantain water
- 1 pint (473 milliliters) of the smallest distillate obtained from the brandy and cinnamon infusion
- 1 1/4 pounds (567 grams) of double-refined sugar

## Instructions:
1. In a large container, combine the cinnamon sticks and brandy. Bruise the cinnamon sticks by gently crushing them with a mortar and pestle or the back of a spoon.
2. Cover the container and let the cinnamon infuse in the brandy for three to four days. Make sure to store it in a cool, dark place.
3. After the infusion period, prepare an alembic or a distillation apparatus. Place the quart of cold distilled plantain water into the alembic along with the infused brandy and cinnamon mixture.
4. Begin the distillation process, following the instructions for your specific distillation apparatus. Distill until you have obtained nearly the same amount of liquid as you initially put in.
5. Take a pint of the smallest distillate obtained from the distillation process and transfer it to a saucepan.
6. Add the 1 1/4 pounds of double-refined sugar to the saucepan with the distillate.
7. Heat the saucepan over low heat, stirring constantly, until the sugar has completely dissolved and the mixture has thickened slightly. This will create a sweet syrup.
8. Remove the saucepan from heat and let the syrup cool completely.
9. Once the syrup has cooled, combine it with the remaining distillate from the distillation process.
10. Transfer the cinnamon-infused brandy mixture to bottles for storage and future use.
11. Seal the bottles tightly and store them in a cool, dark place.
12. The cinnamon-infused brandy is now ready to be enjoyed. It can be served on its own, used as a flavorful addition to cocktails, or incorporated into various recipes.
