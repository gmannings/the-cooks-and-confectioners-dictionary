# Umble-Pye of a Lamb's Head

## Description
Umble-Pye is a traditional English dish made with the minced meat of a lamb's head, along with other ingredients, baked in the form of a pie. It is a savory dish with a rich and flavorful filling.

## Options and commentary
- You can use lamb's head for a more authentic flavor, but if it's not available, you can substitute it with lamb shoulder or leg meat.
- If you prefer a milder flavor, you can reduce the amount of pepper and nutmeg.
- You can add additional vegetables like onions or carrots for added flavor and texture.

## Ingredients:
- 1 lamb's head (or 500g lamb shoulder or leg meat)
- 200g beef suet (or vegetable shortening for a vegetarian version)
- Salt, to taste
- Pepper, to taste
- Nutmeg, to taste
- Fresh herbs (such as parsley, thyme, or rosemary), finely chopped
- 50g currants
- Pie crust (store-bought or homemade)

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F).

2. If using a lamb's head, place it in a large pot of water and bring it to a boil. Cook until the meat is tender and easily comes off the bones. This may take about 2-3 hours. If using lamb shoulder or leg meat, skip this step.

3. Once the lamb's head is cooked, remove it from the pot and let it cool slightly. Pick the meat off the bones and finely mince it. If using lamb shoulder or leg meat, finely mince the meat.

4. In a mixing bowl, combine the minced lamb meat with the beef suet (or vegetable shortening). Mix well.

5. Season the mixture with salt, pepper, nutmeg, and the chopped fresh herbs. Adjust the seasoning according to your taste.

6. Add the currants to the mixture and mix until well combined.

7. Roll out the pie crust and line a pie dish with it. Trim off any excess crust.

8. Fill the pie crust with the lamb mixture, spreading it evenly.

9. Roll out another piece of pie crust and cover the filling. Seal the edges of the pie by crimping them together.

10. Make a few small slits on the top crust to allow steam to escape during baking.

11. Place the pie in the preheated oven and bake for about 45-50 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown and the filling is cooked through.

12. Remove the pie from the oven and let it cool slightly before serving.

## Cooking time
Approximately 2-3 hours for boiling the lamb's head (if using), plus 45-50 minutes for baking the pie.
