# Puff-Palle

## Description
Puff-Palle is a type of pastry made with a flaky, buttery dough. It is traditionally used for pan-pies that are served as a main course without any sweet desserts or treats.

## Ingredients:
- 500g all-purpose flour
- 350g unsalted butter, chilled and cubed
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 1 egg yolk
- Water, as needed

## Instructions:
1. In a large mixing bowl, combine the flour and salt.
2. Add the chilled butter cubes to the flour mixture and use your fingertips or a pastry cutter to cut the butter into the flour until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs.
3. In a small bowl, whisk together the egg yolk and a splash of water.
4. Make a well in the center of the flour mixture and pour in the egg yolk mixture.
5. Gradually incorporate the flour mixture into the egg yolk mixture, adding more water as needed, until a pliable dough forms. Be careful not to overmix.
6. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead it gently for a few minutes until it becomes smooth and elastic.
7. Shape the dough into a rectangle and wrap it in plastic wrap. Refrigerate for at least 30 minutes to allow the dough to rest and firm up.
8. Remove the dough from the refrigerator and place it on a lightly floured surface.
9. Roll out the dough into a long rectangle, about 1/4 inch thick.
10. Spread a layer of chilled butter evenly over the surface of the dough.
11. Fold the dough in thirds, like a letter, so that the butter is enclosed in the middle.
12. Rotate the dough 90 degrees and roll it out again into a long rectangle.
13. Repeat steps 10-12 for a total of five or six times, alternating between rolling and folding the dough.
14. After the final fold, wrap the dough in plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes before using.
