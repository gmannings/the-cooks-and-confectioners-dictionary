# Water of Betony Flowers

## Description
Water of Betony Flowers is a fragrant and refreshing herbal infusion made from betony flowers. It was commonly used in the 18th century for its medicinal properties and as a flavoring agent. This recipe involves infusing betony flowers in white wine or water for a couple of days and then distilling them using a water bath.

## Ingredients:
- Betony flowers
- White wine or water

## Instructions:
1. Take a handful of fresh betony flowers.
2. Sprinkle the flowers with white wine or water to moisten them.
3. Place the moistened flowers in a clean glass jar or container.
4. Seal the jar or container tightly and let it sit for two days to allow the flowers to infuse.
5. After two days, prepare a water bath by filling a large pot with water and placing a smaller pot or heat-resistant container inside it.
6. Place the jar with the infused flowers in the smaller pot or container.
7. Heat the water bath on the stove over low heat, making sure the water does not boil.
8. Allow the water bath to simmer gently for several hours, ensuring that the jar remains sealed.
9. As the water bath simmers, the steam will rise and condense on the lid of the jar, collecting the distilled water of betony flowers.
10. After several hours, carefully remove the jar from the water bath and let it cool.
11. Once cooled, strain the liquid through a fine mesh sieve or cheesecloth to remove any impurities or flower remnants.
12. Transfer the strained water of betony flowers to a clean bottle or container for storage.
13. Store the water of betony flowers in a cool, dark place until ready to use.

## Cooking time
Several hours for the water bath simmering process.
