# Conserve of Cherries

## Description
This recipe is for making a sweet and fruity conserve of cherries. The cherries are scalded, dried, and then combined with sugar to create a thick and flavorful preserve. The conserve can be poured into molds and chilled to create a delightful dessert.

## Ingredients:
- 500g cherries, pitted
- 500g sugar

## Instructions:
1. Place the pitted cherries in a pot of boiling water and blanch them for 1 minute.
2. Remove the cherries from the boiling water and drain them well.
3. Spread the cherries out on a clean kitchen towel and pat them dry.
4. In a separate pot, heat the sugar over medium heat until it reaches the "blown" stage. This is when the sugar has reached a temperature of 121°C (250°F) and forms a soft ball when dropped into cold water.
5. Add the dried cherries to the pot of hot sugar and stir well to coat the cherries evenly.
6. Continue stirring the mixture until an ice-like crust forms on the top.
7. Pour the conserve into individual molds or a large mold.
8. Allow the conserve to cool and set in the molds.
9. Once set, remove the conserve from the molds and serve.
