# Borage and Bugloss Ale

## Description
Borage and Bugloss Ale is a traditional 18th-century beverage made with herbs, honey, and spices. It is a fermented drink that is similar to modern-day beer or mead. The ale has a unique flavor profile with hints of herbs and spices, and it can be enjoyed as a refreshing drink.

## Ingredients:
- 3 gallons (11.4 liters) of water
- 1 bunch of baum (a type of herb)
- 1 lemon, sliced
- 1 sprig of thyme
- 1 sprig of sweet marjoram
- 1 sprig of rosemary
- 5-6 handfuls of borage leaves
- 5-6 handfuls of bugloss leaves
- 3 pounds (1.4 kilograms) of honey
- 30 cloves
- 2 ounces (56 grams) of nutmeg
- 6 ounces (170 grams) of ginger
- 1 1/2 pints (710 milliliters) of ale yeast
- Sugar (for bottling)

## Instructions:
1. In a large pot, bring the water to a boil.
2. Add the baum, lemon slices, thyme, sweet marjoram, and rosemary to the boiling water. Let them boil for about 10 minutes to infuse the flavors.
3. Add the borage leaves and bugloss leaves to the pot. Boil for another 5 minutes.
4. Remove the pot from the heat and strain the liquid to remove the herbs and lemon slices. Set the liquid aside to cool and settle overnight.
5. The next day, measure the settled liquid. For every gallon (3.8 liters) of liquid, add 3 pounds (1.4 kilograms) of honey.
6. Place the pot back on the heat and bring the liquid and honey mixture to a boil. Skim off any scum that rises to the surface.
7. In a small bag or cheesecloth, combine the cloves, nutmeg, and ginger. Tie the bag securely.
8. Add the bag of spices to the boiling liquid and let it simmer for a few minutes to infuse the flavors.
9. Remove the pot from the heat and transfer the liquid to a fermentation vessel.
10. Add 1 1/2 pints (710 milliliters) of ale yeast to the liquid and stir well.
11. Cover the vessel with a sheet and then wrap a blanket around it to maintain a warm temperature.
12. Allow the mixture to ferment for a sufficient amount of time, typically around 1-2 weeks, until it stops bubbling and becomes clear.
13. Once fermentation is complete, transfer the ale to a cask, leaving behind any sediment at the bottom.
14. Hang the bag of spices in the cask.
15. Seal the cask tightly and let it age for 6-7 weeks.
16. After aging, bottle the ale, adding some sugar to each bottle to carbonate it.
17. Store the bottles in a cool place for a few weeks to allow the carbonation to develop.
18. Serve chilled and enjoy!
