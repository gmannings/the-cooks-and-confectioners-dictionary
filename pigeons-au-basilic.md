# Pigeons au Basilic

## Description
Pigeons au Basilic is a classic 18th-century dish that features pigeons stuffed with a flavorful mixture of minced pigeon livers, bacon, herbs, and spices. The pigeons are then boiled in broth, coated in breadcrumbs and eggs, and fried until golden brown. The dish is garnished with fried parsley and served hot.

## Ingredients:
- 2 pigeons
- 2 slices of bacon
- 2 pigeon livers
- 1 tablespoon chopped chives
- 1 tablespoon chopped basil
- 1 tablespoon chopped parsley
- Salt and pepper to taste
- 2 cups chicken broth
- 1 tablespoon verjuice (or substitute with white wine vinegar)
- 1 onion
- 4 cloves
- 2 eggs
- Breadcrumbs
- Vegetable oil for frying
- Fresh parsley for garnish

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F).

2. Blanch the pigeons by placing them in a pot of scalding-hot water for a few seconds. This will help remove any impurities from the skin. Remove the pigeons from the water and pat them dry with paper towels.

3. Cut a small slit in the back of each pigeon to create an opening for the stuffing.

4. In a bowl, finely mince the pigeon livers and bacon together.

5. Add the chopped chives, basil, parsley, salt, and pepper to the minced livers and bacon. Mix well to combine.

6. Stuff each pigeon with the prepared mixture, making sure to fill the cavity evenly.

7. In a large pot, bring the chicken broth to a boil. Add the verjuice, onion, and cloves to the broth.

8. Carefully place the stuffed pigeons into the boiling broth. Reduce the heat to low and simmer for about 20 minutes, or until the pigeons are cooked through.

9. While the pigeons are cooking, beat the eggs in a shallow bowl. Place the breadcrumbs in another shallow bowl.

10. Once the pigeons are cooked, remove them from the broth and allow them to cool slightly.

11. Dip each pigeon into the beaten eggs, making sure to coat them completely. Then roll the pigeons in the breadcrumbs, pressing gently to ensure the breadcrumbs adhere.

12. Heat vegetable oil in a frying pan over medium heat. Fry the pigeons until they are golden brown on all sides, turning them carefully to ensure even browning. This should take about 5 minutes.

13. Once the pigeons are fried, transfer them to a paper towel-lined plate to drain any excess oil.

14. Place the fried pigeons on a serving platter and garnish with fried parsley.

15. Serve the Pigeons au Basilic hot as a main dish.
