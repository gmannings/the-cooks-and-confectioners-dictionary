# Boiled Cream Pudding

## Description
This recipe is for a boiled cream pudding, a traditional dessert from the 18th century. It is a creamy and sweet pudding made with cream, almonds, eggs, sugar, and bread. The pudding is boiled and then served with a butter sauce flavored with white wine and sugar.

## Options and commentary
- You can use either rose water, milk, or plain water to dip the cloth before boiling the pudding.
- The pudding can be served warm or chilled, depending on your preference.
- You can garnish the pudding with blanched almonds for added texture and flavor.

## Ingredients:
- 1 quart (950 ml) cream
- 1 cup (100 g) almonds
- 1/4 cup (60 ml) rose water
- 8 egg yolks
- 4 egg whites
- Sugar, to taste
- 1 cup (100 g) grated bread
- Flour, for dusting the cloth
- Butter, for serving
- 1/4 cup (60 ml) white wine

## Instructions:
1. In a large saucepan, bring the cream to a boil over medium heat. Reduce the heat to low and let it simmer gently for 5 minutes.
2. Meanwhile, grind the almonds in a food processor or mortar and pestle until finely ground. Add the rose water and mix well.
3. In a separate bowl, whisk together the egg yolks and egg whites until well combined.
4. Slowly pour the egg mixture into the simmering cream, stirring constantly to prevent curdling.
5. Add the almond mixture to the cream and eggs, stirring well to combine.
6. Sweeten the mixture with sugar to your desired taste.
7. Gradually add the grated bread to the mixture, stirring continuously until the pudding thickens.
8. Prepare a linen cloth by rubbing it with flour to prevent sticking.
9. Tie up the cloth securely and dip it in either rose water, milk, or plain water.
10. Place the cloth in a large pot of boiling water and let it cook for about 1 hour, or until the pudding is set and firm.
11. Carefully remove the cloth from the pot and unwrap the pudding onto a serving dish.
12. Garnish the pudding with blanched almonds, if desired.
13. In a small saucepan, melt the butter over low heat. Stir in the white wine and sugar to taste, until the sauce is smooth and well combined.
14. Serve the boiled cream pudding with the butter sauce on the side.
