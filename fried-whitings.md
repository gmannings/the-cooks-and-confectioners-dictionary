# Fried Whitings

## Description
Fried Whitings is a classic dish where fresh whiting fish is seasoned, coated in a thin batter, and fried until crispy. The result is a delicious and flavorful seafood dish that can be served as a main course or as part of a seafood platter.

## Ingredients:
- 4 fresh whiting fish
- Salt
- Pepper
- Vinegar
- Flour
- Oil for frying

## Instructions:
1. Slit the whiting fish down the back, removing the guts if necessary.
2. Season the fish with salt and pepper, ensuring both the inside and outside are seasoned.
3. Place the seasoned fish in a shallow dish and pour vinegar over them. Allow them to marinate in the vinegar for about 15 minutes.
4. In the meantime, prepare the batter by combining flour with a pinch of salt and pepper in a mixing bowl. Gradually add water while whisking until you have a thin batter consistency.
5. Heat oil in a deep frying pan or deep fryer to about 180°C (350°F).
6. Remove the fish from the vinegar and pat them dry with paper towels.
7. Dip each fish into the flour, ensuring they are evenly coated. Shake off any excess flour.
8. Dip the floured fish into the thin batter, making sure they are fully coated.
9. Carefully place the battered fish into the hot oil, one at a time, and fry until golden brown and crispy. This should take about 4-5 minutes per side, depending on the size of the fish.
10. Once cooked, remove the fish from the oil and place them on a plate lined with paper towels to drain any excess oil.
11. Serve the fried whitings hot with a side of tartar sauce or lemon wedges.
