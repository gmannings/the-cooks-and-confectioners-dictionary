# Barbadoes Water

## Description
Barbadoes Water is a citrus-based liqueur that can be made with either citrons, oranges, or lemons. It is a refreshing and aromatic drink that can be enjoyed on its own or used as an ingredient in cocktails.

## Options and commentary
- You can use either citrons, oranges, or lemons to make this Barbadoes Water. Citrons are the traditional choice, but oranges or lemons will work just as well.
- If you have access to orange or lemon flowers, adding them to the mixture will enhance the flavor and aroma of the Barbadoes Water.
- The recipe calls for a cold still to distill the citrus peels and the mixture of brandy and wine. If you don't have a still, you can use a double boiler setup to gently heat the mixture and extract the flavors.
- Allum is mentioned in the original recipe, but it is not clear what purpose it serves. It is recommended to omit this ingredient unless you have specific knowledge about its use.

## Ingredients:
- Citrons, oranges, or lemons (enough to yield the desired amount of juice and peel)
- Brandy (4 pounds)
- Madera wine (1 gallon)
- Sugar (1 pound)
- Egg whites (3)
- Water (3 pints)
- Citron flowers (optional)

## Instructions:
1. If using citrons, oranges, or lemons, wash them thoroughly.
2. Peel the citrus fruits very thinly, trying to avoid the bitter white pith as much as possible. If using citrons, dry the yellow peels in the sun until they are completely dry.
3. Grate the white part of the citrus peels until you reach the pulp or juice.
4. Place the grated citrus peel into a cold still (or a double boiler setup) and distill it with a quick fire to extract as much of the simple water as possible. Collect the distilled water in a separate container.
5. In a large container, combine the dried peels with the brandy and let them infuse for a period of time (e.g., a few days to a week).
6. Add the Madera wine to the container with the infused peels and brandy.
7. Distill the mixture of peels, brandy, and wine in a cold still (or double boiler setup) and collect the distillate.
8. Add two or three quarts of the previously distilled simple water to the collected distillate.
9. In a separate pot, combine the sugar and water, and add the egg whites. Stir well to dissolve the sugar.
10. Place the pot on the stove and bring the mixture to a boil. Continue boiling until the mixture reaches a syrup consistency.
11. Pass the syrup through a jelly bag or fine-mesh strainer to remove any impurities and achieve a clear and fine syrup.
12. Add two quarts of the syrup to the mixture of distilled waters, or adjust the amount according to your taste preferences.
13. Optionally, add a small piece of citron flower to the mixture for added aroma.
14. Once the mixture is clear and fine, transfer it to other bottles, leaving any sediment behind.
15. If desired, add additional citron flowers to the bottles for decoration and added aroma.

## Cooking time
- The overall cooking time will depend on the time needed for the citrus peels to dry, the infusion period for the brandy and peels, and the distillation process. These steps can take several days to a week.
- The boiling of the sugar and water mixture to make the syrup will take approximately 10-15 minutes.
- The final preparation and bottling of the Barbadoes Water should take about 30 minutes.
