# Veal Collops with Bacon and Farce

## Description
This recipe is for veal collops, which are thin slices of veal that are stuffed with a flavorful farce and wrapped in bacon. The collops are then cooked until browned and tender, and served with a rich gravy and additional garnishes like truffles, mushrooms, and sweetbreads. This dish is a delicious and elegant option for a special occasion or a fancy dinner.

## Ingredients:
- Thin slices of veal (approximately 500g)
- Bacon slices (approximately 8 slices)
- For the farce:
  - Ground pork or veal (approximately 250g)
  - Bread crumbs (approximately 50g)
  - Finely chopped herbs (such as parsley, thyme, and sage)
  - Salt and pepper to taste
  - Beaten eggs (approximately 2 eggs)
- For the gravy:
  - Beef or veal stock (approximately 500ml)
  - Truffles (optional)
  - Mushrooms (optional)
  - Sweetbreads (optional)
  - Bread crumbs (approximately 50g)
  - Flour for dusting
  - Salt and pepper to taste

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 180Â°C.
2. Cut thin slices of veal from a leg of veal. The slices should be approximately 1/4 inch thick.
3. Lard the veal slices by inserting small strips of bacon into the meat. Lay the larded veal slices on a dresser or cutting board, with a slice of bacon underneath each slice.
4. Prepare the farce by combining ground pork or veal, bread crumbs, finely chopped herbs, salt, and pepper in a bowl. Mix well.
5. Place a spoonful of the farce in the middle of each veal slice. Use your fingers to press the farce onto the veal, so it sticks and becomes incorporated with the meat. Ensure that the bacon is visible on all sides.
6. Dip your fingers in beaten egg and stroke the sides of each veal slice to help the collop stick together.
7. Heat a stewpan over medium heat and add a small amount of fat or oil. Place the veal collops in the stewpan and cover it with a lid. Cook the collops on both sides until they are browned.
8. Remove the collops from the stewpan and drain them from any excess fat. Dust them lightly with flour to help them brown further.
9. In the same stewpan, add the beef or veal stock, truffles, mushrooms, sweetbreads, and bread crumbs. Cook the mixture until it thickens slightly.
10. Return the veal collops to the stewpan and simmer them in the gravy for about 30 minutes, or until they are tender.
11. Sprinkle the collops with a little more gravy before serving.
12. Dish the veal collops and pour the kagoo (gravy) over them.
13. Serve the veal collops hot, garnished with additional truffles, mushrooms, or sweetbreads if desired.
