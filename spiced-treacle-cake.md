# Spiced Treacle Cake

## Description
This recipe is for a spiced treacle cake, which was a popular dessert in the 18th century. The cake is made with flour, treacle (a type of molasses), sugar, ginger, and a mix of candied orange and lemon peel. It is spiced with a combination of powdered ginger and other spices. The cake is baked until it is firm and golden.

## Ingredients:

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F).
2. In a large mixing bowl, combine the flour, treacle, sugar, powdered ginger, candied orange peel, and candied lemon peel. Mix well until all the ingredients are fully incorporated and the mixture is stiff.
3. Add the assorted spices to the mixture, according to your taste preferences. Start with a small amount and gradually add more until you achieve the desired level of spiciness.
