# Boiled Neats Tongue

## Description
This recipe is for boiling a neats tongue, which is a type of beef tongue. The tongue is first salted for a few days to enhance the flavor, then boiled until tender. It is traditionally served with a side of brewis (a type of bread pudding), boiled turnips and onions, and topped with melted butter. The dish can be garnished with barberries, gooseberries, or grapes, and served with a sauce of your choice.

## Ingredients:
- 1 neats tongue (beef tongue)
- Salt
- Water
- Brewis (bread pudding)
- Boiled turnips
- Boiled onions
- Butter
- Barberries, gooseberries, or grapes (for garnish)
- Sauce of your choice

## Instructions:
1. Place the neats tongue in a container and generously sprinkle salt all over it. Let it sit in the refrigerator for 3-4 days to allow the salt to penetrate and flavor the meat.
2. After the salting period, remove the tongue from the refrigerator and rinse off any excess salt.
3. Place the tongue in a large pot and cover it with enough water to fully submerge it.
4. Bring the water to a boil over high heat, then reduce the heat to low and let the tongue simmer gently.
5. Cook the tongue for approximately 2-3 hours, or until it becomes tender and easily pierced with a fork.
6. While the tongue is cooking, prepare the brewis, boiled turnips, and boiled onions according to your preferred recipes.
7. Once the tongue is cooked, remove it from the pot and let it cool slightly.
8. Peel off the tough outer skin of the tongue using a knife.
9. Slice the tongue into thin, even slices.
10. Arrange the sliced tongue on a serving platter.
11. Melt some butter and pour it over the sliced tongue.
12. Serve the boiled tongue with brewis, boiled turnips, and boiled onions on the side.
13. Garnish the dish with barberries, gooseberries, or grapes, if desired.
14. Serve the boiled tongue with a sauce of your choice, such as a mustard sauce, horseradish sauce, or gravy.

Approximately 2-3 hours for boiling the tongue. Additional time required for preparing the brewis, boiled turnips, and boiled onions.
