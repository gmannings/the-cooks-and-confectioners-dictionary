# Boiled Soles

## Description
Boiled Soles is a classic dish that features tender and flavorful sole fish cooked in a tangy and aromatic broth. The fish is served on toasted bread slices and garnished with citrus, berries, and a rich butter sauce. This dish is perfect for a light and elegant meal.

## Ingredients:
- 4 sole fillets
- 1 cup white vinegar
- 1 cup white wine
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 1/2 teaspoon ground mace
- 4 slices of bread
- 1 lemon, sliced
- 1/2 cup gooseberries, barberries, or grapes
- 1/2 cup butter
- Juice of 2 oranges
- 1 cup stewed oysters (optional)

## Instructions:
1. Start by preparing the sole fillets. Draw and skin the soles, then rinse them under cold water. Pat them dry with paper towels.
2. In a large pot, combine the white vinegar, white wine, salt, and ground mace. Bring the mixture to a boil over medium heat.
3. Once the liquid is boiling, carefully add the sole fillets to the pot. Allow the liquid to return to a boil, then reduce the heat to low and simmer for about 5 minutes, or until the fish is cooked through and opaque.
4. While the fish is cooking, prepare the garnishes. Toast the bread slices until golden brown. Set aside.
5. Arrange the sliced lemon, gooseberries (or barberries or grapes), and stewed oysters (if using) on a serving platter.
6. In a small saucepan, melt the butter over low heat. Once melted, remove from heat and whisk in the juice of the oranges until well combined.
7. Once the sole fillets are cooked, carefully remove them from the pot and place them on the toasted bread slices.
8. Pour the orange butter sauce over the fish and bread.
9. Transfer the fish and bread to the serving platter, arranging them on top of the garnishes.
10. Serve the boiled soles immediately, garnished with additional lemon slices if desired.
