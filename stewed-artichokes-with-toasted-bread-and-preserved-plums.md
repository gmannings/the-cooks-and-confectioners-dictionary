# Stewed Artichokes with Toasted Bread and Preserved Plums

## Description
This recipe is a modernized version of a dish from the 18th century. Stewed artichokes are cooked with toasted bread, marrow, mace, sugar, and preserved plums. The artichokes are tender and flavorful, and the dish is garnished with barberries for a touch of tartness. It is a unique and delicious side dish that can be served with a variety of main courses.

## Options and commentary
- Instead of using preserved plums, you can use fresh plums or other preserved fruits like apricots or cherries.
- If you don't have access to barberries, you can use cranberries or pomegranate seeds as a garnish.
- The marrow of two bones can be replaced with butter or olive oil for a vegetarian version of the dish.

## Ingredients:
- 4 artichokes
- 4 slices of bread
- 2 tablespoons marrow (or butter/olive oil)
- 5-6 blades of mace
- 2 ounces sugar
- 1/2 pound preserved plums (or fresh plums)
- Barberries, cranberries, or pomegranate seeds for garnish

## Instructions:
1. Fill a large pot with water and bring it to a boil.
2. Add the artichokes to the boiling water and cook them until they are tender. This usually takes about 20-30 minutes.
3. Once the artichokes are cooked, remove them from the pot and let them cool slightly.
4. Remove the leaves and choke from each artichoke. Cut the bottom into quarters and then slice them.
5. Preheat the oven to 350°F (180°C).
6. Place the slices of bread on a baking sheet and toast them in the oven until they are crispy. This usually takes about 10 minutes.
7. In a stewpan, melt the marrow (or butter/olive oil) over medium heat.
8. Add the mace blades, sugar, and preserved plums (or fresh plums) to the stewpan. Stir everything together.
9. Add the sliced artichokes to the stewpan and mix them with the other ingredients.
10. Cover the stewpan and let the artichokes stew together with the other ingredients for about 2 hours. Stir occasionally to prevent sticking.
11. Once the stewing time is up, remove the artichokes from the stewpan and transfer them to a serving dish.
12. Garnish the dish with barberries, cranberries, or pomegranate seeds.
13. Serve the stewed artichokes as a side dish with your main course.
