# Candied Walnuts

## Description
Candied walnuts are a sweet and crunchy treat that can be enjoyed on their own or used as a topping for desserts or salads.

## Ingredients:
- 500g walnuts
- 500g double-refined sugar
- 1 liter water
- Cloves
- Sugar (for boiling)

## Instructions:
1. In a large pot, bring water to a boil.
2. Add the walnuts to the boiling water and let them cook for a few minutes until they become tender. This may take about 4-5 minutes.
3. Drain the walnuts and repeat this process of boiling and draining four to five times. This helps to remove any bitterness from the walnuts.
4. While the walnuts are still hot, scrape off any remaining skin and stick a clove into each walnut.
5. In a separate pot, bring a good quantity of water to a boil and add a little sugar to it.
6. Place the walnuts in the boiling water and sugar mixture and let them steep in it overnight.
7. The next day, drain the walnuts and set them aside.
8. In a clean pot, combine the double-refined sugar and water. Use a pint of water for every pound of walnuts.
9. Bring the syrup to a boil and let it cook until it reaches the desired consistency. This may take some time, so be patient.
10. Once the syrup has thickened, remove it from the heat and add the walnuts back into the pot.
11. Allow the walnuts to soak in the syrup for at least a week, or even longer if desired. Make sure to check on them regularly to ensure they do not turn sour or the syrup does not thin out.

## Cooking time
- Boiling the walnuts: 4-5 minutes
- Steeping the walnuts overnight: 8-12 hours
- Boiling the syrup: until desired consistency is reached
- Soaking the walnuts in the syrup: at least 1 week
