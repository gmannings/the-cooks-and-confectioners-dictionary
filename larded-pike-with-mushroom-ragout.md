# Larded Pike with Mushroom Ragout

## Description
This recipe is a modernized version of an 18th-century dish called "Larded Pike with Mushroom Ragout." It features a whole pike fish that is larded with eel, cooked in clarified butter and verjuice, and seasoned with a variety of spices and herbs. The dish is then served with a flavorful mushroom ragout.

## Options and commentary
- Instead of larding the pike with eel, you can use bacon or pancetta as a modern alternative.
- Verjuice, which is a sour juice made from unripe grapes, can be substituted with a combination of lemon juice and white wine vinegar.
- The spices and herbs can be adjusted to personal taste.
- The mushroom ragout can be made with a variety of mushrooms, such as cremini, shiitake, or oyster mushrooms.

## Ingredients:
- 1 whole pike fish, scaled and gutted
- 100g eel or bacon, cut into thin strips
- 50g clarified butter
- 50ml verjuice (or 25ml lemon juice + 25ml white wine vinegar)
- Salt and pepper to taste
- 1/4 teaspoon ground cloves
- 1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg
- 1 bay leaf
- 1 sprig of basil
- 1 faggot of mixed fresh herbs (such as parsley, thyme, and rosemary)
- 2 slices of lemon
- 200g mushrooms, sliced
- 2 tablespoons butter
- 100ml fish broth
- 2 tablespoons cullis (thickened sauce)

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 180Â°C.
2. Using a sharp knife, make small incisions along the sides of the pike fish.
3. Insert the strips of eel or bacon into the incisions, evenly distributing them along the length of the fish.
4. In a large ovenproof skillet, heat the clarified butter over medium heat.
5. Place the larded pike fish in the skillet and cook for 2-3 minutes on each side until lightly browned.
6. Pour the verjuice (or lemon juice + white wine vinegar) over the fish.
7. Season the fish with salt, pepper, ground cloves, ground nutmeg, bay leaf, basil, and the faggot of mixed fresh herbs.
8. Place the slices of lemon on top of the fish.
9. Transfer the skillet to the preheated oven and bake for 20-25 minutes, or until the fish is cooked through and flakes easily with a fork.
10. While the fish is baking, prepare the mushroom ragout. In a separate skillet, melt the butter over medium heat.
11. Add the sliced mushrooms to the skillet and cook until they are tender and lightly browned.
12. Pour in the fish broth and simmer for a few minutes.
13. Stir in the cullis to thicken the sauce.
14. Remove the fish from the oven and transfer it to a serving dish.
