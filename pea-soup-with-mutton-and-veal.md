# Pea Soup with Mutton and Veal

## Description
This recipe is for a hearty and flavorful pea soup made with mutton, veal, and a variety of herbs. The peas are boiled until soft and thickened, then combined with the meat broth and seasoned with mint, thyme, and bacon. The soup is served with crispy fried bacon and a generous amount of butter.

## Options and commentary
- You can use either fresh or dried peas for this recipe. If using dried peas, make sure to soak them overnight before cooking.
- Feel free to adjust the amount of mint and thyme according to your taste preferences.
- If you prefer a vegetarian version, you can omit the mutton and veal and use vegetable broth instead.

## Ingredients:
- 4 quarts (3.8 liters) of peas, hulled
- 1 leg of mutton
- 2-3 pieces of veal humbles (sweetbreads)
- Water, enough to cover the meat
- A handful of fresh mint leaves
- A few sprigs of fresh thyme
- 1 piece of bacon
- Salt and pepper, to taste
- Crispy fried bacon, for garnish
- Butter, for serving

## Instructions:
1. In a large pot, bring the hulled peas and enough water to cover them to a boil. Cook until the peas are soft and thickened. This may take about 1-2 hours for dried peas or 30-45 minutes for fresh peas. Stir occasionally to prevent sticking.
2. In another pot, place the leg of mutton and veal humbles. Prick them with a knife to release the gravy. Add enough water to cover the meat.
3. Bring the pot with the meat to a boil and then reduce the heat to a simmer. Cook until all the goodness has been boiled out of the meat, usually about 2-3 hours.
4. Once the meat is cooked, strain the broth and add it to the pot with the cooked peas.
5. Stir in the fresh mint leaves, thyme sprigs, and the piece of bacon. Season with salt and pepper to taste.
6. Allow the soup to simmer for another 30 minutes to let the flavors meld together.
7. Remove the piece of bacon and discard.
8. Serve the pea soup hot, garnished with crispy fried bacon and a generous amount of butter.

## Cooking time
