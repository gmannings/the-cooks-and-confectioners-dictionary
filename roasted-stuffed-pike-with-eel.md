## Description
This recipe is for a roasted stuffed pike with eel. The pike is seasoned with salt, pepper, mace, cloves, and savory herbs, and then stuffed with pieces of eel. The pike is then rolled in a caul of veal breast and roasted until cooked through. It is served garnished with flowers and grated lemon.

## Ingredients:
- 1 large pike
- Salt
- Pepper
- Mace
- Cloves
- Savory herbs
- 1 large eel
- Caul of veal breast
- Grated bread
- Flour
- Flowers (for garnish)
- Lemon zest (for garnish)

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to the desired temperature for roasting (e.g. 180Â°C).
2. Scrape the scales off the pike using a knife or fish scaler.
3. Remove the head and tail of the pike, and then gut it.
4. Season the pike with salt, pepper, mace, cloves, and savory herbs, both inside and outside.
5. Bone the large eel and cut it into square pieces, similar to bacon.
6. Season the eel pieces with the same seasoning used for the pike.
7. Stuff the pike with the seasoned eel pieces.
8. Roll the pike in a caul of veal breast, ensuring it is securely wrapped.
9. Tie the rolled pike to a spit or secure it with kitchen twine.
10. Place the pike on the spit or in a roasting pan and roast it in the preheated oven.
11. After the pike has been roasting for about half of the total cooking time, remove the caul from the pike.
12. Sprinkle grated bread over the pike to create a crust.
13. Baste the pike with its own juices and sprinkle it with flour to help create a crispy exterior.
14. Continue roasting the pike until it is cooked through and the crust is golden brown.
15. Once cooked, remove the pike from the oven and let it rest for a few minutes.
16. Garnish the dish with flowers and grated lemon zest.
17. Serve the roasted stuffed pike with eel as a main course.

## Cooking time
Approximately 1-1.5 hours, depending on the size of the pike and the desired level of doneness.
