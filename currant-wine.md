# Currant Wine

## Description
Currant wine is a sweet and fruity wine made from currants. It has a rich flavor and can be enjoyed on its own or used as a base for cocktails.

## Ingredients:
- 11 kg currants
- 7.6 liters water
- 3.6 kg sugar

## Instructions:
1. In a large container, bruise the currants using a masher or the back of a spoon.
2. Add the water to the container and let the currants steep for three days.
3. After three days, strain the mixture to remove the currant solids.
4. Add the sugar to the strained liquid and stir until dissolved.
5. Transfer the mixture to a fermentation vessel, such as a cask, and cover it with a fermentation lock or a clean cloth secured with a rubber band.
6. Allow the mixture to ferment until it has finished working, which usually takes about two weeks. You will know it has finished when there are no more bubbles coming through the fermentation lock or the liquid has become clear.
7. Once fermentation is complete, stop the fermentation by sealing the vessel with an airtight lid or cork.
8. Let the wine stand for two months to allow it to clarify and settle. During this time, any sediment will sink to the bottom.
9. After two months, carefully siphon the clear wine off the sediment, taking care not to disturb it.
10. Taste the wine and if it requires additional sweetness, add more sugar to taste. Stir until the sugar is dissolved.
11. Transfer the wine back into the fermentation vessel and let it stand for another month to allow any remaining sediment to settle.
12. After a month, siphon the wine off the sediment again.
13. If desired, add a small amount of sugar to each bottle before filling them with the wine. This will add a touch of sweetness to the finished wine.
14. Seal the bottles with corks or screw caps and let the wine age for at least six weeks before drinking.

## Cooking time
