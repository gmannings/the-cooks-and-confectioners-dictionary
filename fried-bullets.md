# Fried Bullets

## Description
Fried Bullets is a dish made with small fish, typically sardines or anchovies, that are scaled, gutted, and fried in clarified butter. The fish is then served with a flavorful sauce made from the butter used for frying, along with orange juice, capers, anchovies, and nutmeg. The dish has a rich and tangy flavor, with a hint of garlic or shallot.

## Ingredients:
- Small fish (sardines or anchovies)
- Clarified butter
- Juice of 1 orange
- Capers
- Anchovies
- Nutmeg
- 1 clove of garlic or shallot

## Instructions:
1. Scale the small fish by scraping off the scales using a knife or fish scaler. Rinse the fish under cold water to remove any loose scales.
2. Gut the fish by making a small incision along the belly and removing the innards. Rinse the fish again to ensure they are clean.
3. Gash the fish on the sides by making shallow cuts along the body. This will help the fish cook evenly and allow the flavors to penetrate.
4. Heat a frying pan over medium heat and add enough clarified butter to cover the bottom of the pan.
5. Fry the fish in the clarified butter until they are golden brown and crispy on both sides. This will take about 2-3 minutes per side, depending on the size of the fish. Remove the fish from the pan and set aside.
6. In the same pan, add the juice of 1 orange, capers, anchovies, and a pinch of grated nutmeg. Stir the ingredients together and cook for a few minutes until the sauce is heated through and slightly thickened.
7. Rub the dish with a clove of garlic or shallot to add a subtle garlic or onion flavor.
8. Serve the fried fish on a platter and pour the sauce over the top. Garnish with fresh herbs, if desired.
