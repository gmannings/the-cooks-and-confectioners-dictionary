# Roasted Carp with Mushroom Ragout

## Description
This recipe is for a roasted carp stuffed with a flavorful mixture of eel flesh, mushrooms, chestnuts, bread crumbs, anchovies, onion, parsley, thyme, and sorrel. The carp is then roasted and served with a delicious mushroom ragout, made with mushrooms, carp milt, truffles, morels, and asparagus tops.

## Options and commentary
- You can use any type of white fish instead of carp if desired.
- If you don't have access to carp milt, you can omit it from the stuffing.
- Feel free to adjust the seasoning according to your taste preferences.

## Ingredients:
- 1 large carp (or any white fish)
- 100g eel flesh, finely chopped
- 100g mushrooms, finely chopped
- 50g chestnuts, cooked and chopped
- 50g bread crumbs
- 2 anchovies, finely chopped
- 1 onion, finely chopped
- 2 tablespoons parsley, chopped
- 1 teaspoon thyme
- 1 teaspoon sorrel
- Salt and pepper to taste
- 1/2 teaspoon ground cloves
- 50g butter
- Cloves and bay leaves for garnish
- 200ml warm milk or white wine

For the mushroom ragout:
- 200g mushrooms, sliced
- Carp milt (optional)
- 50g truffles, sliced
- 50g morels, sliced
- Asparagus tops

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 180°C.
2. In a bowl, combine the eel flesh, mushrooms, chestnuts, bread crumbs, anchovies, onion, parsley, thyme, sorrel, salt, pepper, ground cloves, and butter. Mix well to form a stuffing.
3. Clean the carp and make a slit along its body. Stuff the carp with the prepared stuffing, then sew up the slit to secure the stuffing inside.
4. Place the carp on a roasting spit and secure it. Alternatively, you can use a roasting pan.
5. Stick cloves and bay leaves all over the carp.
6. Butter a piece of parchment paper and wrap it tightly around the carp.
7. Place the carp in the preheated oven and roast for about 30-40 minutes, basting it with warm milk or white wine every 10 minutes.
8. While the carp is roasting, prepare the mushroom ragout. In a separate pan, sauté the sliced mushrooms until they release their moisture and start to brown.
9. Add the carp milt (if using), truffles, and morels to the pan. Cook for a few minutes until the flavors meld together.
10. Add the asparagus tops and cook for another 2-3 minutes until they are tender.
11. Remove the carp from the oven and let it rest for a few minutes.
12. Serve the roasted carp with the mushroom ragout on the side.

## Cooking time
Approximately 40 minutes for the roasted carp.
