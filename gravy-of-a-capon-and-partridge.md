# Gravy of a Capon and Partridge

## Description
This recipe is for making a rich and flavorful gravy using the juices from a roasted capon and partridge. The capon and partridge should be partially roasted before being pressed to extract the gravy. This gravy can be served with roasted meats or used as a base for other dishes.

## Ingredients:
- 1 roasted capon
- 2 roasted partridges

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F).
2. Roast the capon and partridges in the preheated oven until they are more than half cooked. This will ensure that they have released enough juices for the gravy.
3. Remove the capon and partridges from the oven and let them cool slightly.
4. Place the capon and partridges in a press specifically designed for extracting juices. If you don't have a press, you can use a clean kitchen towel or cheesecloth to squeeze out the juices.
5. Apply pressure to the capon and partridges in the press or wrap them tightly in the kitchen towel or cheesecloth and squeeze out as much juice as possible. Collect the juice in a bowl or container.
6. Strain the collected juice through a fine-mesh sieve to remove any solids or impurities.
7. The resulting liquid is the gravy of the capon and partridge. Use it immediately or store it in the refrigerator for later use.

## Cooking time
Approximately 1-2 hours, depending on the size of the capon and partridges.
