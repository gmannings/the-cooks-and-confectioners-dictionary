# Turkey Farced with Fine Herbs

## Description
This recipe is for a turkey that is stuffed with a flavorful mixture of raw bacon, sweet herbs, parsley, and chives. The turkey is then roasted and served with a delicious garnish. This dish is perfect for a special occasion or holiday meal.

## Options and commentary
- You can use any type of turkey for this recipe, but a fresh, organic turkey will provide the best flavor.
- Feel free to adjust the herbs and seasonings to your taste. You can add other herbs like thyme or rosemary for additional flavor.
- If you prefer, you can use a different type of poultry, such as chicken or duck, instead of turkey.

## Ingredients:
- 1 turkey (approximately 5 kg)
- 200 grams of raw bacon
- A handful of fresh sweet herbs (such as sage, thyme, and marjoram)
- 1 bunch of fresh parsley
- 4 chives
- Salt and pepper to taste
- Garnish ingredients of your choice (such as roasted vegetables or cranberry sauce)

## Instructions:
1. Preheat your oven to 180°C.
2. Loosen the skin on the breast of the turkey by gently sliding your fingers between the skin and the meat. Be careful not to tear the skin.
3. In a mortar and pestle, pound the raw bacon, sweet herbs, parsley, and chives until well combined and finely chopped.
4. Season the herb mixture with salt and pepper to taste.
5. Stuff the herb mixture under the loosened skin of the turkey breast, spreading it evenly.
6. Place any remaining herb mixture into the body cavity of the turkey.
7. Secure the turkey with a kitchen twine or skewers to keep the stuffing in place.
8. Place the turkey on a roasting rack in a roasting pan.
9. Roast the turkey in the preheated oven for approximately 3 to 4 hours, or until the internal temperature reaches 75°C. Baste the turkey with its own juices every 30 minutes.
10. Once the turkey is cooked, remove it from the oven and let it rest for 20 minutes before carving.
11. While the turkey is resting, prepare a ragout or garnish of your choice to serve alongside the turkey.
12. Carve the turkey and serve it hot with the garnish.

## Cooking time
Approximately 3 to 4 hours, depending on the size of the turkey.
