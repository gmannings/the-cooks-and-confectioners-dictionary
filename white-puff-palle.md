# White Puff-Palle

## Description
White Puff-Palle is a classic 18th-century pastry made with a simple dough of flour and egg whites, rolled with butter. It results in a light and flaky pastry that can be used for both sweet and savory dishes.

## Options and commentary
- You can add a pinch of salt to the dough for added flavor.
- You can use unsalted butter for a milder taste, or salted butter for a slightly savory flavor.
- This recipe can be easily scaled up or down depending on your needs.

## Ingredients:
- 500g all-purpose flour
- 6 egg whites
- 450g butter, chilled

## Instructions:
1. Preheat your oven to 200°C (400°F).
2. In a large mixing bowl, combine the flour and egg whites. Mix until a dough forms. If the dough is too dry, add a little cold water, one tablespoon at a time, until it comes together.
3. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead it for a few minutes until it becomes smooth and elastic.
4. Divide the dough into two equal portions.
5. Roll out one portion of the dough into a large rectangle, about 1/4 inch thick.
6. Cut the chilled butter into thin slices and arrange them evenly over the surface of the dough.
7. Fold the dough in half lengthwise, covering the butter completely.
8. Roll out the folded dough again into a large rectangle, about 1/4 inch thick.
9. Repeat steps 6-8 with the second portion of dough and the remaining butter.
10. Fold the rolled-out dough in half lengthwise again, covering the butter completely.
11. Roll out the folded dough one more time into a large rectangle, about 1/4 inch thick.
12. Cut the dough into small squares or circles, or use a cookie cutter to create desired shapes.
13. Place the pastry shapes onto a baking sheet lined with parchment paper.
14. Bake in the preheated oven for about 15-20 minutes, or until the pastries are golden brown and puffed up.
15. Remove from the oven and let cool on a wire rack before serving.
