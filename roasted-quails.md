# Roasted Quails

## Description
Roasted quails stuffed with a mixture of beef suet and herbs, basted with butter, and served with a tangy sauce made from anchovy, shallots, citrus juice, and garnished with lemon peel and grated bread.

## Ingredients:
- 4 quails
- 100g beef suet
- 2 tablespoons chopped fresh herbs (such as parsley, thyme, and rosemary)
- Salt and pepper, to taste
- 2 tablespoons butter
- 1 anchovy fillet
- 2 shallots, sliced
- Juice of 2-3 Seville oranges
- Juice of 1 lemon
- Lemon peel, for garnish
- Grated bread (breadcrumbs), for garnish

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F).
2. Truss the quails by tying the legs together with kitchen twine.
3. In a bowl, mix together the beef suet, chopped fresh herbs, salt, and pepper.
