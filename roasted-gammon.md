# Roasted Gammon

## Description
Roasted Gammon is a classic dish made from a cured and smoked ham. The gammon is soaked in a mixture of Canary wine and then roasted to perfection. The result is a flavorful and juicy ham with a crispy exterior.

## Ingredients:
- 1 gammon (cured and smoked ham)
- 1 liter of Canary wine (or any dry white wine)

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F).
2. Remove the rind from the gammon and place it in a bowl of warm water to soften.
3. In a large pan, pour the Canary wine over the gammon and let it soak for twelve hours.
4. After soaking, remove the gammon from the wine and pat it dry with paper towels.
5. Place the gammon on a roasting spit or rack.
6. Cover the gammon with a few sheets of white paper to prevent it from drying out during roasting.
7. Place the gammon in the preheated oven and roast for approximately 20 minutes per pound (or 45 minutes per kilogram) of gammon. 
8. Baste the gammon with the wine marinade every 30 minutes to keep it moist and flavorful.
9. Remove the gammon from the oven and let it rest for 10-15 minutes before carving.
10. Serve the roasted gammon hot with your choice of side dishes.
