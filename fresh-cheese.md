# Fresh Cheese

## Description
This recipe is for making fresh cheese using raw cream. The cheese is sweetened with sugar and flavored with damask rosewater. It is a creamy and delicate cheese that can be served as a dessert or used in various recipes.

## Ingredients:
- 2 liters of raw cream
- Sugar, to taste
- Damask rosewater

## Instructions:
1. In a large pot, pour the raw cream and sweeten it with sugar to your desired level of sweetness.
2. Place the pot on the stove and bring the cream to a boil, stirring occasionally to prevent it from burning.
3. Once the cream has thickened and turned into curds, remove it from the heat.
4. Wash a strainer and cheese cloth with rosewater to ensure they are clean and fragrant.
5. Place the strainer over a bowl or sink and pour the curds into the strainer to separate the whey from the cheese.
6. Gently roll the curds back and forth in the strainer to help drain the whey.
7. Transfer the drained curds into a cheese mold or dish.
8. Allow the cheese to cool completely in the mold or dish.
9. Once cooled, carefully remove the cheese from the mold or dish and place it on a serving dish.
