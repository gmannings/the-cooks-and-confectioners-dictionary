# Quince Preserves for Pies

## Description
This recipe is for preserving quinces to be used as filling for pies. The quinces are cooked in small beer and then stored in a sealed container to keep them fresh for a long time.

## Ingredients:
- 1 kg quinces
- 1 liter small beer (or substitute with apple cider or apple juice)

## Instructions:
1. Wash the quinces thoroughly to remove any dirt or residue.
2. Peel the quinces and remove the cores. Cut them into small, even-sized pieces.
3. In a large pot, pour the small beer (or substitute) and bring it to a boil.
4. Add the quince pieces to the boiling small beer and reduce the heat to low.
5. Simmer the quinces in the small beer for about 30-40 minutes, or until they become soft and tender.
6. Remove the pot from the heat and let the quinces cool down completely.
7. Once cooled, transfer the quinces and the small beer into a clean, airtight container.
8. Seal the container tightly to prevent any air from getting in.
9. Store the container in a cool, dark place, such as a pantry or cellar.
10. The quinces will keep well for up to a year.

## Options and commentary
- Quinces can be quite hard and difficult to peel. To make it easier, you can briefly blanch them in boiling water for a few minutes before peeling.
- Small beer is a type of low-alcohol beer that was commonly used in the 18th century. If you can't find small beer, you can substitute it with apple cider or apple juice for a similar flavor.
- These preserved quinces can be used as a filling for pies, tarts, or other baked goods. They can also be enjoyed on their own as a sweet and tangy preserve.
- Make sure to use a clean and airtight container to store the quinces. This will help prevent spoilage and maintain their freshness for a longer period of time.

## Cooking time
Approximately 30-40 minutes.
