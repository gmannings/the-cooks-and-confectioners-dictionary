# Marmalade of Apricots

## Description
This recipe is for making a delicious marmalade using ripe apricots and sugar. The apricots are cooked down until they become a thick syrupy consistency, resulting in a sweet and tangy spread that can be enjoyed on toast, pastries, or used as a filling in desserts.

## Options and commentary
- You can adjust the amount of sugar according to your taste preference. If you prefer a sweeter marmalade, you can increase the amount of sugar slightly.
- You can also add a squeeze of lemon juice to enhance the flavor of the apricots.

## Ingredients:
- 1 kg ripe apricots
- 750 g granulated sugar

## Instructions:
1. Wash the apricots and remove any stems or leaves. Cut the apricots in half, remove the pits, and cut them into quarters. Remove any strings if present.
2. In a large, wide pan, place the apricots without adding any water or sugar. Cook them over medium heat, stirring constantly to prevent burning.
3. As the apricots start to melt and release their juices, gradually sprinkle in the sugar. Stir well to combine.
4. Continue cooking the apricots and sugar mixture, stirring frequently, until the syrup thickens and the apricots become translucent. This process may take around 30-40 minutes.
5. To test if the marmalade is ready, place a small amount on a chilled plate. If it sets and wrinkles when pushed with your finger, it is done. If not, continue cooking for a few more minutes and test again.
6. Once the marmalade reaches the desired consistency, remove it from the heat and let it cool slightly.
7. Transfer the marmalade into clean, sterilized jars or glasses. Seal tightly and let them cool completely before storing in the refrigerator.
8. The marmalade can be stored in the refrigerator for up to several weeks.

## Cooking time
Approximately 30-40 minutes.
