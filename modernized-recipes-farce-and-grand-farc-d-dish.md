# Modernized Recipes: Farce and Grand Farc'd Dish

## Description
These recipes are from an 18th-century cookbook and involve making a farce (stuffing) for fowls and a grand farc'd dish. The farce is made with a mixture of veal sweetbreads, marrow, oysters, anchovies, herbs, and spices. The grand farc'd dish is a complex dish that includes stuffed eggs, preserved oranges, various fried ingredients like asparagus, sweetbreads, and artichoke bottoms, as well as other ingredients like chestnuts, pistachios, and Parmesan balls. The dish is garnished with marrow and orange juice.
