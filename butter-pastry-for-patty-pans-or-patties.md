# Butter Pastry for Patty Pans or Patties

## Description
This recipe is for making a butter pastry dough that can be used to make either small individual patty pans or larger patties. The dough is made with flour, butter, and eggs, and is mixed with cold spring water. The resulting pastry is rich and flaky, perfect for filling with sweet or savory fillings.

## Options and commentary
- You can use all-purpose flour for this recipe.
- If you prefer a lighter pastry, you can use half butter and half vegetable shortening.
- You can add a pinch of salt for flavor.
- The amount of water needed may vary, so add it gradually until the dough comes together.

## Ingredients:
- 500 grams all-purpose flour
- 500 grams unsalted butter, cold and cubed
- 3 egg whites
- Cold spring water

## Instructions:
1. In a large mixing bowl, combine the flour and cold cubed butter.
2. Using your fingertips or a pastry cutter, rub the butter into the flour until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs.
3. In a separate bowl, lightly beat the egg whites.
4. Make a well in the center of the flour mixture and pour in the beaten egg whites.
5. Gradually mix the flour and egg whites together, adding cold spring water a little at a time, until the dough comes together. Be careful not to overmix.
6. Once the dough has come together, turn it out onto a lightly floured surface and knead it gently until smooth.
7. Divide the dough into two equal portions and shape each portion into a disc. Wrap each disc in plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes to allow the dough to rest and firm up.
