# Peas Potage

## Description
Peas Potage is a thick and hearty soup made with peas, vegetables, and herbs. It is a comforting and nutritious dish that can be enjoyed as a main course or as a side dish.

## Options and commentary
- You can use fresh or frozen peas for this recipe. If using fresh peas, shell them before cooking.
- Feel free to add other vegetables such as carrots or celery for added flavor and texture.
- You can use vegetable broth instead of water for a richer flavor.
- For the forced meat, you can use ground meat of your choice, such as beef or pork.

## Ingredients:
- 500g peas (fresh or frozen)
- 3 liters water or vegetable broth
- 1 large onion, chopped
- 2 handfuls of spinach, chopped
- 1 leek, sliced
- A small bunch of mint, chopped
- 1 tablespoon flour
- 200g forced meat (ground meat)

## Instructions:
1. In a large pot, combine the peas and water (or vegetable broth). Season with salt and pepper.
2. Add the chopped onion to the pot and bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer until the peas are soft.
3. Once the peas are soft, strain them through a colander to remove any solids. Return the strained liquid to the pot.
4. Place the pot back on the stove and bring the liquid to a boil again.
5. Add the chopped spinach, sliced leek, and chopped mint to the pot. Cook for a few minutes until the vegetables are tender.
6. In a small bowl, mix the flour with a little water to make a paste. Add this paste to the pot and stir well to thicken the soup.
7. Finally, add the forced meat to the pot and cook for another 10 minutes, or until the meat is cooked through.

## Cooking time
Approximately 1 hour.
