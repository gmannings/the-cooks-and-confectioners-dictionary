# Conserve of Raspberries

## Description
This recipe is for making a sweet and flavorful conserve using raspberries and currants. The mixture is cooked down to extract the juice, strained, and then combined with sugar to create a thick and tasty preserve. The conserve can be molded into shapes for serving.

## Ingredients:
- 500g ripe currants
- 250g raspberries
- 500g sugar

## Instructions:
1. Pick and clean the currants, removing any stems or leaves.
2. In a copper pan, combine the currants and raspberries to give them a nice aroma and flavor.
3. Place the pan over medium heat and cook the fruits until they release their juice. Stir occasionally to prevent sticking.
4. Once the fruits have released their juice, remove the pan from the heat and strain the mixture through a sieve to remove any solids.
5. Return the strained liquid to the pan and place it back over the heat to dry out. Stir occasionally to prevent burning.
6. While the liquid is drying out, prepare the sugar by boiling it until it reaches the "crack" stage. This is when the sugar forms hard threads when dropped into cold water.
7. Once the sugar has reached the desired stage, carefully add the thick substance of the fruit mixture to the pan. Use enough to give the conserve a good color and taste. Stir well to combine.
8. Continue cooking the mixture over low heat, stirring constantly, until the sugar and fruit mixture is well incorporated and thickened.
9. Remove the pan from the heat and allow it to cool slightly.
10. Work the sugar by stirring it vigorously until it becomes white and forms a thin ice on the top.
11. Once the sugar has reached the desired consistency, take off the pan and transfer the conserve into molds.
12. Allow the conserve to cool and set in the molds before serving.

## Cooking time
Approximately 1-2 hours, depending on the heat and desired thickness of the conserve.
