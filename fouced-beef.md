## Ingredients:
- 1.5 kg beef (buttock, chuck, or brisket)
- Salt
- Pepper
- Water
- Vinegar
- White wine
- Sugar
- Mustard

## Instructions:
1. Season the beef with salt and pepper, ensuring it is evenly coated. Place it in a container and refrigerate for four days to allow the flavors to develop.
2. After four days, remove the beef from the refrigerator and roll it up as evenly as possible. Secure it with kitchen twine or use a cloth to wrap it tightly.
3. Fill a large pot with water and add salt. Bring the water to a boil.
4. Carefully place the rolled beef into the boiling water. Reduce the heat to a simmer and cook the beef until it is tender. This may take several hours, depending on the cut of beef.
5. Once the beef is tender, remove it from the pot and allow it to cool slightly.
6. In a separate bowl, combine water, vinegar, white wine, and a little salt to create a soaking mixture.
7. Place the cooked beef into the soaking mixture and let it sit for a few hours to absorb the flavors.
8. After soaking, remove the beef from the mixture and shape it into a round and upright form using a hoop frame or by carefully molding it with your hands.
9. Place the shaped beef in a smoky place or in a well-ventilated area to dry. This can take several days, depending on the desired level of dryness.
10. Once the beef is fully dried, it is ready to be served.
11. To serve, cut the fouced beef into thin slices and arrange them on a platter.
12. Serve the fouced beef with sugar and mustard on the side for dipping or sprinkling.
