# Codlin Tart

## Description
Codlin Tart is a traditional 18th-century dessert made with scalded codlins (a type of apple), sugar, and musk. The tart is filled with the codlins, sweetened with sugar and musk, and then baked. A creamy custard made with cream, egg yolks, sugar, and musk is poured over the tart halfway through baking. The tart is finished with a sprinkle of sugar and served hot.

## Ingredients:
- Codlins (green apples)
- Sugar
- Musk (optional)
- Pie crust
- Cream
- Egg yolks

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 180Â°C.
2. Scald the codlins by placing them in boiling water for a few minutes until the skin starts to peel. Remove the codlins from the water and let them stand covered for an hour. This will give them a green color.
3. Prepare the pie crust by rolling it out and lining a tart pan.
4. Place the scalded codlins in the tart, either whole or quartered.
5. Sprinkle sugar and a little musk over the codlins.
6. Close the tart with a lid, making sure to carve a design on the lid.
7. Bake the tart in the preheated oven for about 20 minutes.
8. While the tart is baking, prepare the creamy custard. In a saucepan, heat a quart of cream until it starts to simmer.
9. In a separate bowl, whisk together the egg yolks, sugar, and a little musk.
10. Slowly pour the hot cream into the egg yolk mixture, whisking constantly.
11. Once the tart is half-baked, remove it from the oven and carefully cut it open.
12. Pour the creamy custard mixture over the codlins in the tart.
13. Place the tart back in the oven and bake for another 30 minutes.
14. Remove the tart from the oven and sprinkle some sugar over the top.
15. Serve the Codlin Tart hot.
