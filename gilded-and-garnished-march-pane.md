# Gilded and Garnished March-pane

## Description
Gilded and Garnished March-pane is a sweet almond paste dessert that was popular in the 18th century. It is made by blanching almonds, pounding them into a paste with rosewater, sugar, and water, rolling it out, baking it, and then decorating it with icing, comfits, and gold leaf.

## Ingredients:
- 250g blanched almonds
- 50ml rosewater
- 200g sugar
- 2 egg whites
- 1 tsp rosewater
- Edible gold leaf
- Gum arabic or edible glue
- Comfits (small colored sugar balls)

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F).

2. Blanch the almonds by placing them in boiling water for a few minutes, then drain and remove the skins.

3. Place the blanched almonds in a mortar and pound them until they form a smooth paste. Add a little rosewater to help with the grinding process.

4. In a separate bowl, sift the sugar to make it fine and then mix it with the almond paste until well combined.

5. Roll out the almond paste into a flat sheet, about 1/4 inch thick. Place a sheet of white paper on top of the almond paste to protect it during baking.

6. Use a marking iron or any decorative tool to make impressions or patterns on the almond paste through the paper. This will create a decorative design on the final dessert.

7. Remove the paper and transfer the almond paste to a baking sheet. Bake in the preheated oven for about 15-20 minutes, or until the edges are golden brown.

8. While the almond paste is baking, prepare the icing by beating the egg whites with rosewater and sugar until stiff peaks form.

9. Once the almond paste is baked, remove it from the oven and let it cool completely.

10. Spread a thin layer of the prepared icing over the surface of the almond paste.

11. Garnish the iced surface with comfits, scattering them evenly over the top.

12. Cut the edible gold leaf into various shapes or patterns.

13. Dilute gum arabic or edible glue with a little water to create a sticky adhesive.

14. Brush the surface of the almond paste with the gum arabic or edible glue.

15. Carefully place the gold leaf pieces onto the sticky surface, pressing gently to adhere.

16. Allow the gilded and garnished march-pane to dry and set before serving.
