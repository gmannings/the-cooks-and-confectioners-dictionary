# Boiling Sugar to its Blown Quality

## Description
This recipe is for boiling sugar to its "blown" quality, which means it has reached a specific temperature and consistency. This technique was commonly used in the 18th century to create sugar decorations and confections.

## Ingredients:
- Granulated sugar

## Instructions:
1. In a heavy-bottomed saucepan, add the granulated sugar. The amount of sugar will depend on your desired quantity of blown sugar.
2. Place the saucepan over medium heat and let the sugar melt. Do not stir the sugar at this point.
3. Once the sugar has completely melted and turned into a clear syrup, increase the heat to medium-high.
4. Allow the sugar syrup to come to a boil. It will start to bubble and froth.
5. After a few minutes of boiling, take a skimmer or a slotted spoon and shake it gently with your hand. This will help release any trapped air bubbles in the syrup.
6. Beat the side of the saucepan with the skimmer or spoon. This will further help release any trapped air bubbles.
7. Blow through the holes of the skimmer or spoon and observe the sugar syrup closely.
8. If you see certain sparks or small bubbles flying out of the syrup, it has reached the "blown" quality. This means it has reached the desired temperature and consistency.
9. Remove the saucepan from the heat immediately to prevent the sugar from burning.

## Cooking time
The cooking time will vary depending on the quantity of sugar being boiled and the heat intensity. It usually takes around 10-15 minutes for the sugar to reach the "blown" quality.
