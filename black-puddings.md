# Black Puddings

## Description
Black puddings are a type of sausage made with oatmeal, milk, bread, eggs, herbs, spices, blood, and beef suet. They are traditionally boiled and then fried until fully cooked.

## Ingredients:
- 120g oatmeal
- 2 liters of whole milk
- 400g grated bread
- 2 eggs
- Salt, to taste
- 1/2 teaspoon ground mace
- 1/2 teaspoon ground cloves
- 1 tablespoon chopped sage
- 1 tablespoon chopped pennyroyal
- 1 tablespoon chopped other sweet herbs (such as thyme or parsley)
- 180ml blood (pork or beef)
- 115g beef suet, finely shredded
- 225g lard, cut into long pieces

## Instructions:
1. In a large bowl, combine the oatmeal and milk. Let it steep overnight, or alternatively, bring it to a boil and cook until it reaches the thickness of a pudding. 
2. Add the grated bread, eggs, salt, mace, cloves, sage, pennyroyal, and other sweet herbs to the oatmeal mixture. Mix well to combine.
3. Strain the blood into the mixture and stir until fully incorporated.
4. Add the shredded beef suet to the mixture. If the mixture is not soft enough, add more milk as needed.
5. Cut the lard into long pieces.
6. Fill the lard with the pudding mixture and secure the ends.
7. Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Carefully place the filled lard into the boiling water and cook for a few minutes.
8. Remove the lard from the water and prick them with a pin to release any trapped air.
9. Return the lard to the boiling water and continue cooking until the puddings are fully cooked.

## Cooking time
Approximately 1-2 hours, depending on the size of the puddings.
