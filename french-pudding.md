# French Pudding

## Description
French Pudding is a traditional 18th-century dessert made with bread, raisins, beef suet, sugar, marrow, cream, eggs, and various spices. It is a rich and flavorful pudding with a combination of sweet and savory ingredients.

## Options and commentary
- You can use any type of white bread, such as a baguette or sandwich bread, as a substitute for the penny white loaves.
- Instead of beef suet, you can use butter or vegetable shortening for a vegetarian version.
- Marrow can be difficult to find, so you can omit it or substitute it with additional butter.
- You can use any type of apple, such as Granny Smith or Golden Delicious, as a substitute for the pippin.
- Pome-waters are an old variety of apple, but you can use any type of apple as a substitute.
