# Sauſages

## Description
This recipe is for making sausages using sheep's guts as casings. The sausages are made with minced pork, seasoned with salt, pepper, cloves, and mace. Spinach and herbs such as sage and savory are added for flavor. The sausages can also be enhanced with minced oysters for a special touch.

## Options and commentary
- Instead of sheep's guts, you can use synthetic sausage casings or natural casings made from other animals such as hog casings.
- You can use any cut of pork that you prefer, such as leg or loin.
- Adjust the seasoning according to your taste preferences.
- Adding minced oysters is optional and can be omitted if desired.

## Ingredients:
- Sheep's guts (or synthetic sausage casings)
- 500g pork (leg or loin)
- Salt
- Pepper
- Cloves
- Mace
- 1 onion
- 1 shallot
- Spinach
- Sage
- Savory
- 2 egg yolks
- Flour
- Oysters (optional)

## Instructions:
1. Clean the sheep's guts thoroughly, removing any debris or impurities. If using synthetic casings, follow the manufacturer's instructions for preparation.
2. Break the bones of the pork into small pieces.
3. In a large pot, bring enough water to cover the pork bones to a boil. Skim off any impurities that rise to the surface.
4. Season the boiling water with salt, pepper, whole mace, chopped onion, and chopped shallot.
5. Boil the pork bones until all the goodness is extracted, usually around 1-2 hours. 
6. Strain the liquid and set it aside to cool.
7. Mince the pork meat finely.
8. Season the minced pork with salt, pepper, cloves, and mace. 
9. Add a handful of shredded spinach to give the sausages a green color.
10. Add chopped sage and savory for additional flavor.
11. Mix in the egg yolks to moisten the minced meat and herbs.
12. Gradually add the cooled pork bone liquid to make the mixture moist but not too wet.
13. To test the seasoning, roll a small portion of the minced meat in flour and fry it in a pan. Adjust the seasoning if needed.
14. If desired, mince a few oysters and add them to the minced meat mixture.
15. Stuff the minced meat mixture into the sheep's guts or synthetic casings, using a sausage stuffer or a piping bag.
16. Twist the casings at regular intervals to form individual sausages.
17. If not cooking immediately, store the sausages in the refrigerator until ready to use.
