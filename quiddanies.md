# Quiddanies

## Description
Quiddanies are a type of fruit preserve or confectionery made from various fruits such as pippins (apples) and raspberries. They are typically sweet and can be enjoyed as a snack or used as a topping for desserts.

## Ingredients:
- 500g apples (pippins)
- 500g raspberries
- 500g sugar

## Instructions:
1. Wash and peel the apples. Remove the cores and cut them into small pieces.
2. Place the apple pieces in a saucepan and add a small amount of water. Cook over medium heat until the apples are soft and mushy.
3. In a separate saucepan, add the raspberries and cook over low heat until they break down and release their juices.
4. Once the raspberries have softened, strain them through a fine mesh sieve to remove the seeds. 
5. Combine the strained raspberries with the cooked apples in a large saucepan.
6. Add the sugar to the fruit mixture and stir well to combine.
7. Place the saucepan over medium heat and cook the mixture, stirring constantly, until it thickens and reaches a jam-like consistency.
8. Remove the saucepan from the heat and let the quiddanies cool.
9. Once cooled, transfer the quiddanies to sterilized jars and seal tightly.
