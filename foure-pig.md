# Foure à Pig

## Description
Foure à Pig is a traditional 18th-century dish made with a young pig that is boned, rolled, and boiled until tender. It is then served cold in a flavorful sauce made with white wine and bay leaves. This dish is similar to brawn, a type of jellied meat commonly made in the past.

## Options and commentary
- Instead of a whole young pig, you can use a pork loin or pork shoulder for a smaller portion.
- If you prefer a different type of meat, you can use chicken or turkey breast.
- The dish is traditionally served with green fennel and vinegar, but you can also serve it with pickles or mustard.

## Ingredients:
- 1 young pig (or pork loin/pork shoulder/chicken breast/turkey breast)
- Water
- Salt
- 1 quart (946 ml) white wine
- 2-3 bay leaves
- Green fennel (for serving)
- Vinegar (for serving)

## Instructions:
1. If using a young pig, remove the head and split the body in half lengthwise. Bone the pig, removing all the bones from the meat. If using an alternative meat, skip this step.
2. Place the boned pig or alternative meat in a large bowl and cover it with warm water. Let it soak overnight.
3. The next day, drain the water from the bowl and shape the meat into a collar-like roll, similar to brawn.
4. Fill a large pot with water and add salt. Bring the water to a boil and carefully place the rolled meat into the pot.
5. Reduce the heat to a simmer and cook the meat until it is tender. The cooking time will vary depending on the size and type of meat used. For a young pig, it may take several hours. For alternative meats, it may take 1-2 hours.
6. While the meat is cooking, prepare the sauce. In a separate pot, combine 1 quart of the cooking liquid from the meat with 1 quart of white wine. Add the bay leaves and bring the mixture to a boil. Let it simmer for about 10 minutes to infuse the flavors.
7. Remove the sauce from the heat and let it cool completely.
8. Once the meat is tender, remove it from the pot and place it in an earthenware pan. Pour the cooled sauce over the meat, making sure it is completely covered.
9. Allow the meat to cool in the sauce, then refrigerate it for at least a few hours or overnight. This will allow the flavors to develop and the meat to set.
10. To serve, remove the meat from the sauce and slice it into thin pieces. Arrange the slices on a platter.
11. Serve the Foure à Pig with green fennel and vinegar on the side. Alternatively, you can serve it with pickles or mustard.

## Cooking time
- Cooking the meat: Several hours for a young pig, 1-2 hours for alternative meats.
- Cooling and refrigeration time: At least a few hours or overnight.
