# Smooth Boiling of Sugar

## Description
This recipe provides instructions on how to boil sugar to achieve a smooth consistency. It involves clarifying the sugar first and then boiling it until it reaches the desired smoothness. The smoothness can be tested by dipping the tip of your finger into the sugar and observing the formation of a thread or string.

## Ingredients:
- Granulated sugar

## Instructions:
1. Clarify the sugar by dissolving it in water. Use a ratio of 1 part sugar to 1 part water.
2. Place the sugar-water mixture in a saucepan and heat it over medium heat.
3. Stir the mixture continuously until the sugar is completely dissolved.
4. Once the sugar is dissolved, increase the heat to high and bring the mixture to a boil.
5. Reduce the heat to medium and continue boiling the sugar mixture.
6. To test the smoothness of the sugar, dip the tip of your forefinger into the boiling sugar and then touch it to your thumb.
7. Slowly separate your finger and thumb to observe if a small thread or string forms between them.
8. If a small thread or string forms and immediately breaks, the sugar has boiled until it is a little smooth.
9. If the thread or string extends further before breaking, the sugar is very smooth.
10. Continue boiling the sugar until it reaches the desired smoothness, based on the thread or string test.

## Cooking time
Approximately 10-15 minutes, depending on the desired smoothness of the sugar.
