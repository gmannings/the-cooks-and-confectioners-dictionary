# Paste Royal

## Description
Paste Royal is a versatile pastry dough that can be used for various sweet dishes such as tarts, puddings, and as a garnish for dishes. It is made with flour, sugar, eggs, spices, and a combination of wine and cream.

## Ingredients:
- 900 grams of all-purpose flour
- 225 grams of powdered sugar
- 1/2 teaspoon of ground nutmeg
- 1/2 teaspoon of ground cinnamon
- 20 egg whites
- 240 ml of Canary wine (or any sweet white wine)
- 240 ml of heavy cream
- 450 grams of unsalted butter, softened

## Instructions:
1. In a large mixing bowl, combine the flour, powdered sugar, nutmeg, and cinnamon. Mix well to evenly distribute the spices.
2. In a separate bowl, beat the egg whites until frothy and slightly stiff.
3. Gradually add the beaten egg whites to the dry ingredients, mixing well after each addition.
4. Slowly pour in the Canary wine and heavy cream, stirring continuously until a stiff dough forms.
5. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead it for a few minutes until smooth and elastic.
6. Divide the dough into two equal portions and shape each portion into a ball.
7. Flatten each ball slightly and wrap them separately in plastic wrap. Refrigerate for at least 30 minutes to allow the dough to rest and firm up.
8. Take one portion of the dough out of the refrigerator and roll it out into a large rectangle, about 1/4 inch thick.
9. Spread a portion of the softened butter evenly over the rolled-out dough.
10. Fold the dough into thirds, like a letter, and then roll it out again into a rectangle.
11. Repeat steps 9 and 10 four to five more times, incorporating the remaining butter with each rolling.
12. Repeat steps 8-11 with the second portion of dough.
13. Once both portions of dough have been rolled and folded multiple times, wrap them in plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 1 hour before using.
14. The Paste Royal is now ready to be used for various sweet dishes such as orange puddings, tarts, or as a garnish for dishes.
