# Capon Pasty

## Description
Capon Pasty is a savory pie made with roasted capon (a castrated rooster), lamb stones (testicles), sweetbreads, oysters, and various herbs and spices. The ingredients are layered in a pastry crust and baked until golden and delicious. This dish was popular in the 18th century and can be enjoyed as a main course.

## Options and commentary
- If you can't find capon, you can substitute it with chicken or turkey.
- Lamb stones can be difficult to find, so you can omit them or replace them with chicken or veal sweetbreads.
- If you don't like oysters, you can leave them out or substitute them with mushrooms.
- The herbs and spices can be adjusted to your taste preferences.

## Ingredients:
- 1 capon (or chicken or turkey)
- 3 pairs of lamb stones (or chicken or veal sweetbreads)
- 4 sweetbreads
- 1/2 pint of oysters
- Salt
- Cloves
- Nutmeg
- Mace
- Sweet marjoram
- Penny-royal
- Thyme
- 1 sheet of pastry crust
- 1 minced onion
- Handful of boiled and blanched chestnuts
- Butter
- Gravy
- Strong broth
- Drawn butter
- Anchovies, dissolved
- Grated nutmeg
- Slices of lemon (for garnish)

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F).
2. Roast the capon until fully cooked. Let it cool, then remove the flesh from the bones and slice it. Keep the thighs and pinions whole.
3. In a bowl, combine the sliced capon flesh, lamb stones (or sweetbreads), sweetbreads, and oysters. Season with salt, cloves, nutmeg, mace, sweet marjoram, penny-royal, and thyme. Mix well to combine.
4. Line a pastry pan with a sheet of pastry crust.
5. Place the thighs and pinions on the bottom of the pastry pan and sprinkle minced onion over them.
6. Layer the sliced capon flesh, sweetbreads, lamb stones (or sweetbreads), and halved oysters on top of the thighs and pinions.
7. Add the boiled and blanched chestnuts and dot with butter.
8. Cover the pan with another sheet of pastry crust and seal the edges.
9. Bake the pasty in the preheated oven for about 1 hour, or until the crust is golden brown.
10. While the pasty is baking, prepare the sauce. In a saucepan, combine gravy, strong broth, drawn butter, and dissolved anchovies. Season with grated nutmeg.
11. Once the pasty is baked, remove it from the oven and pour the sauce over it.
12. Garnish the pasty with slices of lemon.
13. Serve the Capon Pasty hot.
