# Mulberry Wine

## Description
Mulberry wine is a sweet and fruity wine made from ripe mulberries. It is a traditional drink that can be enjoyed on its own or used as a base for cocktails.

## Options and commentary
- You can adjust the sweetness of the wine by adding sugar to taste.
- If fresh mulberries are not available, you can use frozen mulberries or mulberry juice.
- The fermentation process can take several weeks to several months, depending on the desired flavor and strength of the wine.

## Ingredients:
- 2 kg ripe mulberries
- 1 kg sugar
- Wine yeast (follow package instructions for amount)
- Water

## Instructions:
1. Gather ripe mulberries and remove the stalks.
2. Place the mulberries in a large pot and crush them to release the juice. You can use a potato masher or your hands.
3. Transfer the crushed mulberries to a hair bag or cheesecloth and squeeze out the juice into a clean container.
4. In a separate pot, dissolve the sugar in water over low heat to create a simple syrup. Let it cool.
5. Add the mulberry juice and wine yeast to the simple syrup and stir well.
6. Pour the mixture into a fermentation vessel, leaving some headspace for the wine to expand during fermentation.
7. Cover the vessel with a clean cloth or fermentation lock to allow gases to escape while preventing contamination.
8. Place the vessel in a warm location, away from cold drafts, and let it ferment for about 12-15 days. Stir the mixture daily to help with fermentation.
9. After the initial fermentation, replenish the vessel with additional mulberry juice every few days to continue the fermentation process. Repeat this step until the wine is fully fermented.
10. During fermentation, keep the vessel in a warm place to maintain the fermentation process. Avoid exposure to cold winds, as they can cause the wine to turn acidic.
11. Around the end of March, when the fermentation is complete, seal the vessel tightly to stop any further fermentation.
12. Optional: Some people add the leftover mulberry pulp or pressings to the juice for a couple of days to enhance the color and flavor of the wine.
13. Optional: To clarify the wine, gently roll the vessel to mix it with the lees (sediment). When the wine has cleared, carefully rack it off by siphoning it into clean bottles, leaving the sediment behind.
14. Store the bottled wine in a cool, dark place for at least a few months to allow it to mature and develop its flavors.

## Cooking time
Several weeks to several months, depending on fermentation and maturation time.
