# Beef Cullis

## Description
Beef Cullis is a rich and flavorful sauce made from roasted beef, game bird carcasses, bread crusts, strong gravy, and broth. It is seasoned with salt, pepper, cloves, thyme, sweet basil, and a piece of green lemon. The ingredients are simmered together and then strained to create a smooth and velvety sauce.

## Options and commentary
- You can use any type of beef roast, such as sirloin or rump, instead of buttock of beef.
- If you don't have game bird carcasses, you can use chicken or turkey carcasses as a substitute.
- If you prefer a vegetarian version, you can omit the meat and use vegetable broth instead of beef broth.
- The green lemon can be substituted with regular lemon or lime zest for a similar citrus flavor.

## Ingredients:
- 1.5 kg beef roast (such as sirloin or rump)
- Carcasses of 2 partridges (or chicken/turkey carcasses)
- 2 crusts of bread
- 500 ml strong gravy
- 1 liter beef broth (or vegetable broth for a vegetarian version)
- Salt, to taste
- Pepper, to taste
- 4 cloves
- 1 teaspoon dried thyme
- 1 teaspoon dried sweet basil
- Zest of 1 green lemon (or regular lemon/lime zest)

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 200Â°C.
2. Place the beef roast on a roasting pan and roast it until it is browned on all sides. This should take about 30 minutes.
3. Remove the browned parts of the beef roast and cut them off. Set them aside.
4. In a mortar, combine the browned beef parts, partridge carcasses, and bread crusts. Pound them together until they form a paste.
5. Transfer the paste to a stewpan.
6. Add the strong gravy and beef broth to the stewpan.
7. Season the mixture with salt, pepper, cloves, dried thyme, dried sweet basil, and the zest of a green lemon.
8. Place the stewpan over medium heat and bring the mixture to a boil.
9. Reduce the heat to low and let the mixture simmer for about 1 hour, stirring occasionally.
10. After 1 hour, strain the mixture through a fine-mesh sieve or cheesecloth to remove any solids. Press down on the solids to extract as much liquid as possible.
11. The strained liquid is the beef cullis and can be used immediately or stored in the refrigerator for later use.
