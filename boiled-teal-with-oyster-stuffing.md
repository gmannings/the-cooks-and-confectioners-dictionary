# Boiled Teal with Oyster Stuffing

## Description
This recipe is for boiling teal, a type of small wild duck. The teal is stuffed with a flavorful mixture of oysters, herbs, and butter, then boiled until tender. It is served on sippets (small pieces of toasted bread) with a gravy made from veal stock and orange juice. This dish is a classic example of 18th-century British cuisine.

## Ingredients:
- 2 large teal
- 12 large oysters
- 1 tablespoon sage, minced
- 1 tablespoon winter savory, minced
- 1 tablespoon thyme, minced
- 1 tablespoon parsley, minced
- 2 tablespoons butter
- 1 tablespoon flour
- Salt and pepper to taste
- 2 cups veal stock
- Juice of 2 oranges
- Lemon peel and parsley for garnish

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F).
2. Clean and truss the teal, removing any giblets or innards.
3. In a bowl, combine the minced sage, winter savory, thyme, and parsley.
4. Drain and chop the oysters into small pieces.
5. Add the chopped oysters to the bowl with the herbs.
6. Melt the butter in a small saucepan over low heat.
7. Add the flour to the melted butter and cook for 1-2 minutes, stirring constantly, to make a roux.
8. Add the roux to the bowl with the oysters and herbs.
9. Season the stuffing mixture with salt and pepper to taste and mix well.
10. Stuff the teal with the oyster stuffing, making sure to fill the cavity completely.
11. Tie the neck and vent of each teal closed with kitchen twine.
12. Bring a large pot of water to a boil.
13. Carefully place the teal in the boiling water and cook until tender, about 30-40 minutes.
14. While the teal is cooking, prepare the sauce. In a separate saucepan, heat the veal stock over medium heat.
15. Season the veal stock with salt and pepper to taste.
16. Squeeze the juice of the oranges into the veal stock and stir well.
17. Simmer the sauce for 10-15 minutes to allow the flavors to meld together.
18. Remove the teal from the boiling water and let it rest for a few minutes.
19. Slice the teal into serving portions.
20. Arrange sippets (small pieces of toasted bread) on a serving dish.
21. Place the sliced teal on top of the sippets.
22. Pour the veal stock and orange juice sauce over the teal.
23. Garnish the dish with lemon peel and parsley.
24. Serve the boiled teal with the oyster stuffing, gravy, and herbs.
