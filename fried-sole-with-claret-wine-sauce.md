# Fried Sole with Claret-Wine Sauce

## Description
This recipe is a modernized version of an 18th-century dish featuring fried sole served with a flavorful claret-wine sauce. The sole is first fried in sweet suet with spices and bay leaves, then simmered in a mixture of claret wine, anchovies, and butter. The dish is finished with a squeeze of lemon juice and garnished with orange or lemon slices.

## Ingredients:
- 2 large sole fillets
- 2 tablespoons sweet suet (or substitute vegetable oil)
- 1/2 teaspoon ground spice blend (such as a mix of cinnamon, nutmeg, and cloves)
- Salt to taste
- 2 bay leaves
- 1/2 cup claret wine (or substitute red wine)
- 4 anchovy fillets, finely chopped
- 2 tablespoons butter
- Juice of 1 lemon
- Orange or lemon slices, for garnish

## Instructions:
1. Heat a large frying pan over medium heat and add the sweet suet. If using vegetable oil, heat the oil until shimmering.
2. Season the sole fillets with salt and the ground spice blend on both sides.
3. Place the sole fillets in the frying pan and fry them until golden brown on both sides, about 2-3 minutes per side. Remove the fillets from the pan and set them aside on a plate.
4. In the same frying pan, add the bay leaves, claret wine, chopped anchovies, and butter. Stir well to combine.
5. Place the fried sole fillets back into the pan, ensuring they are submerged in the sauce. If needed, add a little more wine or water to cover the fish.
6. Cover the pan with a lid or a second dish and place it over a low heat source, such as a chafing dish or a low burner. Let the fish simmer in the sauce for about 5-7 minutes, or until the fish is cooked through and the flavors have melded together.
7. Remove the lid or second dish and squeeze the juice of one lemon over the fish and sauce. Stir gently to incorporate the lemon juice.
8. Transfer the fried sole fillets to a serving dish, spoon the claret-wine sauce over them, and garnish with orange or lemon slices.
9. Serve the fried sole with claret-wine sauce immediately.
