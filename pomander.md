# Pomander

## Description
A pomander is a scented ball made from a mixture of aromatic substances. It was traditionally used to ward off unpleasant odors and to provide a pleasant fragrance. This recipe calls for Benjamin (benzoin), Labdanum, and Storax, which are all resinous substances with strong scents. The mixture is formed into small beads and strung together to create a decorative and fragrant accessory.

## Ingredients:
- 28 grams Benjamin (benzoin)
- 28 grams Labdanum
- 28 grams Storax
- 4 grains Civet
- 6 grains Musk

## Instructions:
1. Preheat a mortar by placing it in a hot oven for a few minutes.
2. Remove the mortar from the oven and add the Benjamin, Labdanum, and Storax to it.
3. Using a pestle, vigorously pound and grind the ingredients in the hot mortar until they form a smooth paste. The heat will help soften the resins and make them easier to work with.
4. Once the paste is smooth, add the Civet and Musk to the mortar and continue grinding until they are well incorporated.
5. Take small portions of the paste and roll them into small beads between your palms. The size of the beads is up to your preference, but aim for uniformity.
6. While the beads are still warm and pliable, use a needle or skewer to make a hole through the center of each bead.
7. String the beads onto a thread or thin cord, making sure to leave enough space between each bead.
8. Allow the pomander to dry completely before using or displaying it.

## Cooking time
N/A (Drying time may vary depending on the environment, but it typically takes a few days for the pomander beads to fully dry and harden.)
