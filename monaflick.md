## Description
Monaflick is a traditional 18th-century dish made with rice, gravy, herbs, poultry, bacon, and forcemeat balls. It is a hearty and flavorful dish that combines various ingredients to create a delicious and satisfying meal.

## Options and commentary
- You can use chicken or turkey instead of a fat pullet.
- If you don't have access to oysters, you can omit them or substitute with mushrooms.
- Forcemeat balls can be made with a mixture of ground meat, breadcrumbs, herbs, and spices.
- The dish can be garnished with grated bread and lemon zest for added flavor and presentation.

## Ingredients:
- 1 quart (950 ml) rice
- 2 quarts (1.9 liters) good gravy
- 1 faggot of sweet herbs (such as thyme, rosemary, and parsley)
- 2 onions, stuck with cloves
- 1 fat pullet (or chicken/turkey)
- Forcemeat mixture (ground meat, breadcrumbs, herbs, spices)
- Oysters (optional)
- 1/2 pound (225 g) bacon
- 3 eggs, yolks only
- 1/4 pound (113 g) butter, rolled up in flour
- Juice of 1 lemon
- Grated bread and lemon zest for garnish

## Instructions:
1. In a large pot, combine the rice and gravy. Place the pot over medium heat and bring it to a simmer. Do not let it boil.
2. Add the faggot of sweet herbs and the onions stuck with cloves to the pot. Stir to combine.
3. Prepare the forcemeat mixture by combining ground meat, breadcrumbs, herbs, and spices in a bowl. Mix well.
4. Stuff the belly of the fat pullet with the forcemeat mixture and oysters (if using).
5. Add the stuffed pullet, bacon, and forcemeat balls to the pot with the rice and gravy. Make sure they are submerged in the liquid.
6. Reduce the heat to low and let the dish simmer gently for about 1-2 hours, or until the meat is tender and the consistency is thickened, similar to a hasty pudding.
7. In the meantime, fry some additional forcemeat balls in a separate pan until golden brown.
8. In a small bowl, beat the egg yolks with the rolled-up butter and lemon juice.
9. Once the dish is cooked, carefully remove the stuffed pullet, bacon, and forcemeat balls from the pot and transfer them to a serving dish.
10. Pour the egg yolk mixture into the pot with the rice and gravy. Stir well to combine and thicken the sauce.
11. Pour the thickened sauce over the stuffed pullet, bacon, and forcemeat balls in the serving dish.
12. Garnish the brims of the dish with grated bread and lemon zest.
13. Serve the Monaflick hot and enjoy!
