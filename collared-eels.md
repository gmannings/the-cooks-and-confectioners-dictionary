# Collared Eels

## Description
Collared eels are a traditional dish where eels are skinned, gutted, and rolled up with a flavorful seasoning. They are then boiled in a pickle made from the eel bones, herbs, and cider. The collared eels are served cold and can be enjoyed with a variety of condiments such as vinegar and oil, lemon juice, or pickles.

## Ingredients:
- 4 eels, skinned and gutted
- Pepper
- Salt
- Nutmeg
- Fresh herbs (such as parsley, thyme, or dill)
- Lemon peel
- 2-3 bay leaves
- A sprig of rosemary
- Cider
- Vinegar
- Oil
- Pickles (optional)

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F).

2. Lay the eels flat on a cutting board and carefully remove the bones. To do this, make a shallow incision along the belly of each eel and gently pull out the bones. 

3. Season the eels with pepper, salt, nutmeg, chopped fresh herbs, and grated lemon peel.

4. Roll up each eel tightly and secure with kitchen twine or tape.

5. In a large pot, place the eel bones and cover with water. Add pepper, salt, bay leaves, rosemary, and a bunch of fresh herbs. Pour in enough cider to cover the bones.

6. Bring the pot to a boil and simmer for about 10 minutes. Be careful not to overcook the bones.

7. Remove the bones from the pot and tie them together in a bunch. Hang them up to cool.

8. Skim off any fat from the liquid in the pot and return it to the stove.

9. Add the rolled eels to the pot and bring the liquid to a boil. Reduce the heat and simmer for about 30 minutes, or until the eels are cooked through.

10. While the eels are cooking, prepare a thick dressing by whisking together vinegar and oil, or lemon juice.

11. Once the eels are cooked, remove them from the pot and allow them to cool.

12. Once cooled, remove the twine or tape from the eels and slice them into rounds.

13. Serve the collared eels cold with the dressing and optional pickles.
