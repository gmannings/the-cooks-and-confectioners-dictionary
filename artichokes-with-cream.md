# Artichokes with Cream

## Description
This recipe is for a creamy and flavorful dish featuring boiled artichokes. The artichokes are cooked in water and then tossed with butter, cream, parsley, and chives. The sauce is thickened with egg yolk, resulting in a rich and indulgent dish.

## Ingredients:
- 4 artichokes
- 2 tablespoons butter
- 1 cup cream
- 1 bunch parsley, chopped
- 1 bunch chives, chopped
- Salt, to taste
- Nutmeg, to taste
- 1 egg yolk

## Instructions:
1. Fill a large pot with water and bring it to a boil.
2. Meanwhile, prepare the artichokes by trimming off the tough outer leaves and cutting off the top third of each artichoke.
3. Once the water is boiling, add the artichokes and cook them until they are tender. This will take about 30-40 minutes.
4. While the artichokes are cooking, melt the butter in a stew-pan over medium heat.
5. Add the cream, parsley, and chives to the stew-pan and stir to combine.
6. Season the sauce with salt and nutmeg to taste.
7. In a small bowl, whisk the egg yolk until smooth.
8. Gradually add a spoonful of the hot cream sauce to the egg yolk, whisking constantly to temper the yolk and prevent it from curdling.
9. Slowly pour the tempered egg yolk mixture into the stew-pan, stirring constantly.
10. Continue to cook the sauce over low heat, stirring constantly, until it thickens slightly.
11. Once the artichokes are cooked, remove them from the pot and drain any excess water.
12. Place the artichokes in the stew-pan with the cream sauce and toss them gently to coat.
13. Transfer the artichokes and sauce to plates or small dishes.
14. Serve the artichokes with cream immediately.
