# Boiled Lood-Cocks

## Description
Boiled Lood-Cocks is a dish made from boiled cocks (roosters) served with a flavorful sauce. The cocks are boiled in either strong broth or water with salt, then the guts and livers are minced and mixed with grated bread, broth, and mace. The mixture is stewed with gravy, and a sauce is made by dissolving eggs in wine-vinegar and grated nutmeg. The sauce is then combined with butter and served over the boiled cocks, which are placed on sippets (toasted bread). The dish can be garnished with capers, lemon, minced barberries, or white pickled grapes. Optionally, sliced lemons can be boiled with the sauce, and currants can be boiled in broth separately. If onions are used, the bottom of the serving dish should be rubbed with garlic.

## Options and commentary
- Instead of lood-cocks, you can use chicken or any other poultry of your choice.
- You can adjust the amount of grated bread, broth, and mace according to your taste preferences.
- The sauce can be customized with additional herbs or spices.
- The garnishes can be varied based on personal preference.

## Ingredients:
- 1 cock (rooster) or chicken
- Strong broth or water
- Salt
- Guts and livers of the cock/chicken
- Grated bread
- Large mace
- Gravy
- 2 eggs
- Wine-vinegar
- Grated nutmeg
- Butter
- Sippets (toasted bread)
- Optional garnishes: capers, lemon, minced barberries, white pickled grapes

## Instructions:
1. In a large pot, bring the strong broth or water to a boil. Add salt to taste.
2. Carefully place the cock or chicken into the boiling liquid. Cook until fully cooked through, following the recommended cooking time for poultry. Remove from the pot and set aside to cool slightly.
3. Once the cock or chicken has cooled, remove the guts and livers. Mince them finely.
4. In a separate saucepan, combine the minced guts and livers with grated bread, a little of the broth from boiling, and a sprinkle of large mace.
5. Add gravy to the saucepan and stir everything together. Simmer over low heat for a few minutes to allow the flavors to meld.
6. In a small bowl, dissolve the eggs in wine-vinegar and grated nutmeg.
7. Just before serving, melt some butter in a saucepan. Pour in the egg mixture and stir continuously until the sauce thickens slightly.
8. Place the boiled cock or chicken on sippets (toasted bread) on a serving dish.
9. Pour the sauce over the boiled cock or chicken.
10. Garnish with capers, lemon slices, minced barberries, or white pickled grapes, if desired.
11. Optionally, if boiled sliced lemons are desired, boil them separately and add them to the sauce.
12. Optionally, if boiled currants are desired, boil them in broth separately.
13. If using onions, rub the bottom of the serving dish with garlic before placing the boiled cock or chicken on top.

## Cooking time
Approximately 1-2 hours, depending on the size of the cock or chicken.
