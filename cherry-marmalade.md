# Cherry Marmalade

## Description
This recipe is for making a delicious cherry marmalade. The cherries are cooked, drained, and then mashed before being mixed with sugar and simmered to create a thick and sweet spread. This marmalade can be enjoyed on toast, scones, or used as a filling for pastries.

## Ingredients:
- 1 kg cherries, pitted
- 1 kg sugar

## Instructions:
1. Stone the cherries by removing the pits. You can use a cherry pitter or carefully cut around the pit with a knife.
2. Place the pitted cherries in a preserving pan or a large saucepan.
3. Set the pan over medium heat and cook the cherries until they release their juice. This will help to concentrate the flavor.
4. Once the cherries have released their juice, remove them from the heat and drain them. You can use a colander or a sieve to separate the cherries from the juice.
5. Bruise the cherries by mashing them with a fork or a potato masher. This will help to break them down and create a smoother texture.
6. Pass the mashed cherries through a sieve to remove any remaining skins or solids. This will result in a smoother marmalade.
7. Return the cherry marmalade to the preserving pan or saucepan.
8. Place the pan over medium heat again and add the sugar. The ratio of sugar to cherry marmalade should be 1:1, so if you have 1 kg of cherries, you will need 1 kg of sugar.
9. Stir the mixture well to combine the sugar with the cherry marmalade.
10. Allow the mixture to simmer for some time, stirring occasionally to prevent sticking or burning. The exact cooking time will depend on the desired thickness of the marmalade. You can test the consistency by placing a small amount on a chilled plate and checking if it sets.
11. Once the marmalade has reached the desired thickness, remove it from the heat.
12. Prepare clean, sterilized jars for storing the marmalade. You can do this by washing the jars and lids in hot, soapy water and then placing them in a preheated oven at 120Â°C for 10 minutes.
13. While the jars are still hot, carefully ladle the cherry marmalade into them, leaving a small amount of headspace at the top.
14. Sprinkle a little sugar on top of the marmalade in each jar. This will help to preserve it and create a nice texture.
15. Seal the jars tightly with the lids and allow them to cool completely before storing them in a cool, dark place.

## Cooking time
Approximately 1-2 hours, depending on desired thickness.
