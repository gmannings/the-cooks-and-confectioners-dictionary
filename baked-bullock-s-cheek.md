# Baked Bullock's Cheek

## Description
This recipe is for baking a bullock's cheek and serving it hot. The cheek is stuffed with parsley and herbs, then cooked in a mixture of strong beer, claret wine, and whole spices. Once baked, the bones are removed and the cheek is served on toasted bread with some of the cooking liquid.

## Ingredients:
- 1 bullock's cheek
- Fresh parsley
- Fresh herbs (such as thyme, rosemary, or sage)
- 1 cup strong beer
- 1 cup claret wine
- Whole spices (such as cloves, peppercorns, or bay leaves)
- Salt
- Toasted bread slices

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F).
2. Clean the bullock's cheek thoroughly, removing any excess fat or gristle.
3. Finely chop a handful of fresh parsley and a selection of fresh herbs.
4. Stuff the cheek with the chopped parsley and herbs, ensuring it is evenly distributed.
5. In a large pan or casserole dish, combine the strong beer, claret wine, and a selection of whole spices. You can use about 1 teaspoon of each spice.
6. Season the liquid with salt to taste.
7. Place the stuffed bullock's cheek into the pan with the liquid.
8. Cover the pan or dish with a lid or aluminum foil.
9. Bake in the preheated oven for approximately 3-4 hours, or until the cheek is tender and cooked through. Baste the cheek with the cooking liquid occasionally during the cooking process.
10. Once the cheek is cooked, remove it from the pan and carefully remove the bones.
11. Slice the cheek into thick slices.
12. Serve the sliced cheek on toasted bread slices, drizzling some of the cooking liquid over the top.
