# Dzel'd Loin of Mutton

## Description
Dzel'd Loin of Mutton is a traditional 18th-century dish made by layering bacon, veal, onions, and mutton in a stew-pan, seasoning it with salt, spices, and herbs, and then cooking it either between two fires or in an oven. After cooking, the mutton is breaded and broiled on a gridiron. It is served with a sauce called Ramolade, made with chives, parsley, capers, anchovies, garlic, and gravy.
