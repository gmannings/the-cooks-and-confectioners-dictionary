# Fried Mushrooms

## Description
This recipe is for frying mushrooms and serving them as a side dish or garnish. The mushrooms are first tossed in broth to remove any bitterness, then seasoned with salt, pepper, and flour before being fried in butter or lard. They can be served with beef steaks, lemon juice, and parsley as an accompaniment or used as a garnish.

## Ingredients:
- Mushrooms
- Broth (beef, fish, or vegetable)
- Salt
- Pepper
- Flour
- Butter or lard
- Beef steaks (optional)
- Lemon juice (optional)
- Parsley (optional)

## Instructions:
1. Clean the mushrooms by wiping them with a damp cloth or brushing off any dirt. Trim the stems if necessary.
2. In a stewpan, toss the mushrooms with enough broth to coat them. This will help remove any bitterness from the mushrooms.
3. Sprinkle salt, pepper, and flour over the mushrooms, ensuring they are evenly coated.
4. Heat butter or lard in a frying pan over medium heat.
5. Add the coated mushrooms to the pan and fry them until they are golden brown and crispy. This will take about 5-7 minutes.
6. If using, cook the beef steaks according to your preferred method.
7. Serve the fried mushrooms as a side dish alongside the beef steaks. Squeeze lemon juice over the mushrooms and garnish with chopped parsley, if desired.

## Cooking time
Approximately 5-7 minutes for frying the mushrooms. Cooking time for the beef steaks will vary depending on the desired level of doneness.
