# Burnt Cream

## Description
Burnt Cream, also known as Crème Brûlée, is a classic French dessert consisting of a rich custard base topped with a layer of caramelized sugar. The custard is creamy and smooth, while the caramelized sugar adds a delightful crunch and sweetness.

## Options and commentary
- You can add a splash of vanilla extract or scrape a vanilla bean into the custard for added flavor.
- For a twist, you can infuse the milk with other flavors such as lavender, cardamom, or citrus zest.
- Instead of using a fire-shovel to brown the cream, you can use a kitchen torch or place the custard under a broiler for a few minutes.

## Ingredients:
- 4-5 egg yolks
- 1 tablespoon flour
- 1 liter milk
- 1 small stick of cinnamon
- Candied lemon peel
- Green lemon peel
- Sugar (for caramelizing)

## Instructions:
1. In a stew-pan, beat the egg yolks well with the flour until smooth.
2. Gradually pour in the milk, stirring constantly, until you have a quart of mixture.
3. Add the small stick of cinnamon, candied lemon peel, and green lemon peel cut into small pieces.
4. Place the stew-pan on the stove over low heat.
5. Stir the mixture continuously to prevent it from sticking to the bottom of the pan.
6. Once the mixture comes to a boil, place a dish on the stove and pour the cream into it.
7. Let the cream boil again until it starts to stick to the sides of the dish.
8. Remove the dish from the heat and sprinkle a generous amount of sugar on top of the cream.
9. Heat a fire-shovel until it is red hot.
10. Carefully hold the fire-shovel above the cream and move it back and forth to brown the sugar and create a golden color.
11. Allow the burnt cream to cool before serving.
