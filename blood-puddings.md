# Blood Puddings

## Description
Blood puddings are a traditional dish made from a mixture of oatmeal, milk, beef suet, herbs, cream, and blood from a hog or sheep. The mixture is stuffed into cleaned ox or hog guts and then boiled. The puddings can be fried or boiled before serving.

## Options and commentary
- Instead of using ox or hog guts, you can use sausage casings or synthetic casings.
- You can add additional herbs and spices to suit your taste.
- You can mix half blood puddings and half marrow puddings for a variation.

## Ingredients:
- 1 liter milk
- 250 grams oatmeal
- 300 grams beef suet, finely shredded
- Salt and pepper to taste

- Handful of fresh parsley, finely chopped
- Handful of fresh pennyroyal, finely chopped
- 250 ml cream
- 750 ml blood from a hog or sheep
- Sausage casings or synthetic casings

## Instructions:
1. In a large pot, bring the milk to a boil.
2. Add the oatmeal to the boiling milk and stir well.
3. Remove from heat and let it stand overnight to swell.

5. Add the oatmeal mixture, cream, and blood to the bowl. Mix well until all the ingredients are thoroughly combined.
6. Warm the mixture over low heat for a few minutes, stirring continuously.
7. Clean the sausage casings or synthetic casings thoroughly, removing any excess fat or debris.
8. Make a small funnel with a tail about five inches long out of the casing material.
9. Cut the casings into one-yard lengths.
10. Fill the casings with the blood pudding mixture, leaving some space for expansion. Do not overfill.
11. Tie one end of each filled casing with kitchen twine.
12. Tie the two ends of each casing together, creating two separate puddings in each piece.
13. Bring a large pot of water to a boil.
14. Gently place the tied blood puddings into the boiling water and cook for 15 minutes.
15. Remove the puddings from the pot and place them in a colander to cool.
