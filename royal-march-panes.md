# Royal March-panes

## Description
Royal March-panes are a type of almond-based pastry that were popular in the 18th century. They are made by blanching and pounding almonds, then mixing them with orange flower water and egg white to form a pliable paste. The paste is then rolled out, cut into lengths, and shaped into rings or wreaths. The rings are dipped in apricot marmalade and rolled in powdered sugar before being baked in a campaign oven. The result is a delicate, sweet pastry with a puff in the middle and adorned with small round pellets of paste or fruit.

## Ingredients:
- Almonds
- Orange flower water
- Egg white
- Powdered sugar
- Marmalade of apricots
- Small round pellets of paste or fruit (such as raspberry or cherry)

## Instructions:
1. Blanch the almonds by placing them in boiling water for a few minutes, then drain and remove the skins.
2. Pound the blanched almonds in a mortar and pestle until finely ground.
3. Moisten the ground almonds with orange flower water and mix in the egg white to form a pliable paste.
4. Dust a clean surface with powdered sugar and roll out the almond paste to the thickness of a finger.
5. Cut the rolled-out paste into lengths that are suitable for making rings or wreaths.
6. Take each length of paste and shape it into a ring or wreath by wrapping it around your finger. Close the two ends so that they can be separated again.
7. In a small bowl, mix a spoonful of apricot marmalade with the egg white.
8. Dip each ring or wreath into the marmalade mixture, ensuring it is fully coated.
9. Roll the coated rings or wreaths in powdered sugar, making sure they are well coated. If there is excess sugar, gently blow it off.
10. Place the coated rings or wreaths on a sheet of white paper.
11. Preheat the oven to the recommended temperature for a campaign oven (if available).
12. Bake the rings or wreaths in the preheated oven with fire at the top and bottom. This will ensure that they are iced on both sides at the same time.
13. Bake until the pastries are golden brown and a puff in the shape of a coronet has formed in the middle.
14. While the pastries are cooling, decorate the void spaces of the rings or wreaths with small round pellets of paste or fruit, such as raspberry or cherry.

## Cooking time
The cooking time will vary depending on the oven and the size of the pastries. It is recommended to bake them until they are golden brown and a puff in the shape of a coronet has formed in the middle. This could take approximately 15-20 minutes.
