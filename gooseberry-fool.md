# Gooseberry Fool

## Description
Gooseberry Fool is a classic English dessert made with cooked gooseberries, sugar, cream, and eggs. It has a smooth and creamy texture with a tangy and sweet flavor. This recipe yields a rich and indulgent fool that can be enjoyed cold.

## Ingredients:
- 1 kg gooseberries
- 1 liter water
- 300 grams fine sugar
- 375 ml cream
- 8 egg yolks

## Instructions:
1. Rinse the gooseberries and remove any stems or leaves.
2. In a large saucepan, combine the gooseberries and water. Bring to a boil over medium heat and cook until the gooseberries are tender.
3. Mash the cooked gooseberries in the water until they form a thick puree.
4. Add the fine sugar to the gooseberry puree and stir well. Continue to cook over low heat until the mixture thickens to a syrup-like consistency.
5. In a separate bowl, whisk together the cream and egg yolks until well combined.
6. Slowly pour the cream and egg mixture into the gooseberry puree, stirring continuously.
7. Continue to cook the mixture over low heat, stirring constantly, until it thickens and coats the back of a spoon. Be careful not to let it boil.
8. Once the fool has thickened, remove it from the heat and let it cool slightly.
9. Pour the fool into a deep dish or individual serving bowls.
10. Refrigerate the fool until it is completely chilled, for at least 2 hours.
11. Serve the gooseberry fool cold.
