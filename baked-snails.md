# Baked Snails

## Description
This recipe is for a traditional 18th-century dish of baked snails. The snails are boiled, seasoned, and then baked in a pie with various ingredients such as marrow, chicken, lard, bacon, herbs, butter, and slices of orange or lemon. The pie is then glazed with a mixture of white wine and butter.

## Ingredients:
- 500g snails
- 200g all-purpose flour
- Salt, to taste
- Pepper, to taste
- Nutmeg, to taste
- 100g marrow, diced
- 1 raw chicken, cut into pieces
- 100g lard, cut into small pieces
- 100g bacon, boneless and cut into small pieces
- 1 tsp whole mace
- 2 tbsp savory herbs, finely chopped
- 50g butter, diced

- 100ml white wine
- 50g butter, melted

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F).

2. In a large pot, bring water to a boil and add the snails. Boil the snails for 10 minutes to remove any impurities. Drain the snails and set aside.

3. In a mixing bowl, combine the flour, salt, pepper, and nutmeg. Mix well.

4. Roll the boiled snails in the seasoned flour mixture until they are coated evenly.

5. In a deep pie dish, layer the coated snails, diced marrow, chicken pieces, lard, bacon, whole mace, savory herbs, butter, and slices of orange or lemon.

6. Continue layering until all the ingredients are used, making sure to finish with a layer of snails on top.

7. Cover the pie dish with a pastry lid or a sheet of aluminum foil, sealing the edges tightly.

8. Place the pie dish in the preheated oven and bake for 1 hour.

9. After 1 hour, remove the pie dish from the oven and carefully remove the pastry lid or foil.

10. Pour the white wine over the pie and brush the melted butter on top.

11. Return the pie to the oven and bake for an additional 15 minutes, or until the top is golden brown and the filling is cooked through.

12. Remove the pie from the oven and let it cool for a few minutes before serving.
