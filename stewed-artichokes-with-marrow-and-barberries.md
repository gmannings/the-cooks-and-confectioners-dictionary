# Stewed Artichokes with Marrow and Barberries

## Description
This recipe is a modernized version of a dish from the 18th century cookbook. It features tender artichoke bottoms stewed with marrow, preserved plums, and a hint of sweetness from sugar. The dish is garnished with tangy barberries, adding a pop of color and flavor. It is a unique and flavorful side dish that can be served with roasted meats or enjoyed on its own.

## Ingredients:
- 4 artichokes
- 4 slices of white bread
- 100g marrow (or substitute with butter)
- 4 blades of mace
- 100g preserved plums (or substitute with prunes)
- 1/4 cup verjuice (or substitute with white wine vinegar)
- 2 tablespoons sugar
- 1/4 cup barberries (for garnish)

## Instructions:
1. Fill a large pot with water and bring it to a boil.
2. While the water is boiling, prepare the artichokes by removing the tough outer leaves and cutting off the top third of each artichoke.
3. Place the artichokes in the boiling water and cook for about 20 minutes, or until they are tender when pierced with a fork.
4. Once the artichokes are cooked, remove them from the pot and let them cool slightly.
5. Cut the artichokes in half and remove the fuzzy choke from the center.
6. Cut the artichoke bottoms into quarters and split them in the middle.
7. Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F).
8. Take a stew-pan or a casserole dish and line the bottom with the slices of white bread.
9. Place the artichoke quarters on top of the bread slices.
10. Cut the marrow into small pieces and distribute them evenly among the artichokes.
11. Sprinkle the blades of mace over the artichokes.
12. Add the preserved plums (or prunes) along with their juice to the stew-pan.
13. Pour the verjuice (or white wine vinegar) over the artichokes.
14. Sprinkle the sugar evenly over the dish.
15. Cover the stew-pan with a lid or aluminum foil and place it in the preheated oven.
16. Let the artichokes stew in the oven for about 2 hours, or until they are tender and the flavors have melded together.
17. Once the stewing time is up, remove the stew-pan from the oven and carefully transfer the artichokes to a serving dish.
18. Garnish the artichokes with barberries.
19. Serve the stewed artichokes with marrow and barberries as a side dish or as a main course.
