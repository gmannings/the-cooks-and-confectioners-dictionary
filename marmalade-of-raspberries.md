# Marmalade of Raspberries

## Description
This recipe is for making a marmalade using raspberries and currants. The currants are used as the base, with a handful of raspberries added to give the appearance of a raspberry-only marmalade. The currants are cooked, strained, and then mixed with sugar to create a sweet and tart spread.

## Ingredients:
- 500g currants
- 100g raspberries
- 500g sugar

## Instructions:
1. Strip the currants from the bunches and place them in a bowl.
2. Pour boiling water over the currants and let them soak until they break apart.
3. Remove the currants from the water and drain them in a sieve. Allow them to cool.
4. Once cooled, pass the currants through the sieve to separate the syrup from the grains.
5. Transfer the currant syrup to a saucepan and cook it over low heat until it thickens, following the usual method for making marmalade.
6. Meanwhile, in a separate saucepan, heat the sugar until it reaches the "crack" stage (approximately 150°C/300°F).
7. Once the currant syrup has thickened and the sugar has reached the desired temperature, mix them together.
8. Add the raspberries to the mixture and let it simmer for a short time.
9. Sprinkle the marmalade with sugar and transfer it to pots or jars for storage.

## Cooking time
Approximately 1-2 hours, depending on the desired thickness of the marmalade.
