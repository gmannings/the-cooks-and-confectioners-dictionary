# Pippin Tanfy

## Description
Pippin Tanfy is a traditional 18th-century dish made with sliced apples (Pippins) cooked in a sweet and creamy custard mixture. It is fried in a pan until golden and served with melted butter and sugar.

## Options and commentary
- You can use any type of tart apple as a substitute for Pippins.
- If you don't have Juice of Tanfey or Juice of Spinage, you can use apple juice and spinach juice as alternatives.
- Adjust the amount of sugar according to your taste preference.
