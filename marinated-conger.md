# Marinated Conger

## Description
This recipe is for marinated conger, a type of fish. The fish is cut into pieces and fried in clarified butter before being marinated in a mixture of white wine vinegar, salt, and spices. The marinated fish is then covered and left to infuse the flavors.

## Options and commentary
- Conger can be substituted with any firm white fish, such as cod or haddock.
