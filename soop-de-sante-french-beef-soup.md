# Soop de Sante (French Beef Soup)

## Description
Soop de Sante is a traditional French beef soup that is rich and flavorful. It is made by simmering beef, veal, and chicken in a broth until it becomes jelly-like in consistency. The soup is then served with a garnish of herbs and vegetables. 

## Options and commentary
- You can use any cut of beef for this recipe, but it is recommended to use a cut with some fat and connective tissue for added flavor.
- If you don't have a knuckle of veal, you can use beef bones or additional beef for the broth.
- The pullet can be replaced with chicken or omitted altogether if desired.
- The garnish can be customized based on your preference. Endive, celery, carrots, and forcemeat are all traditional options.
- The cooking time for this recipe is approximately 3-4 hours.

## Ingredients:
- 2 kg beef (preferably with some fat and connective tissue)
- Salt
- Spices (such as black pepper, cloves, and thyme)
- 1 knuckle of veal (or beef bones)
- 1 pullet (or chicken)
- 200 g bacon
- 50 g butter
- 600 g veal or beef fillet (or buttock of beef), sliced
- 3-4 onions, sliced
- 2 turnips, diced
- 1 carrot, diced
- Whole cloves
- Fresh thyme
- Fresh parsley
- Mushrooms (optional)
- 1 cabbage lettuce or charvil
- Sorrel
- Endive
- Celery
- 2 French rolls (or French bread)
- Forcemeat (optional)
- Boiled carrot (optional)

## Instructions:
1. Season the beef with salt and spices.
2. Blanch the knuckle of veal by placing it in a pot of boiling water for a few minutes, then remove and set aside.
3. In a large pot, boil the beef until the broth becomes strong and flavorful. Strain the broth and set aside.
4. Place the knuckle of veal and the pullet (or chicken) into the beef broth. Boil them in the broth until it reaches a jelly-like consistency.
5. While the meat is boiling, stick cloves into a piece of bacon.
6. In a separate stewpan, layer the bacon and butter at the bottom. Arrange the sliced veal or beef on top of the bacon, covering the bottom of the stewpan.
7. Place the stewpan over a moderate fire and cook for 1.5 hours, allowing it to gently color. When it starts to crack, add a little fat from the boiling broth, but avoid stirring too much to prevent thickening.
8. Add the sliced onions, diced turnips, diced carrot, whole cloves, thyme, parsley, and mushrooms (if using) to the stewpan. Fry them together until they are a good brown color.
9. Pour as much of the broth from the knuckle of veal and pullet as you can spare into the stewpan, leaving enough to keep the veal and pullet white. Soak bread in the broth to use in the soup.
10. In the meantime, make a pan of good gravy by boiling the crusts of two French rolls with three pints of gravy. Strain the mixture through a sieve and add it to the boiled herbs.
11. Alternatively, you can thicken the gravy with a piece of butter, browned over the fire with a handful of flour and a minced onion. Add some gravy to the browned mixture and let it boil for a little while. Strain it through a sieve and add it to the boiled herbs.
12. When the herbs are tender, add the thickening mixture. Let everything boil together for half an hour, then skim off any fat.
13. In the bottom of a soup dish, place slices of French bread or dried crusts. Set the dish over a chafing dish of coals and boil it up in some of the broth.
14. Place the pullet and herbs on top of the bread and garnish with a rim of endive or celery boiled in good broth, cut into pieces about three inches long. Alternatively, garnish with forcemeat and boiled carrot. Ensure there is no fat on the dish.
15. Serve the Soop de Sante hot.
