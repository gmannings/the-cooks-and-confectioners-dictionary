- If you don't have access to all the herbs and roots mentioned in the original recipe, you can use a combination of those that are available to you.
- Instead of boiling the ingredients in water, you can use a nut milk bag or cheesecloth to steep the herbs and roots in water for a few hours to extract their flavors.
- You can sweeten the almond milk with honey or any other sweetener of your choice.
