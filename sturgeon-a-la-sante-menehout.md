# Sturgeon a la Sante Menehout

## Description
Sturgeon a la Sante Menehout is a dish made with thick slices of sturgeon that are first stewed in a mixture of milk, white wine, melted lard, and seasonings. The sturgeon slices are then coated with grated bread and grilled. The dish is served with a flavorful sauce made with anchovies, capers, chibbols (spring onions), parsley, good gravy, garlic, and a drop of oil.

## Ingredients:
- 1 sturgeon fillet, cut into thick slices
- 500 ml milk
- 250 ml white wine

- 250 ml good gravy

- 1 tablespoon oil

## Instructions:
1. In a large saucepan, combine the milk, white wine, melted lard, bay leaf, salt, and pepper. Bring to a simmer over medium heat.
