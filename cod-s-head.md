# Cod's Head

## Description
This recipe is for cooking a cod's head in a flavorful broth and serving it with a rich sauce made from white wine, anchovies, and lobster. The head is tied up to keep it together and is boiled in a mixture of water and vinegar with spices and onions. After boiling, the head is drained and served with the sauce, along with fried shrimps and fish.

## Options and commentary
- Instead of using a whole cod's head, you can use cod fillets or another type of white fish.
- Adjust the amount of spices and seasoning according to your taste preferences.
- Serve the dish with boiled potatoes or steamed vegetables for a complete meal.

## Ingredients:
- 1 cod's head (or cod fillets)
- 1 pint (473 ml) vinegar
- Water (enough to cover the cod's head)
- Whole pepper
- Mace
- Fresh herbs (such as parsley, thyme, or bay leaves)
- 3 onions, quartered
- Salt
- 1 pint (473 ml) white wine
- Almost 1 pint (473 ml) water
- 6 anchovies
- Nutmeg
- 1 large onion
- 1 lemon
- 1 cod's liver (optional)
- 1 pound (454 g) butter
- Flour
- Vinegar or lemon juice
- Lobster body (cooked and chopped)
- Oysters
- Shrimps
- Flatfish (fried)

## Instructions:
1. Wash the cod's head (or fillets) thoroughly and remove any impurities.
2. Tie the cod's head with a broad filletting to keep it together during cooking. If using fillets, skip this step.
3. In a large pot, combine the water and vinegar in a ratio that is enough to cover the cod's head (or fillets).
4. Add whole pepper, mace, fresh herbs, and the quartered onions to the pot.
5. Bring the liquid to a boil.
6. Add a handful of salt to the boiling liquid and skim off any impurities that rise to the surface.
7. Once the liquid tastes well-seasoned, carefully place the cod's head (or fillets) into the pot.
8. Reduce the heat to a simmer and cook for about 30 minutes or until the cod's head (or fillets) are cooked through. If using fillets, adjust the cooking time accordingly.
9. Remove the cod's head (or fillets) from the pot and place it in a dish over a chafing-dish of coals to drain. Prick the head and eyes to let out any excess liquid and use a sponge to wipe away the remaining liquid.
10. In a separate saucepan, combine the white wine, water, anchovies, whole pepper, mace, nutmeg, large onion (quartered), and a bit of lemon.
11. Dissolve and strain the anchovies in the saucepan.
12. If using, bruise the cod's liver and add it to the saucepan.
13. Add the body of a cooked lobster and the butter to the saucepan.
14. Work a bit of butter with a little flour to create a roux-like mixture. This will help thicken the sauce and ensure it is all of a consistent color.
15. Add vinegar or lemon juice to the saucepan, along with the rest of the lobster (cut into dice), oysters, and shrimps.
16. Fry and scald some shrimps separately, and fry some flatfish to serve around the cod's head.
17. Serve the cod's head (or fillets) with the sauce, fried shrimps, and flatfish.
