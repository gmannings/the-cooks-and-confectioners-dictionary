# Frically Plaice

## Description
Frically Plaice is a dish made with plaice fillets that are cut into collops, seasoned, and cooked in a flavorful sauce made with butter, white wine, oyster liquor, crab meat, oysters, nutmeg, thyme, and anchovies. The dish is served on sippets (toasted bread) and garnished with hard-boiled egg yolks and slices of orange.

## Ingredients:
- 4 plaice fillets
- Salt, to taste
- Flour, for dusting
- 4 tablespoons clarified butter
- 1 ladle of butter
- 1/2 cup white wine
- 1/2 cup oyster liquor
- Meat of 2-3 crabs
- 6-8 oysters
- 1/2 teaspoon grated nutmeg
- 1 teaspoon minced thyme
- 2-3 anchovies
- Sippets (toasted bread), for serving
- Hard-boiled egg yolks, sliced, for garnish
- Orange slices, for garnish

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F).

2. Using a sharp knife, run it along the backside of each plaice fillet to remove the bone. Divide the flesh on both sides from head to tail. Cut the fillets into three or four collops, depending on their size.

3. Pat the collops dry with paper towels and lightly season them with salt. Dust them with flour, shaking off any excess.

4. In a large skillet, heat the clarified butter over high heat until very hot. Add the plaice collops and cook them for about 2-3 minutes on each side, or until they are almost cooked through. Remove the collops from the skillet and keep them warm by placing them in a preheated oven.

5. Clean the skillet and return it to the heat. Add the ladle of butter, white wine, and oyster liquor to the skillet. Also, add the meat of 2-3 crabs, oysters, grated nutmeg, minced thyme, and anchovies. Stir everything together and let it simmer for about 5-7 minutes, or until the flavors have melded together.

6. Once the sauce is ready, add the plaice collops back into the skillet. Allow them to simmer in the sauce for an additional 2-3 minutes, or until they are fully cooked and tender.

7. To serve, place sippets (toasted bread) on a serving platter. Arrange the plaice collops on top of the sippets. Spoon the sauce over the collops. Garnish with sliced hard-boiled egg yolks and orange slices.
