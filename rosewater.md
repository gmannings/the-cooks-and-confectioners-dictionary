# Rosewater

## Description
Rosewater is a fragrant liquid made from rose petals. It can be used in cooking, baking, and as a natural beauty product.

## Ingredients:
- Fresh rose petals (preferably Damask roses)

## Instructions:
1. Gather the rose petals when they are dry and before they fully open.
2. Pick off the leaves from the petals, ensuring they are clean and free from any seeds.
3. Spread the petals on a cloth and allow them to dry until most of the moisture has evaporated.
4. Place the dried rose petals into a pewter still.
5. Gently heat the still by making a fire underneath it. Gradually increase the heat.
6. Attach a receiver to the nose of the still using paper or cloth to seal it tightly, preventing any scent from escaping.
7. Allow the rosewater to distill slowly, collecting it in the receiver.
8. Once the distillation is complete, cork the bottles tightly, filling them up to within an inch of the cork.
9. The rose petals will be left at the bottom of the still in a cake-like form. Dry these petals in the sun to use as a perfume.

## Cooking time
Approximately 2-3 hours, depending on the heat source and the amount of rose petals used.
