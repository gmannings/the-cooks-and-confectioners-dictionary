# Boiled Chub with Melted Butter

## Description
This recipe is for a traditional boiled chub fish served with melted butter. The chub is first boiled in a mixture of beer-vinegar and water, seasoned with salt and fennel. After boiling, the fish is drained and the flesh is picked from the bones. It is then served hot with melted butter.

## Ingredients:
- 1 chub fish (approximately 500g)
- 500ml beer
- 250ml vinegar
- 250ml water
- Salt, to taste
- Fennel, a small bunch
- 100g butter

## Instructions:
1. In a large kettle, combine the beer, vinegar, and water in a ratio that will just cover the fish.
2. Add a generous amount of salt and the fennel to the kettle.
3. Scale, gut, and clean the chub fish.
4. Once the liquid in the kettle is boiling, carefully place the chub fish into the kettle.
5. Boil the fish until it is cooked through. The cooking time will depend on the size of the fish, but it is usually around 10-15 minutes per 500g.
6. While the fish is boiling, prepare a board to drain the cooked fish. Once the fish is cooked, carefully transfer it to the board and let it drain for about an hour.
7. After the fish has drained, carefully pick the flesh from the bones, ensuring there are no bones left in the flesh.
8. Place the picked fish flesh into a pewter dish.
9. In a separate small saucepan, melt the butter over low heat until it is completely melted.
10. Pour the melted butter over the picked fish flesh in the pewter dish.
11. Place the pewter dish over a chafing dish of coals or a low heat source to keep it warm.
12. Serve the boiled chub with melted butter while it is still hot.

## Cooking time
Approximately 30-45 minutes, depending on the size of the fish.
