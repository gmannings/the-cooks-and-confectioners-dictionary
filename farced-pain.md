# Farced Pain

## Description
Farced Pain is a dish made with a French loaf filled with a ragout of veal sweetbreads, artichoke bottoms, truffles, and gammon. The loaf is toasted and soaked in broth before being filled with the ragout. It is served with mutton gravy and a thickening liquor of lemon juice.

## Options and commentary
- You can use chicken or turkey sweetbreads instead of veal sweetbreads.
- If you can't find artichoke bottoms, you can substitute with mushrooms.
- Truffles can be quite expensive and hard to find, so you can omit them if necessary.
- Gammon is a type of ham, so you can use ham as a substitute.
- Mutton gravy can be replaced with beef or veal gravy.
- Lemon juice thickening liquor can be made by mixing lemon juice with a little cornstarch or flour.

## Ingredients:
- 1 French loaf

3. Cut out the crumb from the French loaf, leaving a hollow space in the center.
4. Toast the French loaf in the preheated oven until golden brown.
5. Soak the toasted French loaf in good broth for about 15 minutes to soften it.
