# Pickled Walnuts

## Description
Pickled walnuts are a tangy and flavorful condiment that can be enjoyed on their own or added to various dishes. This recipe involves soaking the walnuts in hot water, boiling them, and then pickling them in a mixture of white wine vinegar and spices.

## Ingredients:
- Walnuts (before their shells are fully hardened)
- Scalding hot water
- Fresh scalding water
- White wine vinegar
- Shallots
- Garlic cloves
- Mustard seeds, crushed
- Cracked pepper
- Ginger
- Cloves
- Mace
- Nutmeg, cut into 6-8 pieces

## Instructions:
1. Place the walnuts in a large bowl or container.
2. Pour scalding hot water over the walnuts, making sure they are fully submerged. Let them soak in the hot water for a week.
3. After a week, drain the walnuts and discard the hot water.
4. Pour fresh scalding water over the walnuts and boil them for 15 minutes. This helps to soften them further.
5. Drain the boiled walnuts and pat them dry with a clean kitchen towel.
6. In a separate container, combine white wine vinegar with the shallots, garlic cloves, crushed mustard seeds, cracked pepper, ginger, cloves, mace, and nutmeg pieces. The quantities of these ingredients can vary based on the amount of walnuts you are pickling.
7. Place the boiled and dried walnuts into the container with the vinegar mixture, ensuring that they are fully submerged.
8. Cover the container with a lid or plastic wrap and let the walnuts steep in the cold pickle for nine to ten days.
9. After the steeping period, remove the walnuts from the pickle and set them aside.
10. Transfer the pickle liquid to a saucepan and bring it to a boil. Allow it to boil for a few minutes.
11. Let the pickle liquid cool completely.
12. Once cooled, place the walnuts back into the pickle liquid.
13. Tightly seal the container with white paper and leather to ensure proper preservation.
