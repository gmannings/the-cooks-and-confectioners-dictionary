# Stuffed Pullets with Oysters in Bladders

## Description
This recipe involves stuffing pullets (young chickens) with a mixture of oysters, hard-boiled eggs, marrow, and chestnuts. The pullets are then cooked in bladders, which helps to retain their moisture and flavor. The dish is served with a fricassee of oysters, garnished with small pastry shells and shredded chicken. 

## Options and commentary
- Instead of using bladders, you can use oven-safe cooking bags or aluminum foil to enclose the pullets while cooking.
- If you prefer a more modern approach, you can roast the stuffed pullets in the oven instead of boiling them.
- The fricassee sauce can be thickened with flour or cornstarch if desired.

## Ingredients:
- 4 pullets (young chickens)
- 1 quart of oysters
- 4 hard-boiled eggs, chopped
- 100g marrow, diced
- 100g chestnuts, peeled and chopped
- Bladders or oven-safe cooking bags
- For the sauce:
  - Fricassee of oysters
  - Small pastry shells (petty-patties)
  - 1 hahed pullet (cooked and shredded)
  - Grated bread
  - 2 egg yolks

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 180째C (350째F) if roasting the pullets, or prepare a large pot of boiling water if using bladders.
2. Raise the skins of the breasts of the pullets without tearing them.
3. In a bowl, combine the oysters, chopped hard-boiled eggs, diced marrow, and chopped chestnuts. Season the mixture with salt and pepper.
4. Stuff the mixture between the skin and flesh of the pullets, and also place some of it into their bellies. If desired, remove the flesh from the pullets' breasts, make a forcemeat with it, and stuff the breasts again.
5. Clean the bladders or prepare oven-safe cooking bags by ensuring they are clean and intact.
6. Place one pullet into each bladder or cooking bag, and tie them securely.
7. If roasting, place the stuffed pullets on a roasting rack in a roasting pan and cook in the preheated oven for approximately 1 hour and 30 minutes, or until the internal temperature reaches 75째C (165째F).
8. If boiling, carefully place the tied bladders or cooking bags into the pot of boiling water. Boil the pullets for approximately 2 and a half hours.
9. While the pullets are cooking, prepare the sauce. Make a fricassee of oysters and garnish it with small pastry shells and shredded cooked pullet. Bind the ingredients with grated bread and raw egg yolks.
10. Once the pullets are cooked, remove them from the bladders or cooking bags and place them on a serving platter.
11. Pour the fricassee sauce over the pullets and serve them as the first course.
