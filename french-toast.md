# French Toast

## Description
French Toast is a classic breakfast dish made by soaking bread in a mixture of eggs and milk, then frying it until golden brown. It is a delicious and easy way to use up stale bread and can be served with a variety of toppings and accompaniments.

## Options and commentary
- You can use any type of bread for French Toast, but a thick and crusty bread like French bread or brioche works best.
- Instead of wine, you can use milk or a combination of milk and cream for soaking the bread.
- You can add flavorings such as vanilla extract, cinnamon, or nutmeg to the egg mixture for extra flavor.
- Serve French Toast with maple syrup, powdered sugar, fresh fruits, or whipped cream.

## Ingredients:
- Thick slices of French bread (or any other bread of your choice)
- 2 eggs

3. Dip each slice of bread into the egg mixture, allowing it to soak for a few seconds on each side.
4. Place the soaked bread slices onto the preheated skillet or griddle.
5. Cook the French Toast for 2-3 minutes on each side, or until golden brown and cooked through.
6. Remove the French Toast from the skillet and transfer to a serving plate.
