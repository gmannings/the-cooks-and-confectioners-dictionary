# Dzel's Sturgeon in Haricot with Turnips

## Description
This recipe is for a classic 18th century dish called "Dzel's Sturgeon in Haricot with Turnips." It involves boiling sturgeon in a flavorful broth, frying it until brown, and then simmering it in a cullis (a thick sauce) with turnips and gammon. The dish can be served with lemon juice and garnished with marinade or other accompaniments.

## Options and commentary
- Sturgeon: Sturgeon can be difficult to find, so a good alternative would be any firm white fish such as cod or halibut.
- Gammon: Gammon is a type of cured ham. If you can't find gammon, you can use regular ham or bacon as a substitute.
- Marinade: The original recipe suggests serving the dish with marinade, which is a mixture of pickled vegetables. You can use any pickled vegetables of your choice or skip this garnish altogether.

## Ingredients:
- 1 kg sturgeon (or any firm white fish)
- Salt and pepper to taste
- 4 cloves
- 1 onion, sliced
- 1 sprig of thyme
- 500 ml fish or vegetable broth
- 2 tbsp lard or cooking oil
- 2 turnips, peeled and diced
- 100 g gammon (or ham/bacon), sliced or chopped
- Lemon juice, for serving
- Marinade or pickled vegetables, for garnish (optional)

## Instructions:
1. In a large pot, bring water to a boil and season it with salt, pepper, cloves, sliced onion, and thyme.
2. Add the sturgeon (or white fish) to the pot and simmer for about 10-15 minutes, or until the fish is cooked through. Remove the fish from the pot and set aside.
3. In a separate frying pan, heat the lard or cooking oil over medium heat.
4. Fry the sturgeon in the hot lard until it turns brown and crispy on both sides. Remove the fish from the pan and set aside.
5. In the same frying pan, remove any excess fat and add the diced turnips and sliced gammon (or ham/bacon). Cook until the turnips are tender and the gammon is cooked through.
6. In a blender or food processor, blend the cooked turnips, gammon, and a small amount of the fish or vegetable broth until smooth. This will be the cullis.
7. Return the cullis to the frying pan and add the remaining fish or vegetable broth. Stir well to combine.
8. Place the fried sturgeon back into the pan with the cullis and turnip mixture. Simmer gently for a few minutes to allow the flavors to meld together.
9. Serve the sturgeon in haricot with turnips hot, drizzled with lemon juice and garnished with marinade or pickled vegetables if desired.
