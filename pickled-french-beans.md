# Pickled French Beans

## Description
This recipe is for pickling French beans, also known as green beans. The beans are blanched briefly in a vinegar pickle with salt and horseradish, then stored in the pickle to develop flavor over time. Pickled French beans make a tangy and crunchy addition to salads, sandwiches, or antipasto platters.

## Ingredients:
- 500g French beans
- 500ml white vinegar
- 2 tablespoons salt
- 2 tablespoons sliced horseradish

## Instructions:
1. Wash the French beans and trim off the ends.
2. In a large pot, bring the vinegar, salt, and sliced horseradish to a boil.
3. Add the French beans to the boiling pickle and cook for 3-4 minutes.
4. Remove the beans from the pickle using a slotted spoon and transfer them to a clean, sterilized jar.
5. Pour the hot pickle over the beans, ensuring they are fully submerged.
6. Seal the jar tightly and let it cool to room temperature.
7. Store the jar in a cool, dark place for 2-3 days.
8. After 2-3 days, open the jar and pour out the pickle into a pot.
9. Bring the pickle to a boil again and pour it back over the beans in the jar.
10. Seal the jar tightly and let it cool to room temperature.
11. Repeat steps 8-10 every 2-3 days for the next 2-3 weeks.
12. After 2-3 weeks, the pickled French beans are ready to be enjoyed.
