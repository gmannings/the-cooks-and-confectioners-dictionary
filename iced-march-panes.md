# Iced March-panes

## Description
Iced March-panes are a type of sweet pastry that was popular in the 18th century. They are made by baking and coloring a pastry, then icing the underside with a sweet mixture. The icing is made by combining sweet water, juices, or marmalades with powdered sugar until it reaches a thick consistency. The icing is then spread onto the baked pastry and allowed to set.

## Ingredients:
- Orange-flower water or other sweet water
- Juices or marmalades (such as lemon juice or orange marmalade)
- Powdered sugar
- March-panes (previously baked and colored)

## Instructions:
1. In a bowl, combine the orange-flower water or sweet water with the juices or marmalades. Start with a small amount and gradually add more until you achieve the desired flavor.
2. Gradually add powdered sugar to the mixture, stirring well after each addition. Continue adding powdered sugar until the mixture reaches the consistency of a thick paste or pap.
3. Take the previously baked and colored March-panes and carefully cut them off from the paper they were baked on.
4. Using a knife, spread the prepared icing onto the underside of the March-panes. Ensure that the icing is evenly spread and covers the entire surface.
5. Place the iced March-panes onto a sheet of paper and cover them with the oven lid. Place some fire on top of the lid to provide heat and help the icing set.
6. Allow the icing to coagulate and set. This may take some time, so be patient.
7. Once the icing is set, carefully remove the iced March-panes from the paper and transfer them to boxes for storage and future use.

## Cooking time
The cooking time for this recipe will depend on the baking and coloring of the March-panes, which is not specified in the original recipe. The icing will need some time to set, so allow for additional time for that process as well.
