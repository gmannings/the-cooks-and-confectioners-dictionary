# Preserved Mushrooms

## Description
This recipe provides instructions for preserving mushrooms so that they can be enjoyed throughout the year. The mushrooms are first blanched, then seasoned with spices and herbs, and finally preserved in a pickling liquid. When ready to use, the preserved mushrooms can be refreshed by soaking them in water.

## Ingredients:
- Mushrooms
- Nutmeg
- Cloves
- Mace
- Cinnamon stick
- Basil
- Young onions
- Bay leaves
- Salt

- Clarified butter

## Instructions:
1. Clean the mushrooms by removing any dirt or debris. Trim the stems if necessary.
2. Bring a pot of water to a boil. Add the mushrooms and let them boil for a few minutes.
3. Drain the mushrooms and transfer them to a sieve to remove excess water. Allow them to cool completely.
4. In an earthen pan, layer the mushrooms with nutmeg, cloves, mace, cinnamon stick, basil, young onions, and bay leaves.
5. In a separate container, prepare a pickle by mixing salt and water. Let it stand for two hours.
6. Pour the pickle over the mushrooms, ensuring that they are fully covered. 
7. Pour clarified butter on top of the mushrooms to create a seal.
