## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F).
2. Prepare a well-seasoned Godivoe (gravy) by thickening it with the yolks of eggs and crumb-bread soaked in good gravy or a little cream of milk.
3. Line the bottom of a baking pan with slices of bacon.
4. Place the Godivoe on top of the bacon slices, creating a well in the center with raised sides.
5. Dip your fingers in beaten egg and make a hole the size of your plate in the center of the Godivoe, raising the sides about three inches high.
6. Cut the fowl into pieces and beat them well.
7. Fry the fowl in lard with chives, parsley, and a little flour until browned.
8. Moisten the fried fowl with gravy, season well, and add veal sweetbreads, mushrooms, and truffles (if using), all cut into slices.
9. Cook the fowl mixture until there is only a little sauce left.
10. Arrange the fowl pieces in the prepared Grenadine dish, ensuring they are in order.
11. Sprinkle bread crumbs over the top of the Grenadine to give it a good color in the oven.
12. Place the Grenadine in the preheated oven and bake until the crust is golden brown.
13. Once cooked, remove the Grenadine from the oven and drain away any excess fat.
14. Cut off the bacon bards around the edges of the Grenadine.
15. Carefully transfer the Grenadine to a serving plate.
16. Optionally, pour a cullis of mushrooms over the Grenadine before serving.
17. Serve the Grenadine hot as a side dish or a main course.
