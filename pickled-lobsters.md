# Pickled Lobsters

## Description
This recipe is for pickled lobsters, a dish that was popular in the 18th century. The lobsters are boiled and then pickled in a mixture of port wine, water, herbs, cucumbers, capers, and mushrooms. The pickled lobsters are then stored in a pot and sealed.

## Ingredients:
- 2 lobsters
- Water
- Salt
- 500 ml port wine
- 500 ml water
- 2 sprigs of rosemary
- 2 sprigs of thyme
- 2 sprigs of savory
- 2 small cucumbers
- 2 tablespoons capers
- 10 whole mushrooms

## Instructions:
1. Fill a large pot with water and add salt. Bring the water to a boil.
2. Add the lobsters to the boiling water and cook until they can be easily removed from their shells. This will take about 10-15 minutes.
3. Once the lobsters are cooked, remove them from the pot and set them aside to cool.
4. In a separate pot, combine the port wine and water in equal quantities. Add the rosemary, thyme, savory, cucumbers, capers, and mushrooms to the pot.
5. Bring the mixture to a boil and let it simmer for a few minutes.
6. Remove the pot from the heat and let the pickle mixture cool.
7. Once the lobsters have cooled, remove the tails from the shells and set them aside.
8. Place the pickled lobsters and the pickle mixture in a long pot or jar.
9. Seal the pot or jar tightly.
10. Let the pickled lobsters sit for at least a day before serving to allow the flavors to develop.
