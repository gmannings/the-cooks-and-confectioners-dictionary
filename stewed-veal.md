# Stewed Veal

## Description
Stewed veal is a classic dish that features tender pieces of veal cooked in a flavorful broth. The veal is seasoned with salt, pepper, onion, lemon peel, mace, and shallots, and then stewed in water or port wine with a little butter. The dish is finished off with beaten egg yolks, which add richness and a velvety texture to the sauce.

## Ingredients:
- 500g veal, cut into small pieces
- Salt, to taste
- Whole pepper, to taste
- 1 onion, finely chopped
- Peel of 1 lemon
- 1/2 teaspoon ground mace
- 2-3 shallots, finely chopped
- 250ml water or port wine
- 2 tablespoons butter
- 2 egg yolks, beaten

## Instructions:
1. Season the veal pieces with salt and whole pepper.
2. In a large pot, melt the butter over medium heat.
3. Add the chopped onion, lemon peel, mace, and shallots to the pot. Cook until the onion is translucent and fragrant.
4. Add the veal pieces to the pot and cook until they are browned on all sides.
5. Pour in the water or port wine, making sure it covers the veal.
6. Bring the liquid to a simmer, then reduce the heat to low and cover the pot.
7. Allow the veal to stew for about 1.5 to 2 hours, or until it is tender and cooked through. Stir occasionally to prevent sticking.
8. In a small bowl, beat the egg yolks until smooth.
9. Slowly pour the beaten egg yolks into the pot, stirring constantly.
10. Cook for an additional 2-3 minutes, or until the sauce thickens slightly.
11. Remove the pot from the heat and transfer the stewed veal to a serving dish.
12. Serve the stewed veal hot, with the sauce spooned over the top.
