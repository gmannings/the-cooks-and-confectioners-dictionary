# Roasted Stuffed Pig with Sage and Barberry Sauce

## Description
This recipe is for a roasted pig that is stuffed with a flavorful mixture of bread, sage, and herbs. It is then basted with butter and roasted until crispy. The pig is served with a tangy sauce made from sage, nutmeg, currants, bread, vinegar, barberries, and sugar.

## Options and commentary
- Instead of a whole pig, you can use a pork loin or shoulder roast for a smaller version of this dish.
- If you don't have barberries, you can substitute with cranberries or currants.
- The sauce can be made with or without the addition of sweet herbs like penny-royal and savory.

## Ingredients:
- 1 whole pig (or pork loin/shoulder roast)
- 1 cup bread crumbs
- 2 tablespoons chopped sage
- 1 teaspoon grated nutmeg
- 1/4 cup currants
- 1/4 cup grated bread
- 1/4 cup vinegar
- 1/4 cup barberries (or cranberries/currants)
- 1 tablespoon sugar
- 4 tablespoons butter
- Salt and pepper to taste
- Sweet herbs (optional, such as penny-royal and savory)

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F).
2. If using a whole pig, scald, draw, and wash it clean. If using a pork loin or shoulder roast, skip this step.
3. In a bowl, mix together the bread crumbs, chopped sage, grated nutmeg, currants, and grated bread.
4. If using a whole pig, stuff the mixture into the belly of the pig. If using a pork loin or shoulder roast, make a slit in the meat and stuff the mixture inside.
5. If using sweet herbs, roll them up into small balls with butter and place them inside the belly of the pig (or the slit in the meat).
6. Stitch up the belly of the pig or secure the slit in the meat with kitchen twine.
7. Place the pig (or pork loin/shoulder roast) on a spit and secure it over a fire or in a roasting pan.
8. Baste the pig with butter every 20 minutes while it roasts.
9. Roast the pig for approximately 2-3 hours, or until the skin is crispy and golden brown. If using a pork loin or shoulder roast, adjust the cooking time accordingly.
10. While the pig is roasting, prepare the sauce. In a saucepan, combine the vinegar, barberries, sugar, and a little water. Cook over low heat until the barberries are soft and the sugar has dissolved.
11. Add the chopped sage, grated nutmeg, currants, and grated bread to the saucepan. Cook for a few minutes, stirring constantly.
12. Add the brains (if using) and a good piece of butter to the saucepan. Stir until the butter has melted and the sauce has thickened slightly.
13. Divide the roasted pig into sections (body, head, shoulders) and cut off the ears. Place the ears on the shoulders.
14. Serve the roasted pig with the sauce drizzled over the top.

## Cooking time
- Whole pig: 2-3 hours
- Pork loin/shoulder roast: Adjust cooking time accordingly
