# Capon Pudding

## Description
Capon Pudding is a savory dish made with minced capon meat, hogs feet, onions, herbs, and spices. The mixture is then combined with beaten eggs and milk, stuffed into casings, and cooked on a grill.

## Options and commentary
- Instead of capon, you can use chicken or turkey meat as a substitute.
- If hogs feet are not available, you can use pork belly or bacon as a replacement.
- Feel free to adjust the spices and herbs according to your taste preferences.
- The pudding can be served as a main dish or as a side dish with vegetables.

## Ingredients:
- 1 capon (or chicken/turkey)
- 2 hogs feet (or pork belly/bacon)
- 2 roasted onions
- Fresh herbs (such as parsley, thyme, and rosemary)
- Salt and pepper to taste
- 2-3 eggs (whites and yolks separated)
- 1 liter of milk

## Instructions:
1. Preheat your grill or broiler.

2. Roast the capon in the oven until fully cooked. Remove the meat from the breast and finely mince it.

3. Thinly slice the hogs feet (or pork belly/bacon) and place them in a saucepan with the roasted onions. Cook them together until the hogs feet are tender.

4. Transfer the cooked hogs feet and onions to a mortar. Add the minced capon meat, fresh herbs, salt, and pepper. Pound the mixture until well combined and the ingredients are finely chopped.

5. In a separate bowl, beat the egg whites until frothy. Gradually add the beaten egg yolks and milk, whisking continuously.

6. Pour the milk and egg mixture into a saucepan and heat it over medium heat until it thickens and becomes creamy.

7. Combine the creamy milk mixture with the minced capon and hogs feet mixture. Mix well.

8. Prepare casings for the pudding by blanching them in a mixture of water and milk with slices of onions. This will help remove any strong flavors and soften the casings.

9. Stuff the casings with the capon pudding mixture, making sure to tie off the ends securely.

10. Grease a sheet of parchment paper with lard and place it on a grill or broiler pan.

11. Grill or broil the capon puddings over a gentle fire until they are cooked through and browned on the outside. This should take about 10-15 minutes per side.

12. Serve the capon puddings hot, either as a main dish or as a side dish with vegetables.

## Cooking time
Approximately 1 hour (including roasting the capon)
