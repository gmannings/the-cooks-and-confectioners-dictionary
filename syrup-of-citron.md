# Syrup of Citron

## Description
Syrup of Citron is a sweet and tangy syrup made from thinly sliced citrons and sugar. It can be used as a flavoring in beverages, desserts, or as a topping for pancakes or waffles.

## Ingredients:
- 2 citrons
- 500g fine sugar

## Instructions:
1. Wash the citrons thoroughly and pat them dry.
2. Peel the citrons using a vegetable peeler or a sharp knife. Make sure to remove only the outer yellow part of the peel, avoiding the white pith.
3. Slice the peeled citrons thinly.
4. In a glass or ceramic container, layer the sliced citrons and fine sugar. Start with a layer of sugar, then a layer of citron slices, and continue until all the citrons and sugar are used.
5. Cover the container and let it sit overnight to allow the sugar to draw out the juice from the citrons.
6. The next day, carefully pour off the liquid into a glass container, leaving behind the citron slices and any sediment.
7. Skim off any foam or impurities from the surface of the liquid.
8. Place the glass container with the liquid over a gentle heat source, such as a double boiler or a saucepan filled with simmering water.
9. Heat the liquid slowly, stirring occasionally, until the sugar is completely dissolved and the liquid becomes clear.
10. Remove from heat and let the syrup cool completely.
11. Once cooled, transfer the syrup to a clean, airtight glass bottle or jar for storage.
