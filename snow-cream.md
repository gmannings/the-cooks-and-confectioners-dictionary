# Snow Cream

## Description
Snow Cream is a creamy and refreshing dessert made with whipped cream and flavored with rosewater. The whipped cream is then served on top of a thickened cream base, which is infused with spices like cinnamon, cloves, and ginger.

## Ingredients:
- 1 quart (946 ml) heavy cream
- 6 egg whites
- Sugar, to taste
- Rosewater, to taste
- 1 stick of cinnamon
- 4 whole cloves
- 1 small piece of ginger, bruised

## Instructions:
1. In a large bowl, combine the heavy cream, egg whites, sugar, and rosewater. Mix well until the ingredients are fully incorporated.
2. Using a bundle of reeds tied together or a stick cleft at one end and rolled between your hands, beat the cream mixture vigorously while standing upright in the bowl. Continue beating until the mixture thickens and forms soft peaks.
3. Once the cream has thickened, use a spoon to transfer the whipped cream into a colander. Allow the liquid part to drain out, leaving behind the fluffy snow-like cream.
4. In a saucepan, combine the remaining cream with the stick of cinnamon, whole cloves, and bruised ginger. Bring the mixture to a boil over medium heat, stirring occasionally.
5. Reduce the heat to low and simmer the cream mixture until it thickens to a custard-like consistency. This should take about 15-20 minutes.
6. Once the cream has thickened, strain it to remove the spices and any lumps.
7. Allow the cream to cool completely.
8. Transfer the cooled cream into a serving dish.
9. Spoon the whipped cream snow on top of the thickened cream base.
10. Serve chilled and enjoy!
