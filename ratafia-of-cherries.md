# Ratafia of Cherries

## Description
Ratafia of Cherries is a traditional liqueur made from cherries, strawberries, spices, sugar, and brandy. It has a rich and fruity flavor with hints of cinnamon and cloves. This recipe requires a few weeks of steeping time to allow the flavors to meld together.

## Options and commentary
- You can adjust the amount of sugar according to your taste preference.
- If fresh cherries and strawberries are not available, you can use frozen ones instead.
- Feel free to experiment with different spices such as cardamom or star anise to add your own twist to the recipe.
- The addition of raspberry and strawberry juices or steeping the fruits separately in brandy can enhance the aroma of the ratafia.
- If you want a deeper color, you can add mulberry juice to the mixture.

## Ingredients:
- 10 kg ripe cherries
- 2 kg strawberries
- 3 kg sugar
- 1 handful of whole white pepper
- 4 cinnamon sticks
- 24 cloves
- Nutmeg, to taste
- Kernels of the cherries
- 11.4 liters good brandy
- Optional: raspberries and strawberries for steeping separately
- Optional: mulberry juice for coloring

## Instructions:
1. Wash and pit the cherries. Place them in a large container or brandy cask.
2. Bruise the cherries using a muddler or the back of a spoon to release their juices.
3. Add the strawberries to the container and bruise them as well.
4. Add the sugar, whole white pepper, cinnamon sticks, cloves, nutmeg, and cherry kernels to the container.
5. Pour the brandy over the fruit and spices, ensuring that they are fully submerged.
6. Leave the container open for 10-12 days to allow the flavors to infuse.
7. After the initial steeping period, close the container tightly and let it stand for an additional 2 months.
8. If desired, steep raspberries and strawberries separately in brandy with sugar and cinnamon for added aroma.
9. After the 2-month steeping period, strain the ratafia through a fine-mesh strainer or cheesecloth to remove any solids.
10. Optional: If you want a deeper color, mix mulberry juice with brandy and strain it through a fine-mesh strainer or cheesecloth.
11. Transfer the strained ratafia to bottles or jars for storage.
12. The ratafia is now ready to be enjoyed. Serve it chilled or use it as an ingredient in cocktails.

## Cooking time
