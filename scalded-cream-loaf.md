# Scalded Cream Loaf

## Description
This recipe is a modernized version of an 18th-century recipe for a scalded cream loaf. It is a sweet and creamy bread pudding-like dish, flavored with spices, raisins, and dates. The loaf is baked until set but not overcooked to avoid curdling. It is then finished with a sprinkle of sugar and served as a delightful dessert.

## Options and commentary
- You can use any type of bread suitable for making bread pudding, such as brioche or challah.
- Feel free to adjust the amount of sugar and spices according to your taste preferences.
- You can add a splash of vanilla extract or a pinch of nutmeg for extra flavor.
- Serve the scalded cream loaf warm or at room temperature, with a dollop of whipped cream or a scoop of vanilla ice cream if desired.

## Ingredients:
- 4 cups cubed bread (manchet or any suitable bread)
- 2 cups cream
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 1/4 cup sugar
- 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
- 1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg
- 2 eggs, beaten
- 1/2 cup chopped dates
- 1/2 cup raisins
- Sugar, for sprinkling

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease a baking dish or loaf pan.
2. In a saucepan, heat the cream over medium heat until it starts to steam. Do not let it boil.
3. Place the cubed bread in a large bowl. Pour the hot cream over the bread and let it sit for 10 minutes to allow the bread to absorb the cream.
4. In a separate bowl, mix together the salt, sugar, cinnamon, and nutmeg.
5. Add the beaten eggs, chopped dates, and raisins to the bread mixture. Stir well to combine.
6. Sprinkle the spice and sugar mixture over the bread mixture and stir again to evenly distribute the spices.
7. Transfer the mixture to the greased baking dish or loaf pan. Smooth the top with a spatula.
8. Bake in the preheated oven for about 40-45 minutes, or until the loaf is set and golden brown on top. Be careful not to overbake, as it may cause curdling.
9. Remove from the oven and let it cool for a few minutes. Sprinkle sugar over the top of the loaf.
10. Serve the scalded cream loaf warm or at room temperature. Optionally, serve with whipped cream or vanilla ice cream.
