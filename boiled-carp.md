# Boiled Carp

## Description
Boiled Carp is a classic dish that was popular in the 18th century. The carp is boiled and then served with a flavorful sauce made with butter, anchovies, capers, vinegar, lemon, and spices. It can also be served with a sauce made of butter, herbs, and fish broth. The dish is finished with a squeeze of orange juice for a tangy and refreshing flavor.

## Ingredients:
- 1 whole carp (approximately 1-1.5 kg)
- 50g butter, melted
- Salt
- For the sauce:
  - 50g butter
  - 2 anchovy fillets, finely chopped
  - 1 tablespoon capers
  - 1 tablespoon vinegar
  - 1 lemon, sliced
  - 1/2 teaspoon pepper
  - Salt, to taste
  - 1/4 teaspoon nutmeg
  - For the alternative sauce:
    - 50g butter
    - 1/2 teaspoon pepper
    - Salt, to taste
    - 2 tablespoons parsley, finely chopped
    - 2 tablespoons chives, finely chopped
    - 250ml fish broth or fish stock
    - Juice of 1 orange

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 180Â°C.
2. Clean the carp thoroughly, removing scales and innards. Rinse it under cold water and pat dry with paper towels.
3. Rub the melted butter all over the carp, making sure to coat it evenly. Sprinkle salt over the buttered carp.
4. Place the carp on a greased grill rack and place it in the preheated oven. Cook for approximately 20-25 minutes per 500g of fish, or until the flesh is opaque and flakes easily with a fork.
5. While the carp is cooking, prepare the sauce. For the first sauce option, melt the butter in a saucepan over medium heat. Add the anchovies, capers, vinegar, lemon slices, pepper, salt, and nutmeg. Cook for a few minutes until the flavors meld together. Keep warm.
6. For the alternative sauce, melt the butter in a separate saucepan over medium heat. Add the pepper, salt, parsley, and chives. Cook for a minute or two until the herbs are fragrant. Add the fish broth or fish stock and simmer for 5 minutes. Stir in the orange juice and keep warm.
7. Once the carp is cooked, carefully transfer it to a serving platter. Pour the desired sauce over the carp, ensuring it is evenly coated.
8. Serve the boiled carp hot with additional sauce on the side.

## Cooking time
