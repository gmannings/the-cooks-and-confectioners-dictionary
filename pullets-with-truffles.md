# Pullets with Truffles

## Description
This recipe is a modernized version of an 18th-century dish called "Pullets with Truffles." It features roasted pullets (young chickens) stuffed with a mixture of breadcrumbs, herbs, and shredded truffles. The dish is served with a truffle ragout, made with sliced raw truffles cooked in veal gravy and thickened with a velvety sauce made from veal and ham stock. The result is a flavorful and elegant main course.

## Options and commentary
- If truffles are not available or too expensive, you can substitute them with truffle oil or truffle salt to add a similar flavor.
- You can use chicken breasts or whole chickens instead of pullets if desired.
- Serve the pullets with a side of roasted vegetables or a fresh salad for a complete meal.

## Ingredients:
- 2 pullets (or chicken breasts/whole chickens)
- 2 truffles, shredded
- 1 cup breadcrumbs
- 2 tablespoons chopped fresh herbs (such as parsley, thyme, and rosemary)
- Salt and pepper to taste
- 2 slices of bacon (for barding)
- 1 cup veal gravy
- 1 cup veal and ham stock
- Additional salt and pepper for seasoning the ragout

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 180째C (350째F).
2. In a bowl, combine the shredded truffles, breadcrumbs, chopped herbs, salt, and pepper to make the stuffing mixture.
3. Carefully loosen the skin of the pullets by gently sliding your fingers between the skin and the meat, being careful not to tear the skin.
4. Stuff the pullets with the truffle stuffing mixture, distributing it evenly under the skin.
5. Lay the bacon slices over the top of each pullet, covering the breast area.
6. Place the pullets on a roasting rack in a roasting pan and roast in the preheated oven for approximately 1 hour or until the internal temperature reaches 75째C (165째F).
7. While the pullets are roasting, prepare the truffle ragout. Peel and wash the raw truffles, then slice them thinly.
8. In a stew-pan, combine the sliced truffles, veal gravy, and a pinch of salt and pepper. Cook over low heat, stirring occasionally, until the truffles are tender.
9. In a separate saucepan, prepare a velvety sauce by combining the veal and ham stock with a few tablespoons of the truffle ragout. Cook over medium heat until the sauce thickens.
10. Once the pullets are cooked, remove them from the oven and let them rest for a few minutes.
11. Remove the bacon slices from the pullets and discard.
12. To serve, place the pullets on a serving platter and pour the truffle ragout over them.
13. Serve the Pullets with Truffles as a first course or main course.
