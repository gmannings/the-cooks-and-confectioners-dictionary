# Fozc'd Eat

## Description
Fozc'd Eat is a traditional dish made from a mixture of veal, suet, and bacon. The ingredients are boiled together, minced, and then pounded into a paste. The mixture is seasoned with salt and pepper, and raw eggs and soaked French rolls are added to bind the paste together. The resulting paste can be used in various dishes.

## Options and commentary
- You can use ground veal instead of boiling and mincing veal.
- Instead of suet, you can use butter or vegetable shortening.
- Use lean bacon instead of fat bacon.
- You can use breadcrumbs instead of soaked French rolls.
- The paste can be used to make meatballs, meatloaf, or stuffing for other dishes.

## Ingredients:
- 1 kg veal (ground or boiled and minced)
- 250 g suet (or butter/vegetable shortening)
- 250 g lean bacon
- Salt and pepper to taste
- 10 raw eggs
- 2 French rolls (soaked in broth or milk) or 100 g breadcrumbs

## Instructions:
1. If using ground veal, skip to step 3. If using boiled and minced veal, place the veal, suet, and bacon in a large pot. Add enough water to cover the ingredients.
2. Bring the water to a boil and cook the ingredients for 30 minutes.
3. Drain the boiled ingredients and transfer them to a bowl of cold water. This will prevent the bacon and other fats from turning into oil when minced.
4. Drain the ingredients again and mince each ingredient separately, as finely as possible.
5. Place the minced veal, suet, and bacon in a marble mortar (or use a food processor) and pound them together until well combined.
6. Season the mixture with salt and pepper to taste.
7. Add the raw eggs and soaked French rolls (or breadcrumbs) to the mixture. Mix well until everything is evenly incorporated.
8. The resulting paste is now ready to be used in various dishes or can be stored for later use.
