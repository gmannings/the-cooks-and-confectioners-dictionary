# Candied Gilliflowers

## Description
Candied Gilliflowers are a sweet treat made from gilliflowers (clove-scented flowers) that have been coated in a sugary syrup and dried. They make a delightful addition to cakes, pastries, or can be enjoyed on their own as a sweet treat.

## Ingredients:
- Gilliflowers (clove-scented flowers)
- Refined sugar
- Rose water

## Instructions:
1. Weigh the gilliflowers to determine the amount of sugar needed. The weight of the flowers should be equal to the weight of refined sugar.
2. Sift the refined sugar to remove any lumps.
3. In a saucepan, combine the sifted sugar with a small amount of rose water. Start with a tablespoon and adjust as needed to create a thick syrup.
4. Place the saucepan over a gentle charcoal fire or low heat on the stovetop.
5. Add the gilliflowers to the syrup and stir gently to coat them evenly.
6. Continue stirring the flowers in the syrup until the sugar reaches a candied height. This means that the sugar has thickened and formed a crystallized coating on the flowers.
7. Once the flowers are candied, remove them from the syrup and place them on a wire rack or parchment paper to dry.
8. Allow the candied gilliflowers to dry completely in a dry place before using or storing them.

## Cooking time
Approximately 30 minutes to 1 hour, depending on the size and quantity of gilliflowers.
