# Compofts of Pears

## Description
Compofts of Pears is a sweet and syrupy dish made from pears cooked in sugar syrup. The pears are first scalded to soften them, then peeled and cut into halves or quarters. They are then boiled in a mixture of clarified sugar and water until a thick syrup forms.

## Ingredients:
- Pears
- Clarified sugar
- Water

## Instructions:
1. Prick the pears on the top with a bodkin to the core.
2. Scald the pears in water until they become soft.
3. Remove the pears from the water and let them cool.
4. Peel the pears and throw them into fresh water.
5. If the pears are large, cut them into halves or quarters.
6. Put the pears into a pot or saucepan.
7. Add clarified sugar and a little water to the pot.
8. Boil the pears in the sugar syrup, skimming off any scum that rises to the surface.
9. Continue boiling until no more scum rises and the syrup thickens.
10. If there is too much syrup left, boil it until it is reduced to the desired quantity.
11. Pour the syrup over the cooked pears.

## Cooking time
Approximately 30-45 minutes, depending on the size and ripeness of the pears.
