## Ingredients:
- 500g all-purpose flour
- 225g unsalted butter
- 1 liter cream
- 18 eggs
- 50ml sack (fortified wine)
- 50ml rose water
- 500ml ale
- 225g raisins, stoned and shredded
- 1kg currants
- 225g sugar
- 1 tablespoon ground mace
- 1/2 tablespoon ground cinnamon
- 2 whole nutmegs, grated
- A few cloves, ground
- 1/4 tablespoon ground ginger
- A pinch of salt
- Optional: 225g candied orange and lemon peel, chopped
- Optional: Additional dried fruits such as chopped dates or figs

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F).
2. In a large bowl, sift the flour and spread it out on a baking sheet. Place the baking sheet in the oven for about 10 minutes to dry out the flour. Remove from the oven and let it cool.
3. In a saucepan, melt the butter over low heat. Add the cream and heat gently until warm. Remove from heat and let it cool slightly.
4. In a separate bowl, beat the eggs, keeping out 6 of the egg whites. Add the sack, rose water, and ale to the beaten eggs. Mix well.
5. Strain the butter and cream mixture into the egg mixture, stirring continuously.
6. In a large mixing bowl, combine the dried fruits (raisins, currants, and any optional dried fruits), sugar, ground mace, ground cinnamon, grated nutmegs, ground cloves, ground ginger, and salt. Mix well.
7. Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, stirring until well combined.
8. If using, fold in the candied orange and lemon peel.
9. Grease a cake tin or line it with parchment paper. Pour the cake batter into the tin, smoothing the top with a spatula.
10. Place the tin in the preheated oven and bake for approximately 2 hours, or until a skewer inserted into the center comes out clean.
11. Remove the cake from the oven and let it cool in the tin for 10 minutes. Then transfer it to a wire rack to cool completely.
12. Once the cake is completely cooled, you can choose to ice it with a simple glaze or frosting if desired.
