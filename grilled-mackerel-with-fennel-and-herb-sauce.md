# Grilled Mackerel with Fennel and Herb Sauce

## Description
This recipe is for grilled mackerel served with a flavorful fennel and herb sauce. The mackerel is first seasoned with oil, salt, pepper, and fennel, then grilled to perfection. The sauce is made with clarified butter, sweet herbs, salt, nutmeg, gooseberries, fennel, vinegar, and capers. This dish can also be served with clarified butter, salt, pepper, vinegar, and fried parsley. Alternatively, you can cook the mackerel in clarified butter and then simmer it in fish broth or broth of herbs to serve it in a soup. Garnish with a ragout of mushrooms and capers.

## Options and commentary
- You can choose to either fillet or gut the mackerel before cooking.
- The fennel can be used to wrap the mackerel before grilling, or it can be added to the sauce for extra flavor.
- The sauce can be adjusted to taste by adding more or less of the ingredients.
- If you prefer a simpler preparation, you can skip the sauce and just season the mackerel with oil, salt, pepper, and fennel before grilling.

## Ingredients:
- 2 mackerel, gutted and washed
- Oil, for seasoning
- Salt, to taste

8. Pour the prepared sauce over the grilled mackerel, ensuring it is evenly coated.
9. Garnish with additional fennel and fried parsley, if desired.
10. If serving in a soup, heat some clarified butter in a separate pan and fry the mackerel until golden brown.
11. Transfer the fried mackerel to a pot of fish broth or broth of herbs and simmer for about 10 minutes.
12. Serve the mackerel in the soup, garnished with a ragout of mushrooms and capers.
