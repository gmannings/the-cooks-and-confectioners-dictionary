# Roasted Snipes with Lemon Sauce

## Description
This recipe is a modern adaptation of an 18th-century dish called "Dzels Snipes in Ragoo." It features roasted snipes, a type of small game bird, seasoned with salt, pepper, and lemon juice. The snipes are cooked until tender and served hot, garnished with slices of lemon. This dish is perfect for a special occasion or a fancy dinner.

## Ingredients:
- 4 snipes
- Salt and pepper, to taste
- 2 tablespoons melted bacon fat or vegetable oil
- 2 tablespoons lemon juice
- 1 tablespoon chopped chives
- 4 slices of lemon, for garnish

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 200°C (400°F).
2. Rinse the snipes under cold water and pat them dry with paper towels.
3. Using a sharp knife, carefully slit each snipe in half lengthwise, without removing anything from their bellies.
4. Season the snipes generously with salt and pepper on both sides.
5. Heat the melted bacon fat or vegetable oil in a large oven-safe skillet over medium-high heat.
6. Add the snipes to the skillet, skin side down, and cook for 2-3 minutes until the skin is browned and crispy.
7. Flip the snipes over and transfer the skillet to the preheated oven.
8. Roast the snipes for about 10-12 minutes, or until they are cooked through and tender.
9. While the snipes are roasting, prepare the lemon sauce. In a small bowl, combine the lemon juice and chopped chives.
10. Once the snipes are done, remove them from the oven and transfer them to a serving platter.
11. Drizzle the lemon sauce over the snipes and squeeze some additional lemon juice on top.
12. Garnish the snipes with slices of lemon.
13. Serve the roasted snipes hot as a main course, accompanied by your favorite side dishes.
