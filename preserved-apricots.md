# Preserved Apricots

## Description
Preserved apricots are a sweet and tangy treat that can be enjoyed on their own or used in various desserts and baked goods.

## Ingredients:
- Ripe apricots
- Sugar
- White wine or water

## Instructions:
1. Wash the apricots and remove the skin and pit. Cut them into halves or quarters, depending on your preference.
2. In a preserving pan or a large saucepan, layer the apricot pieces with sugar. Use about 1 part sugar to 2 parts apricots.
3. Let the apricots and sugar sit overnight to allow the flavors to meld together.
4. In the morning, add a little white wine or water to the pan. This will help to melt the sugar and create a syrup.
5. Place the pan on a very gentle fire or low heat. Gradually increase the heat to melt the sugar, stirring occasionally to prevent sticking.
6. Once the apricots are slightly scalded, remove the pan from the heat and let it cool.
7. Return the pan to the heat and continue to boil the apricots gently until they become tender and well-colored. This may take about 20-30 minutes.
8. Once the apricots are cooked, remove them from the heat and let them cool completely.
9. Transfer the preserved apricots into clean pots or glasses for storage.
