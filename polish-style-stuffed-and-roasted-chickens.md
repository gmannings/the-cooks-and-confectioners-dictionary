# Polish-style Stuffed and Roasted Chickens

## Description
This recipe is a modernized version of an 18th-century recipe for Polish-style roasted chickens. The chickens are stuffed with a flavorful mixture of bacon, anchovies, herbs, and spices, then roasted to perfection. They are basted with bacon drippings to add extra flavor and served with a warm sauce called Ramolade.

## Ingredients:
- 2 whole chickens
- 200g bacon, divided
- 100g anchovies
- 1 tablespoon mixed dried herbs (such as thyme, rosemary, and sage)
- 1 teaspoon ground black pepper
- 3 eggs, yolks only
- Salt, to taste
- For the Ramolade sauce (see Letter R):
  - Ingredients for Ramolade sauce (refer to the recipe for Ramolade)

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 180째C (350째F).
2. In a food processor, combine half of the bacon and all of the anchovies. Process until finely chopped.
3. In a bowl, mix together the chopped bacon and anchovies, dried herbs, ground black pepper, and egg yolks. Season with salt to taste. This is the stuffing mixture.
4. Remove the giblets from the chickens and set aside for another use. Rinse the chickens inside and out, then pat dry with paper towels.
5. Carefully loosen the skin of each chicken by gently sliding your fingers between the skin and the meat, being careful not to tear the skin.
6. Stuff the bacon and anchovy mixture under the skin of each chicken, distributing it evenly.
7. Truss the chickens with kitchen twine to secure the stuffing and keep the shape intact.
8. Place the chickens on a roasting rack in a roasting pan, breast side up.
9. Roast the chickens in the preheated oven for about 1 hour and 30 minutes, or until the internal temperature reaches 75째C (165째F) when measured with a meat thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the thigh.
10. While the chickens are roasting, prepare the Ramolade sauce according to the recipe in Letter R.
11. When the chickens are about halfway cooked, heat a fire-shovel or a cast-iron skillet until it is almost red hot.
12. Place the remaining bacon slices on the hot shovel or skillet and let them cook until they release their fat and become crispy.
13. Use the hot bacon fat to baste the chickens every 15 minutes, being careful not to blacken the skin.
14. Once the chickens are fully cooked, remove them from the oven and let them rest for 10 minutes before carving.
15. Serve the roasted chickens with the warm Ramolade sauce.

## Cooking time
