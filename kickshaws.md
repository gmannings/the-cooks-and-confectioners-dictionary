# Kickshaws

## Description
Kickshaws are small, savory pastries filled with various ingredients. In this modernized recipe, we will make puff pastry and fill it with a variety of options such as gooseberries, raspberries, lambstones, or veal kidneys. The pastries can be baked or fried and are finished with a sprinkle of sugar.

## Options and commentary
- You can choose to fill the kickshaws with any of the following options: gooseberries, raspberries, lambstones, or veal kidneys. Alternatively, you can experiment with other fillings of your choice.
- The choice of baking or frying the kickshaws depends on your preference. Baking will result in a lighter, flakier pastry, while frying will give a crispier texture.
- The kickshaws can be served as a snack, appetizer, or even as part of a main course.

## Ingredients:
- Puff pastry dough (store-bought or homemade)
- Preserved pippins (apple slices preserved in syrup)
- Filling options:
  - Gooseberries
  - Raspberries
  - Lambstones (small pieces of lamb meat)
  - Veal kidneys
- Sugar, for sprinkling

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 200°C (400°F) if you choose to bake the kickshaws. If frying, skip this step.
2. Roll out the puff pastry dough on a lightly floured surface until it is thin.
3. If you have any molds, use them to shape the kickshaws. Otherwise, you can cut the dough into small squares or circles.
4. Place a preserved pippin slice on each piece of dough.
5. Choose your desired filling option and place it on top of the pippin slice. If using meat fillings like lambstones or veal kidneys, make sure to season them with salt and pepper before adding to the kickshaws.
6. Fold the dough over the filling to enclose it completely. Press the edges firmly to seal.
7. If baking, place the kickshaws on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. If frying, heat oil in a deep pan or fryer.
8. If baking, bake the kickshaws in the preheated oven for about 15-20 minutes, or until they are golden brown and puffed up. If frying, carefully place the kickshaws in the hot oil and fry until they are crispy and golden brown on both sides.
9. Once cooked, remove the kickshaws from the oven or oil and let them cool slightly.
10. Sprinkle the kickshaws with sugar while they are still warm.
11. Serve the kickshaws as a snack, appetizer, or part of a main course.

## Cooking time
- Baking: 15-20 minutes
- Frying: Varies depending on the size and thickness of the kickshaws, but approximately 5-8 minutes per batch.
