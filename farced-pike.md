# Farced Pike

## Description
Farced Pike is a dish made by stuffing a pike fish with a mixture of minced fish, mushrooms, herbs, and spices. The stuffed fish is then cooked in a flavorful broth and served with a ragout made from crayfish tails, mushrooms, and asparagus (if in season).

## Options and commentary
- Instead of pike, you can use any other firm white fish such as cod or halibut.
- If you don't have access to crayfish, you can use shrimp or lobster as a substitute.
- If asparagus is not in season, you can omit it or use other vegetables like peas or green beans.
- Adjust the seasoning according to your taste preferences.

## Ingredients:
- 1 pike (or any firm white fish)
- 1 piece of carp or eel
- 100g mushrooms, finely chopped
- 2 tablespoons chives, chopped
- 2 tablespoons parsley, chopped
- Salt and pepper to taste
- 1/4 teaspoon nutmeg
- 1 clove, pounded
- 1/2 teaspoon coriander seeds, pounded
- 50g butter
- 1/2 cup breadcrumbs
- 1/4 cup cream
- 2 raw eggs, yolks only
- 2 tablespoons flour
- 1/2 cup white wine
- 1/2 cup fish broth
- 2 cloves
- 1 sprig of sweet herbs (such as thyme or rosemary)
- 1 small onion, chopped
- 100g crayfish tails
- 100g mushrooms, sliced
- 100g asparagus tops (blanched if using)

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F).
2. Clean and fillet the pike, removing the bones but leaving the head and tail intact. Set aside.
3. In a bowl, combine the minced fish (carp or eel), chopped mushrooms, chives, parsley, salt, pepper, nutmeg, pounded clove, and pounded coriander seeds.
4. In a separate saucepan, melt the butter and add the breadcrumbs. Cook over low heat until the breadcrumbs are lightly toasted.
5. Add the cream and egg yolks to the saucepan with the breadcrumbs. Stir well to combine.
6. Add the breadcrumb mixture to the bowl with the minced fish mixture. Mix everything together until well combined.
7. Stuff the pike with the farce mixture, then sew it up using kitchen twine to hold the stuffing in place.
8. Place the stuffed pike in a large stewpan, making sure it fits comfortably.
9. In a separate saucepan, melt some butter and add the flour. Cook over medium heat until the flour is lightly browned.
10. Add the white wine and fish broth to the saucepan with the butter and flour. Stir well to combine.
11. Pour the wine and broth mixture over the stuffed pike in the stewpan.
12. Season the stewpan with salt, pepper, cloves, sweet herbs, parsley, and onions.
13. Place the stewpan over low heat and simmer gently for about 30 minutes, or until the pike is cooked through. Be careful not to let it break apart.
14. While the pike is simmering, prepare the ragout. In a separate pan, melt some butter and add the sliced mushrooms, crayfish tails, and asparagus tops. Cook over medium heat until the mushrooms are tender.
15. Add a little fish broth to the pan with the mushrooms, crayfish, and asparagus. Cook for a few more minutes until the mixture is slightly thickened.
16. Once the pike is cooked, carefully remove it from the stewpan and place it on a serving dish to drain.
17. Transfer the pike to another serving dish and pour the ragout over it.
18. Serve the farced pike hot.
