# Marinated Chicken Quarters

## Description
This recipe involves marinating chicken quarters in a flavorful mixture of vinegar, verjuice, lemon juice, salt, pepper, cloves, chibbols (spring onions), and a bay leaf. The marinated chicken is then coated in a batter made of flour, white wine, and egg yolks, and fried until golden. It is served with slices of lemon and crispy parsley.

## Ingredients:
- 4 chicken quarters
- 1/4 cup vinegar
- 1/4 cup verjuice (or substitute with apple cider vinegar)
- Juice of 1 lemon
- Salt, to taste
- Pepper, to taste
- 4 cloves
- 4 spring onions (chibbols), chopped
- 1 bay leaf
- 1 cup flour
- 1/4 cup white wine
- 2 egg yolks
- Butter or lard, for frying
- Lemon slices, for serving
- Crispy parsley, for garnish

## Instructions:
1. In a bowl, combine the vinegar, verjuice, lemon juice, salt, pepper, cloves, chopped spring onions, and bay leaf to make the marinade.
2. Place the chicken quarters in a shallow dish and pour the marinade over them. Make sure the chicken is fully coated. Cover the dish and refrigerate for at least three hours to marinate.
3. In a separate bowl, whisk together the flour, white wine, and egg yolks to make the batter.
4. Remove the chicken quarters from the marinade and pat them dry with paper towels.
5. Dip each chicken quarter into the batter, making sure it is evenly coated.
6. Heat butter or lard in a frying pan over medium heat.
7. Fry the chicken quarters in the melted butter or lard until they are golden brown and cooked through, about 10-12 minutes per side.
8. Remove the fried chicken quarters from the pan and place them on a paper towel-lined plate to drain any excess oil.
9. Serve the marinated chicken quarters with slices of lemon and garnish with crispy parsley.
