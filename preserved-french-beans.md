# Preserved French Beans

## Description
Preserved French Beans are a method of preserving fresh beans for later use. The beans are blanched, dried, and stored in a dry place. When ready to use, they are soaked in lukewarm water to rehydrate and regain their vibrant green color. They can then be blanched and prepared as desired.

## Ingredients:
- Fresh French beans

## Instructions:
1. Pick the French beans, removing any stems or blemished beans.
2. Blanch the beans by bringing a pot of water to a boil and adding the beans. Cook for 2-3 minutes until they are bright green and slightly tender.
3. Drain the beans and transfer them to a clean kitchen towel or paper towels to remove excess moisture.
4. Lay the blanched beans in a single layer on a clean, dry surface, such as a baking sheet or a wire rack.
5. Place the beans in a sunny spot and allow them to dry completely. This may take several days, depending on the weather conditions.
6. Once the beans are thoroughly dry, transfer them to an airtight container or a resealable plastic bag. Store in a cool, dry place until ready to use.

To use the preserved beans:
1. Take the desired amount of preserved beans and place them in a bowl.
2. Cover the beans with lukewarm water and let them soak for two days. This will help rehydrate the beans and restore their green color.
3. After soaking, drain the beans and rinse them under cold water.
4. Blanch the beans again by bringing a pot of water to a boil and adding the soaked beans. Cook for 2-3 minutes until they are tender.
5. Drain the beans and they are now ready to be used in your favorite recipes.
