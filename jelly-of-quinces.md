# Jelly of Quinces

## Description
This recipe is for making a delicious jelly using quinces. The quince juice is combined with sugar and boiled to a candy-like consistency. White wine and cherry or plum tree gum are added to create a perfect jelly.

## Ingredients:
- Quinces
- Sugar
- White wine
- Cherry-tree or plum-tree gum

## Instructions:
1. Wash the quinces thoroughly and cut them into quarters. Remove the cores and seeds.
2. Place the quince quarters in a large pot and cover them with water. Bring to a boil and simmer until the quinces are soft and tender.
3. Remove the quinces from the pot and let them cool slightly. Once cooled, press out the juice from the quinces using a fine-mesh strainer or cheesecloth.
4. Measure the quince juice and pour it into a clean pot. For every quart of juice, add a pound of clarified sugar.
5. Place the pot with the quince juice and sugar over medium heat. Stir until the sugar has dissolved completely.
6. Increase the heat to high and bring the mixture to a boil. Continue boiling until the mixture reaches a candy-like consistency. This can be tested by dropping a small amount of the mixture into a bowl of cold water. It should form a firm ball.
7. In a separate container, dissolve an ounce of cherry-tree or plum-tree gum in a pint of white wine.
8. Once the quince mixture has reached the candy-like consistency, reduce the heat to low and slowly pour in the white wine mixture. Stir well to combine.
9. Continue simmering the mixture on low heat for another 10-15 minutes, stirring occasionally.
10. Remove the pot from the heat and let the jelly cool slightly.
11. Pour the jelly into sterilized jars and seal tightly.
12. Allow the jelly to cool completely before storing it in a cool, dark place.

## Cooking time
Approximately 1-2 hours, depending on the size and ripeness of the quinces.
