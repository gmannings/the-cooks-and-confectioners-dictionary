# Roasted Pike with Anchovy Sauce

## Description
This recipe is for a roasted pike, stuffed with lardons of eel and seasoned with salt, pepper, nutmeg, sweet herbs, and cives. The pike is then roasted on a spit and basted with a mixture of white wine, butter, lemon juice, and vinegar. Once cooked, the pike is served with a sauce made from the drippings of the fish, melted anchovies, oysters, white pepper, and capers. The dish is garnished with fried mushrooms, carp roe, and slices of lemon.

## Ingredients:
- 1 whole pike, scaled and gutted
- Lardons of eel
- Salt
- Pepper
- Nutmeg

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to the desired temperature for roasting (e.g., 180Â°C).
2. Scale the pike and pat it dry.
3. Make small incisions in the pike and insert lardons of eel into the cuts.
4. Season the pike with salt, pepper, nutmeg, sweet herbs, and cives, both inside and out.

7. Baste the pike with the basting mixture every 10-15 minutes throughout the cooking process.
8. Roast the pike until it is cooked through and the skin is crispy and golden brown. The cooking time will depend on the size of the pike, but it is typically around 20-30 minutes per kilogram of fish.
9. Once the pike is cooked, remove it from the spit and transfer it to a serving dish.

12. Add oysters, white pepper, and capers to the sauce and let them simmer for a few minutes.
13. Taste the sauce and adjust the seasoning if needed.
14. Pour the sauce over the roasted pike and garnish the dish with fried mushrooms, carp roe, and slices of lemon.
