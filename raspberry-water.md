# Raspberry Water

## Description
Raspberry water is a refreshing and fragrant drink made from fresh raspberries, water, and sugar. It is a perfect summer beverage that can be enjoyed on its own or used as a base for cocktails or mocktails.

## Ingredients:
- 500g fresh raspberries
- 1 liter water
- 200g sugar
- Optional: musk or amber for perfume

## Instructions:
1. Pick the raspberries and gently bruise them to release their juices.
2. In a large pot, combine the bruised raspberries, water, and sugar.
3. Bring the mixture to a boil over medium heat, stirring occasionally to dissolve the sugar.
4. Once boiling, reduce the heat to low and let the mixture simmer for 10 minutes.
5. Remove the pot from the heat and let it cool to room temperature.
6. Once cooled, strain the mixture through a fine-mesh sieve or cheesecloth to remove any solids. Press down on the solids to extract as much liquid as possible.
7. If desired, pass the strained liquid through a straining bag to further clarify it.
8. If you want to add a perfume to the raspberry water, you can do so by adding a few drops of musk or amber to the strained liquid. Adjust the amount according to your preference.
9. Transfer the raspberry water to a clean bottle or pitcher and refrigerate until chilled.
10. Serve the raspberry water over ice and enjoy!
