# Baked Gammon of Bacon

## Description
This recipe is for a baked gammon of bacon. The gammon is first soaked in water overnight, then stuffed with a mixture of sweet herbs, hard-boiled egg yolks, pepper, and nutmeg. It is then boiled until tender, cooled, and seasoned with pepper and nutmeg. Finally, it is placed in a pie or pastry with cloves and slices of raw bacon, baked until cooked through.

## Ingredients:
- 1 gammon of bacon
- Water, for soaking
- Sweet herbs (such as parsley, thyme, sage, savory, sweet marjoram, penny-royal, rosemary, strawberry leaves, violet leaves, fennel), finely chopped
- 4 hard-boiled egg yolks, chopped
- Pepper, to taste
- Nutmeg, to taste
- Whole cloves
- Slices of raw bacon
- Butter
- Pie crust or pastry

## Instructions:
1. Place the gammon of bacon in a large container and cover it with water. Let it soak overnight.
2. After soaking, remove the gammon from the water and scrape off any impurities or dirt. 
3. In a bowl, mix together the finely chopped sweet herbs, chopped hard-boiled egg yolks, pepper, and nutmeg.
4. Stuff the gammon with the herb mixture, ensuring it is evenly distributed.
5. Place the stuffed gammon in a large pot and cover it with water. Bring the water to a boil and then reduce the heat to a simmer. Cook the gammon until it is tender. The cooking time will depend on the size of the gammon, but it is typically around 20 minutes per pound (450 grams).
6. Once the gammon is cooked, remove it from the pot and let it cool.
7. Once cooled, peel off the skin from the gammon and trim off any excess fat if desired.
8. Season the gammon with additional pepper and nutmeg to taste.
9. Preheat the oven to the temperature specified by your pie crust or pastry recipe.
10. Line a pie dish or prepare a pastry crust according to your preferred recipe.
11. Place the seasoned gammon in the pie dish or on the prepared pastry.
12. Arrange whole cloves and slices of raw bacon over the gammon.
13. Dot the top of the gammon with small pieces of butter.
14. Cover the gammon with the pie crust or pastry, sealing the edges.
15. Bake the gammon in the preheated oven until the crust is golden brown and the gammon is heated through. The baking time will depend on the size of the gammon and the type of crust used, but it is typically around 30-45 minutes.
16. Once baked, remove the gammon from the oven and let it cool slightly before serving.

## Cooking time
Approximately 20 minutes per pound (450 grams) for boiling the gammon, plus 30-45 minutes for baking.
