# Preserved Grapes

## Description
Preserved grapes are a sweet and tangy treat that can be enjoyed on their own or used as a topping for desserts. This recipe involves stoning the grapes, scalding them, and then preserving them in a syrup made with refined sugar. The grapes are then drained and boiled in the syrup until they are almost ready to boil. Finally, they are stored in pots with a jelly made from apple water and sugar.

## Ingredients:
- 1 kg white grapes
- 1 kg double-refined loaf sugar
- 1 liter water
- Pippin-water (strong apple water)
- Additional double-refined sugar for making jelly

## Instructions:
1. Wash the grapes and remove the stems.
2. Stone the grapes by cutting them in half and removing the seeds.
3. Place the stoned grapes in a large pot and cover them with water.
4. Heat the pot over medium heat until the water is scalding hot.
5. Remove the pot from the heat and transfer the grapes to a bowl of cold water.
6. In a separate pot, combine the double-refined loaf sugar and water. Heat the mixture over low heat until the sugar is completely dissolved, stirring occasionally.
7. Once the sugar syrup is cold, arrange the stoned grapes in a preserving pan.
8. Pour the syrup over the grapes, making sure they are fully covered.
9. Cover the preserving pan with a piece of parchment paper and let it sit for 24 hours.
10. After 24 hours, place the preserving pan over a gentle fire and heat the syrup until it is scalding hot.
11. Remove the preserving pan from the heat and let it sit, covered with parchment paper, for another 24 hours.
12. Drain the grapes from the syrup and set them aside.
13. Return the syrup to the heat and boil it until it reaches a thick, syrupy consistency.
14. Place the grapes in a clean pan and pour the syrup over them. Heat the pan over low heat until the grapes are almost ready to boil.
15. Cover the pan and let it sit for another 24 hours.
16. Transfer the preserved grapes to pots or jars.
17. In a separate pot, combine the pippin-water and double-refined sugar to make a jelly.
18. Pour the jelly over the preserved grapes in the pots.
19. Seal the pots and store them in a cool, dark place.
