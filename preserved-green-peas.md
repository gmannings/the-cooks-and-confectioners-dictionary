# Preserved Green Peas

## Description
Preserved green peas are a method of preserving fresh peas for later use. The peas are blanched, dried, and stored in bottles with melted fat. When ready to use, they are boiled with butter and sugar for a delicious side dish.

## Ingredients:
- Fresh green peas
- Water
- Mutton fat (or vegetable oil as a modern alternative)
- Fresh butter
- Sugar

## Instructions:
1. Shell the peas and rinse them in water.
2. Bring a pot of water to a boil and add the peas.
3. Blanch the peas for 2-3 minutes, just until they are slightly tender.
4. Spread a clean cloth on a dresser or countertop.
5. Drain the blanched peas in a colander and spread them out on the cloth.
6. Allow the peas to dry thoroughly on the cloth.
7. Prepare dry bottles by cleaning and sterilizing them.
8. Fill the bottles with the dried peas, filling them up to the necks.
9. Melt the mutton fat (or vegetable oil) and pour it over the peas in the bottles, ensuring they are completely covered.
10. Cork the bottles tightly to prevent air from entering.
11. Store the bottles in a cool place, such as a pantry or cellar.
12. When ready to use the preserved peas, bring a pot of water to a boil.
13. Add a good piece of fresh butter and a spoonful of sugar to the boiling water.
14. Add the preserved peas to the boiling water and cook until they are tender.
15. Drain the cooked peas and serve them as a side dish.

## Cooking time
Approximately 20-30 minutes, depending on the desired tenderness of the peas.
