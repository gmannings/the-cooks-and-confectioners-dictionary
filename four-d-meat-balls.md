# Four'd Meat Balls

## Description
Four'd Meat Balls are a traditional 18th-century dish made with a combination of veal and beef suet. The meat is seasoned with salt, pepper, nutmeg, rosemary, and sage, then mixed with eggs to form a paste. The paste is shaped into round or sausage-like balls and boiled in strong broth.

## Options and commentary
- You can use ground veal and beef suet instead of slicing and hacking the meat.
- If you prefer a leaner option, you can use ground lean beef instead of beef suet.
- Adjust the seasoning according to your taste preferences.
- Serve the meatballs with the broth as a soup or with a sauce of your choice.

## Ingredients:
