# Partridges the Spanish Way

## Description
This recipe is for partridges cooked in a Spanish style. The partridges are first parboiled, then roasted and served with a flavorful sauce made from the pounded partridge, truffles, veal gravy, essence of ham, red wine, rocambolles, onion, and Seville oranges.

## Options and commentary
- Instead of partridges, you can use chicken or any other game bird.
- If truffles are not available, you can substitute with mushrooms.
- If essence of ham is not available, you can use a small amount of smoked ham or bacon.
- Rocambolles are a type of garlic, if you can't find them, you can use regular garlic cloves.
- Sallet oil is a type of salad dressing, you can use olive oil as a substitute.
- Seville oranges can be substituted with regular oranges or a combination of orange and lemon juice.

## Ingredients:
- 2 partridges (or chicken or game bird of your choice)
- 4 truffles (or mushrooms)
- 1/2 cup veal gravy
- 1/2 cup essence of ham (or smoked ham or bacon)
- 1/4 cup red wine
- 2 rocambolles (or garlic cloves)
- 2-3 slices of onion
- 2-3 Seville oranges (or regular oranges or a combination of orange and lemon juice)
- 2-3 tablespoons salad oil (or olive oil)

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F).
2. Parboil the partridges by placing them in a pot of boiling water for about 5 minutes. Remove from the water and let them cool.
3. Bard the partridges by wrapping them with slices of bacon or fatback to keep them moist during roasting.
4. Roast the partridges in the preheated oven for about 30-40 minutes, or until cooked through and golden brown.
5. While the partridges are roasting, prepare the sauce. In a mortar, pound one of the partridges and the livers of all the partridges together with the truffles until well combined.
6. In a saucepan, combine the veal gravy and essence of ham. Add the pounded partridge mixture and place over a gentle fire. Let it simmer, but not boil.
7. After simmering for a while, strain the mixture through a sieve to remove any solids.
8. In another saucepan, combine the red wine, rocambolles, and onion slices. Boil until the wine is reduced by half, then strain through a sieve to remove the solids.
9. Cut up the roasted partridges into serving pieces and place them in a stewpan or saucepan.
10. Add the strained wine mixture, along with the veal gravy mixture and 2-3 tablespoons of salad oil.
11. Place the stewpan or saucepan over hot embers or low heat and let it simmer, but not boil, for about 10-15 minutes to allow the flavors to meld together.
12. Once the partridges are heated through and the sauce has thickened slightly, remove from heat.
13. Arrange the partridges on a serving platter in a visually appealing manner.
14. Squeeze the juice of 2-3 Seville oranges (or regular oranges or a combination of orange and lemon juice) over the partridges.
15. Pour the sauce over the partridges.
16. Serve the partridges hot as a first course.
