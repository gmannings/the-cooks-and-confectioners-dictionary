## Ingredients:

- 50g lard or beef suet, minced
- 2 tablespoons fresh herbs (such as parsley, thyme, and rosemary), finely chopped
- 50g grated Parmesan cheese

- 4 cabbage lettuce leaves
- 2 tablespoons butter
- Sippets (toasted bread) for serving

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 180Â°C.
2. Pluck, scald, and gut the pigeons. Remove the skins, leaving them whole with the legs and wings attached.
3. In a bowl, combine the minced meat (pork or beef) with the minced lard or beef suet.
4. Add the finely chopped herbs, grated Parmesan cheese, breadcrumbs, and egg yolks to the meat mixture. Season with salt, pepper, ginger, cloves, and mace. Mix well to combine.
5. Stuff the pigeon skins with the meat mixture, then stitch them closed at the back.

8. Cover the dish or stew-pan and transfer it to the preheated oven. Cook for about 1 hour or until the pigeons are tender and cooked through.
9. To serve, place the sippets on a serving platter. Arrange the stewed pigeons on top of the sippets and spoon some of the broth, herbs, and fruits over the pigeons.
10. Serve the boiled cabbage lettuce on the side.
