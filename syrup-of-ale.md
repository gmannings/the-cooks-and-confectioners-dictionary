# Syrup of Ale

## Description
Syrup of Ale is a medicinal syrup made from reducing ale-wort. It was traditionally used to treat conditions such as heat of urine, stoppage in the reins, and whites in women.

## Ingredients:
- 8 liters of ale-wort (the first running)
- Water (as needed)

## Instructions:
1. In a large iron pot, pour in the ale-wort.
2. Place the pot on the stove and bring the ale-wort to a boil.
3. Boil the ale-wort uncovered, skimming off any impurities that rise to the surface.
4. Continue boiling the ale-wort until it has reduced to 1 liter (or 1 quart), stirring occasionally.
5. Remove the pot from the heat and allow the syrup to cool slightly.
6. Transfer the syrup to a clean, airtight container.
7. Store the syrup in a cool, dark place.

## Cooking time
Approximately 2-3 hours, depending on the heat of the stove and the desired consistency of the syrup.

## Options and commentary
- If you don't have access to ale-wort, you can substitute it with a good quality ale or beer. However, the flavor and medicinal properties may vary.
- It is important to continuously skim off any impurities that rise to the surface during the boiling process to ensure a clean and clear syrup.
- The syrup can be consumed as is or mixed with other ingredients to create different medicinal concoctions.
