# Cullards

## Description
Cullards are a type of custard dessert that was popular in the 18th century. They are made with cream, eggs, sugar, and flavored with either orange-flower or rose water. There are two variations of cullards - one baked in pastry cups and the other baked in a larger dish.

## Options and commentary
- You can choose to flavor the cullards with either orange-flower water or rose water, depending on your preference.
- You can use a pre-made pie crust or make your own for the pastry cups.
- The baking time will vary depending on the size of the cups or dish used.

## Ingredients:
- For the pastry cups:
  - Pre-made pie crust or homemade pastry dough
- For the custard filling:
  - 3 pints (1.4 liters) of cream
  - A few whole mace blades
  - 8 eggs
  - Orange-flower water or rose water
  - 1.5 pounds (680 grams) of sugar

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 350°F (180°C).
2. If using pre-made pie crust, roll it out and cut circles to fit your pastry cups. If making homemade pastry dough, prepare the dough according to your recipe.
3. Line the pastry cups with the pie crust, making sure to prick the bottoms with a fork to prevent them from puffing up during baking. Place the cups on a baking sheet.
4. In a saucepan, heat the cream and whole mace blades over medium heat until it comes to a gentle simmer. Remove from heat and let it cool.
5. In a mixing bowl, beat the eggs together, leaving out 4 of the whites.
6. Gradually add the cooled cream to the beaten eggs, stirring constantly.
7. Add a few tablespoons of orange-flower water or rose water to the mixture, adjusting to taste.
8. Stir in the sugar until well combined.
9. Pour the custard mixture into the prepared pastry cups, filling them almost to the top.
10. Place the baking sheet with the filled cups in the preheated oven.
11. Bake for approximately 25-30 minutes, or until the custard is set and the tops are lightly golden.
12. Remove from the oven and let the cullards cool before serving.
