# Spanish Cream

## Description
Spanish Cream is a traditional dessert made from thick, creamy milk that has been allowed to rise overnight. It has a smooth and velvety texture, and is typically served chilled. The layers of cream and sugar create a sweet and indulgent treat.

## Ingredients:
- 1 liter whole milk
- Sugar, to taste

## Instructions:
1. Heat the milk in a saucepan until it is hot, but not boiling.
2. Carry the hot milk to a cool place, such as a refrigerator or a cold room.
3. Pour the milk into a large bowl or pail.
4. Place pans on the ground and stand on a stool.
5. Slowly pour the milk into the pans, allowing it to rise in bubbles as it falls.
6. Cover the pans and let them stand overnight.
7. In the morning, the milk will have thickened and formed a tough cream on top.
8. Use a skimmer or a slotted spoon to skim off the cream from the top of the pans.
9. Place the cream in a dish, layering it one on top of the other.
10. Sprinkle sugar between each layer of cream.
11. Repeat the layering process until all the cream is used.
12. Finish with a layer of sugar on top.
13. Cover the dish and refrigerate for at least 2 hours, or until the cream is chilled and set.
14. Serve the Spanish Cream cold.
