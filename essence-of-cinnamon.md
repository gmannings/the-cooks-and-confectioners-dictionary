# Essence of Cinnamon

## Description
This recipe is for making an essence or oil of cinnamon. It involves steeping cinnamon in warm water, distilling it multiple times, and collecting the oil that separates from the water. The end result is a concentrated essence of cinnamon.

## Ingredients:
- 3 pounds of cinnamon
- 1 gallon of warm water

## Instructions:
1. In a glass vessel, combine the cinnamon and warm water. Ensure that the vessel is well sealed.
2. Allow the cinnamon to steep in the water for two days.
3. After two days, transfer the mixture into an alembic (a type of distillation apparatus).
4. Set up the alembic over a heat source and distill the mixture with a quick fire. Collect the distillate in a receiver.
5. Continue distilling until you have collected three pints of the distillate.
6. Once you have collected the distillate, unlute (open) the alembic and pour the distillate back into it.
7. You will notice that there is an oil that has separated and settled at the bottom of the receiver. Carefully collect this oil and transfer it into a glass vial. Close the vial tightly.
8. Lute (seal) the alembic again and repeat the distillation process, collecting the oil that separates each time. Repeat this step several times until you no longer find any oil in the bottom of the receiver.
9. Once you have finished collecting the oil, remove the heat source and distill the remaining water in the receiver. This can be done in the same manner as rectifying brandy for spirit of wine.
10. Once the water has been distilled, you will be left with an excellent essence of cinnamon.

## Cooking time
The total cooking time for this recipe will depend on the distillation process and the number of times you need to repeat it to collect all the oil.
