# Lobster Pie

## Description
A rich and indulgent pie filled with chunks of conger eel and lobster meat, seasoned with salt, pepper, and nutmeg. The pie is baked to perfection, creating a delicious and flavorful dish.

## Ingredients:
- 1 fat raw conger eel
- 3-4 lobsters
- Salt
- Pepper
- Nutmeg
- Butter
- Pie crust

## Options and commentary
- If conger eel is not available, you can substitute it with another firm white fish such as cod or haddock.
- Lobster can be quite expensive, so you can use a combination of lobster meat and shrimp to make the pie more affordable.
- You can make your own pie crust or use store-bought for convenience.

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F).
2. Prepare the conger eel by cutting it into large square pieces.
3. Slice the meat from the lobster tails and claws in half lengthwise.
4. Remove the meat from the lobster bodies and season both the conger eel and lobster meat with salt, pepper, and nutmeg.
5. Grease the bottom of a pie dish with butter.
6. Place a layer of conger eel slices in the bottom of the pie dish.
7. Add a layer of lobster meat on top of the conger eel.
8. Repeat steps 6 and 7 until the pie dish is filled, alternating between conger eel and lobster meat.
9. Dot the top of the pie with butter.
10. Cover the pie with the pie crust, sealing the edges.
11. Make a few slits on the top crust to allow steam to escape.
12. Place the pie in the preheated oven and bake for approximately 45-60 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown and the filling is cooked through.
13. Remove the pie from the oven and let it cool for a few minutes before serving.
