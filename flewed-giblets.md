# Flewed Giblets

## Description
Flewed Giblets is a dish made from parboiled giblets (such as liver, heart, and gizzard) that are then cooked in a stew with strong broth. The dish is served with French rolls and topped with mutton gravy.

## Ingredients:
- Giblets (such as liver, heart, and gizzard)
- Strong broth
- 2 French rolls
- Mutton gravy

## Instructions:
1. Parboil the giblets by placing them in a pot of boiling water for a few minutes. This will help remove any impurities and partially cook the giblets.
2. Drain the giblets and set them aside.
3. In a saucepan, prepare a fricassee by tossing the giblets in a little oil or butter until they are lightly browned.
4. Transfer the giblets to a stewpan and add enough strong broth to cover them.
5. Cover the stewpan and cook the giblets over a gentle heat until half of the broth has evaporated. This will help concentrate the flavors.
6. While the giblets are stewing, bring a pot of strong broth to a simmer and add the French rolls. Allow the rolls to simmer until they are heated through.
7. Remove the French rolls from the broth and place them in the middle of a serving dish.
8. Arrange the giblets around and on top of the French rolls.
9. Pour mutton gravy over the giblets.
10. Serve the Flewed Giblets hot.
