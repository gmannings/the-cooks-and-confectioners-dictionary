# Raspberry Tart

## Description
A raspberry tart is a sweet dessert made with a buttery pastry crust filled with fresh raspberries and a creamy custard. It is a delicious and refreshing treat perfect for summer.

## Options and commentary
- You can use store-bought puff pastry for convenience, or make your own puff pastry from scratch.
- You can adjust the amount of sugar according to your taste preference.
- Serve the tart with a dollop of whipped cream or a scoop of vanilla ice cream for extra indulgence.

## Ingredients:
- 1 sheet of puff pastry, thawed if frozen
- 2 cups fresh raspberries
- 1/4 cup double-refined sugar (or granulated sugar)
- 1/2 cup heavy cream
- 2-3 egg yolks, beaten
- 1 tablespoon fine sugar (for sprinkling)

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F).
2. Roll out the puff pastry on a lightly floured surface until it is thin and large enough to fit into a tart pan.
3. Place the rolled-out pastry into a greased tart pan, pressing it gently into the bottom and sides.
4. Arrange the fresh raspberries evenly over the pastry.
5. Sprinkle the double-refined sugar over the raspberries.
6. Fold the excess pastry over the raspberries, creating a rustic edge.
7. Bake the tart in the preheated oven for about 25-30 minutes, or until the pastry is golden brown and the raspberries are soft.
8. In a small bowl, whisk together the heavy cream, beaten egg yolks, and fine sugar until well combined.
9. Remove the tart from the oven and carefully pour the cream mixture over the raspberries.
10. Return the tart to the oven and bake for an additional 10-15 minutes, or until the custard is set.
11. Remove the tart from the oven and let it cool completely.
12. Once cooled, remove the lid of the tart and sprinkle some fine sugar around the edges of the dish.
13. Serve the raspberry tart as is or with a dollop of whipped cream or a scoop of vanilla ice cream.
