# Boiling Sugar to its Pearl'd Quality

## Description
This recipe is for boiling sugar to its pearl'd quality, which is a stage of sugar boiling where the sugar forms a string and small pearls on the surface. This technique was commonly used in 18th-century cooking to create various sugar decorations and confections.

## Ingredients:
- Granulated sugar

## Instructions:
1. In a heavy-bottomed saucepan, add the granulated sugar.
2. Place the saucepan over medium heat and let the sugar melt, stirring occasionally with a wooden spoon.
3. Once the sugar has completely melted, continue boiling it for a little longer.
4. To test if the sugar has reached its pearl'd quality, take a drop of the boiling sugar between your finger and thumb.
5. Carefully stretch your finger and thumb apart to see if the sugar forms a string between them. If the string sticks to both your finger and thumb, the sugar has reached its pearl'd quality.
6. Another way to determine the pearl'd quality is by observing small round pearls that rise to the top of the boiling sugar.
7. Once the sugar has reached its pearl'd quality, remove it from the heat and use it as desired for sugar decorations or confections.

## Cooking time
The cooking time will vary depending on the quantity of sugar being boiled and the heat level. It is important to monitor the sugar closely to avoid burning.
