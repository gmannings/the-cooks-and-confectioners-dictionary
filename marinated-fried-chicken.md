# Marinated Fried Chicken

## Description

The marinated chicken is then coated in a batter made with flour, white wine or water, egg yolks, salt, and melted butter. The chicken is fried in lard until it is golden brown and crispy. It is then arranged in the shape of a pyramid and served with fried parsley and slices of lemon.
