# Braised Capon with Crayfish Ragout

## Description
This recipe is for a delicious and flavorful dish featuring a braised capon (a castrated rooster) served with a rich and savory crayfish ragout. The capon is first stewed to tenderize the meat, then topped with a ragout made from mushrooms, truffles, and crayfish tails. The ragout is flavored with melted bacon and a veal gravy, thickened with a crayfish sauce. This dish can be served as a main course for a special occasion or a fancy dinner party.

## Options and commentary
- Instead of a capon, you can use a chicken or a turkey as a substitute.
- If crayfish is not available, you can use shrimp or lobster tails as a replacement.
- You can also add other vegetables to the ragout, such as young onions, cucumbers, celery, or succory, as suggested in the original recipe.
