## Ingredients:
- Pastry dough
- Filling of choice (meat, poultry, or fish)
- Seasonings (salt, pepper, herbs, spices) as desired

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F).
2. Roll out the pastry dough on a lightly floured surface to a thickness of about 1/4 inch.
3. Cut the rolled-out dough into two equal-sized circles, one for the bottom crust and one for the top crust of the pie.
4. Line a pie dish with the bottom crust, pressing it gently into the dish to ensure it covers the entire surface.
5. Prepare the filling by cooking the meat, poultry, or fish according to your preferred method. Season the filling with salt, pepper, herbs, and spices to taste.
6. Spoon the filling into the pie dish, spreading it evenly.
7. Place the top crust over the filling, pressing the edges of the top and bottom crusts together to seal the pie.
8. Use a sharp knife to make a few small slits in the top crust to allow steam to escape during baking.
9. Place the pie dish on a baking sheet to catch any drips.
10. Bake the pie in the preheated oven for approximately 45-60 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown and the filling is cooked through.
11. Remove the pie from the oven and let it cool for a few minutes before serving.

## Cooking time
