# Conserve of Sage

## Description
Conserve of Sage is a sweet and aromatic spread made from fresh sage flowers and sugar. It is a traditional 18th-century recipe that was used to preserve the flavors of sage throughout the year.

## Ingredients:

- 450 grams sugar

## Instructions:
1. In a mortar, pound the fresh sage flowers until they are well crushed.
2. Add the sugar to the mortar and continue pounding until the sage flowers and sugar are well combined.
3. Transfer the mixture to a well-glazed pan.
4. Place the pan in a sunny spot, such as a windowsill or a sunny outdoor area.
5. Stir the mixture every day to ensure even drying and prevent clumping.
6. Allow the conserve to dry in the sun for several weeks until it reaches a thick, spreadable consistency.
7. Once the conserve has dried, transfer it to a clean, airtight jar for storage.

## Cooking time
Several weeks of drying in the sun.
