# Cullis of Crayfish Half Brown

## Description
Cullis of Crayfish Half Brown is a rich and flavorful sauce made from crayfish, veal, ham, and various vegetables. It is traditionally served as a sauce for fish or poultry dishes.

## Options and commentary
- Instead of crayfish, you can use shrimp or lobster as a substitute.
- If you prefer a smoother sauce, you can strain it after blending the ingredients.
- This recipe requires a mortar and pestle for pounding the ingredients, but you can also use a food processor for convenience.

## Ingredients:
- 500g crayfish (or shrimp/lobster)
- 12 blanched almonds
- Shells of the crayfish (or shrimp/lobster)
- 1 roasted chicken breast, minced
- 4 hard-boiled egg yolks
- 500g veal fillet, sliced
- 100g ham, sliced
- 2 carrots, sliced
- 2 parsnips, sliced
- 1 onion, sliced
- 2 slices of bacon, melted
- 1/2 tablespoon flour
- 500ml strong broth (chicken or vegetable)
- 2 French rolls, crust only
- A handful of mushrooms, sliced
- A handful of truffles, sliced
- 1 leek, whole
- A handful of parsley, chopped
- A few basil leaves
- 6 cloves

## Instructions:
1. Wash the crayfish thoroughly and boil them until cooked. Remove the flesh from the shells and set aside.
2. In a mortar (or food processor), pound the blanched almonds with the shells of the crayfish until finely ground.
3. In the same mortar (or food processor), pound the roasted chicken breast and hard-boiled egg yolks with the shells and almonds until well combined.
4. In a stew-pan, layer the sliced veal and ham at the bottom. Add the sliced carrots, parsnips, and onions on top.
5. Cover the pan and stew the ingredients over low heat. When the meat starts to stick to the bottom, add the melted bacon and flour. Stir continuously for about 7-8 turns.
6. Pour in the strong broth and add the crust of the French rolls, mushrooms, truffles, leek, parsley, basil, and cloves.
7. Simmer the mixture until the veal is cooked through.
8. Remove the veal, ham, and vegetables from the stew-pan.
9. Add the pounded shells, almonds, chicken, and egg mixture to the stew-pan. Mix well.
10. Strain the sauce and set it aside for later use.
