# Marinated Lobsters

## Description
This recipe involves parboiling lobsters, removing the meat from the tails, larding the tails with salted eel, frying them, and then making a flavorful sauce with various herbs and spices. The lobsters are then served with the sauce, sliced lemons, and butter.

## Options and commentary
- Instead of parboiling the lobsters, you can also steam them until they are cooked through.
- If you can't find salted eel, you can use bacon or pancetta as a substitute.
- Feel free to adjust the amount of herbs and spices in the sauce according to your taste preferences.
