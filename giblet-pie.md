# Giblet Pie

## Description
Giblet Pie is a traditional British dish made with stewed giblets (usually from poultry) and encased in a puff pastry crust. The giblets are cooked until tender and seasoned with salt, pepper, shallots, onion, and herbs. The pie is then assembled with layers of giblets, butter, hard-boiled egg yolks, and forcemeat balls. The pie is baked until the pastry is golden and flaky, and just before baking, a hole is made in the lid to pour in some of the stewing liquid.

## Ingredients:
- 500g giblets (chicken or turkey giblets)
- Salt, to taste
- Pepper, to taste
- 2-3 shallots, finely chopped
- 1 onion, quartered
- Fresh herbs (such as thyme, parsley, and sage), a small bunch
- Water, enough to cover the giblets
- Puff pastry, enough to cover the pie dish
- 50g butter, diced
- 2 hard-boiled egg yolks, sliced
- Forcemeat balls (optional)

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F).
2. In a large pot, add the giblets, salt, pepper, shallots, onion, and fresh herbs.
3. Pour in enough water to just cover the giblets.
4. Bring the pot to a boil over medium heat, then reduce the heat to low and simmer for about 1 hour or until the giblets are tender.
5. While the giblets are simmering, prepare the puff pastry. Roll out the pastry to fit the size of your pie dish.
6. Once the giblets are tender, remove them from the pot and set aside. Reserve half of the stewing liquid.
7. In the pie dish, layer the cooked giblets, diced butter, sliced hard-boiled egg yolks, and forcemeat balls (if using).
8. Place the puff pastry over the filling and seal the edges of the pie dish.
9. Make a hole in the center of the pastry lid to allow steam to escape during baking.
10. Pour half of the reserved stewing liquid into the hole in the pastry lid.
11. Place the pie in the preheated oven and bake for about 30-40 minutes or until the pastry is golden and cooked through.
12. Remove the pie from the oven and let it cool for a few minutes before serving.

## Cooking time
Approximately 1 hour 40 minutes (including simmering time for the giblets and baking time for the pie).
