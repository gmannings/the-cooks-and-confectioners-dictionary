# Roasted Hern

## Description
Roasted Hern is a dish made with a pickled and parboiled hern (heron) that is then roasted and basted with a mixture of white wine and butter. It is seasoned with minced sweet herbs and grated bread. The dish is served with a sauce made from beaten egg yolks, anchovies, claret, and vinegar. It is garnished with rosemary tops, savory, lemon, and orange.

## Ingredients:
- 1 hern (heron)
- White wine
- Butter
- Sweet herbs (such as parsley, thyme, and sage)
- Grated bread
- Egg yolks
- Anchovies
- Claret (red wine)
- Vinegar
- Rosemary tops
- Savory
- Lemon
- Orange

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 180째C (350째F).
2. Pick the hern, removing any feathers and cleaning it thoroughly.
3. Parboil the hern by placing it in a large pot of boiling water for about 10 minutes. This will help to partially cook the hern before roasting.
4. While the hern is parboiling, prepare the basting mixture. In a bowl, combine equal parts white wine and melted butter. Mix well.
5. Remove the hern from the pot and pat it dry with paper towels.
6. Lard the breast and back of the hern by inserting small strips of fat (such as bacon) into the meat.
7. Place the hern on a roasting rack in a roasting pan.
8. Baste the hern with the white wine and butter mixture, using a brush or spoon to evenly coat the surface.
9. Sprinkle the minced sweet herbs and grated bread over the hern, pressing them gently into the surface.
10. Place the roasting pan in the preheated oven and roast the hern for about 1 hour, or until the internal temperature reaches 75째C (165째F). Baste the hern with the basting mixture every 15 minutes to keep it moist and flavorful.
11. While the hern is roasting, prepare the sauce. In a separate bowl, beat the egg yolks until smooth. Add finely chopped anchovies, a splash of claret, and a splash of vinegar. Mix well to combine.
12. When the hern is fully cooked, remove it from the oven and let it rest for a few minutes.
13. Slice the hern into serving portions and arrange them on a serving platter.
14. Pour the sauce over the sliced hern, allowing it to coat the meat.
15. Garnish the dish with rosemary tops, savory leaves, lemon slices, and orange slices.
16. Serve the roasted hern immediately.
