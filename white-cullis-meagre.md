## Description

3. In a mortar, pound the blanched almonds until they form a paste.
4. In a separate bowl, mash the hard-boiled egg yolks.
5. In a stewpan, melt some butter and add the sliced parsnips, carrots, and onions. Cook them over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until they begin to brown.
6. Add the almond paste and mashed egg yolks to the stewpan. Stir well to combine.
7. Gradually add the fish broth or vegetable broth to the stewpan, stirring constantly. Continue cooking until the mixture thickens slightly.
8. Add the flaked fish to the stewpan and stir gently to combine. Cook for an additional 5 minutes to heat the fish through.
