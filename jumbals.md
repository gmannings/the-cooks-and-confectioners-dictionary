# Jumbals

## Description
Jumbals are a type of sweet biscuit or cookie that originated in the 18th century. They are made with a simple dough that is flavored with rosewater and baked until golden and crisp. Jumbals can be shaped into various forms, such as rounds, twists, or knots, and are perfect for enjoying with a cup of tea or coffee.

## Ingredients:
- 450g fine flour
- 340g fresh butter
- 340g sugar
- 6 eggs (3 whole eggs and 3 egg whites)
- 6 tablespoons rosewater

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F) and line baking sheets with parchment paper.
2. In a large bowl, combine the flour and sugar.
3. Cut the butter into small pieces and add it to the bowl.
4. Rub the butter into the flour and sugar mixture using your fingertips until it resembles coarse crumbs.
5. In a separate bowl, lightly beat the 3 whole eggs and 3 egg whites together.
6. Add the beaten eggs and rosewater to the flour mixture.
7. Mix everything together until a dough forms. If the dough is too dry, you can add a little more rosewater.
8. Divide the dough into smaller portions and shape them into your desired forms, such as rounds, twists, or knots.
9. Place the shaped dough onto the prepared baking sheets, leaving some space between each piece.
10. Bake in the preheated oven for about 15-20 minutes, or until the jumbals are golden brown and crisp.
11. Remove from the oven and let them cool completely on a wire rack.
12. Once cooled, store the jumbals in an airtight container to keep them fresh.
