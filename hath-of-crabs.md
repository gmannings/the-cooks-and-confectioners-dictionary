## Ingredients:
- 2 crabs (or 1 cup crab meat)
- 1 cup diced pineapple
- 1/2 cup pistachios, chopped
- 1 cup canned artichoke hearts, drained and diced
- 1 cup asparagus, cut into 1/2-inch pieces
- 1 cup red wine
- 1/4 cup vinegar
- 1/4 cup butter
- Salt to taste
- 1/4 teaspoon grated nutmeg
- 1 orange, sliced
- Sippets or puff pastry for serving
- Fritters of Armes or fried shrimp/crab cakes for garnish
- Lemon slices for garnish
- Barberries, gooseberries, or grapes for garnish
- 2 tablespoons butter
- 2 egg yolks

## Instructions:
1. If using fresh crabs, boil them until cooked. Remove the meat from the claws and cut it into dice-sized pieces. If using canned crab meat, skip this step.
2. In a large saucepan, combine the crab meat, diced pineapple, chopped pistachios, diced artichoke hearts, and asparagus.
3. Pour in the red wine and vinegar. Add the butter, salt, grated nutmeg, and orange slices.
4. Place the saucepan over medium heat and bring the mixture to a simmer. Reduce the heat to low and let it stew for about 15-20 minutes, or until the flavors have melded together and the ingredients are cooked through.
5. While the mixture is stewing, prepare the sippets or puff pastry for serving.
6. In a separate pan, melt the 2 tablespoons of butter. Add the egg yolks and whisk until thickened.
7. Once the crab mixture is done stewing, remove the orange slices and discard them.
8. To serve, place the sippets or puff pastry on a plate. Spoon the crab mixture onto the sippets or puff pastry.
9. Garnish with fritters of Armes or fried shrimp/crab cakes, lemon slices, and barberries, gooseberries, or grapes.
10. Drizzle the melted butter and egg yolk mixture over the top of the dish.
