# Perfumed Water

## Description
Perfumed water was a popular fragrance in the 18th century. It was made by infusing various herbs, spices, and other aromatic ingredients in alcohol. This recipe calls for a combination of Benjamin, Storax, Calamint, Cloves, and Maftick, which are ground together and then infused in Aqua-vitae or Spirit of Wine. The mixture is then strained and a small amount of Musk is added for an extra touch of fragrance.

## Ingredients:
- 1 teaspoon Benjamin
- 1 teaspoon Storax
- 1 teaspoon Calamint
- 1 teaspoon Cloves
- 1 teaspoon Maftick
- 1 cup Aqua-vitae or Spirit of Wine
- 1 grain of Musk

## Instructions:
1. In a mortar, grind together Benjamin, Storax, Calamint, Cloves, and Maftick until they form a fine powder.
2. Transfer the powdered mixture into a glass vial.
3. Pour Aqua-vitae or Spirit of Wine into the vial, covering the powdered mixture completely.
4. Close the vial tightly and let it sit for several days, allowing the ingredients to infuse into the alcohol. The liquid will turn red in color.
5. After the infusion period, add a grain of Musk to the vial.
6. Strain the mixture through a fine mesh strainer or cheesecloth to remove any solid particles.
7. Transfer the perfumed water into a clean bottle or container for storage.
