# Crayfish Soup

## Description
Crayfish soup is a rich and flavorful seafood soup made with a variety of fish and shellfish. It is seasoned with spices and herbs, and served with crayfish tails and a stewed carp in the center.

## Options and commentary
- You can use any white fish fillets instead of whitings and thornback.
- If crayfish is not available, you can substitute it with shrimp or lobster.
- The soup can be served with crusty bread or rice on the side.
- Cooking time may vary depending on the size and type of fish used.

## Ingredients:
- 6 whitings
- 1 thornback ray
- 1 large eel
- Salt
- Whole pepper
- Ginger
- Mace
- 1 onion
- Cloves
- Thyme
- Parsley
- 50 crayfish
- Water
- Vinegar
- Lemon
- Faggot of sweet herbs
- 1 carp
- Good gravy
- Burnt butter

## Instructions:
1. Cleanse the whitings, thornback ray, and eel. Remove the heads, tails, and innards.
2. In a large pot, add enough water to cover the fish. Bring it to a boil and skim off any impurities that rise to the surface.
3. Season the boiling water with salt, whole pepper, ginger, mace, the onion stuck with cloves, thyme, and parsley.
4. Boil the fish until they are cooked through and can easily be mashed. This will take approximately 20-30 minutes.
5. While the fish is boiling, prepare the crayfish. Remove the tails and discard the bag and any woolly parts. Set the tails aside.
6. In a separate saucepan, combine water, vinegar, salt, lemon, and a faggot of sweet herbs. Bring it to a gentle simmer.
7. Add the crayfish tails to the saucepan and cook until they are almost ready to boil. Remove the tails and set them aside.
8. Take all the other crayfish shells and beat them with a French roll until they are finely crushed.
9. Wash out all the goodness from the shells by pouring their own liquor over them. Strain the mixture to remove any filth and grit.
10. In the meantime, stew a carp until it is cooked through.
11. Place the stewed carp in the middle of a serving dish.
12. Add the body of the lobster to the fish soup along with good gravy and burnt butter.
13. Heat the crayfish tails in the soup.
14. Pour the soup, including the crayfish tails, over the carp in the serving dish.
