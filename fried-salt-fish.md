# Fried Salt Fish

## Description
This recipe is for frying salt fish, which was a common dish in the 18th century. The salt fish is soaked in water to remove some of the saltiness, then sliced or fried whole. It is coated in flour and fried in clarified butter until it is browned. The dish is served dry, with a garnish of fried parsley.

## Ingredients:
- 1 salt fish tail
- Flour
- Clarified butter
- Fresh parsley

## Instructions:
1. Soak the salt fish tail in water for a few hours to remove some of the saltiness. Change the water a few times during the soaking process.
2. Once the fish has soaked, remove it from the water and pat it dry with paper towels.
3. Cut the salt fish into slices, or leave it whole if desired.
4. Coat the salt fish with flour, shaking off any excess.
5. Heat a frying pan over medium heat and add enough clarified butter to cover the bottom of the pan.
6. Place the coated salt fish in the pan and fry until it is browned on both sides. This will take about 3-4 minutes per side.
7. While the fish is frying, prepare the fried parsley. Heat a small amount of clarified butter in a separate pan and add fresh parsley leaves. Fry the parsley until it is crispy.
8. Once the salt fish is cooked, remove it from the pan and place it on a paper towel-lined plate to drain any excess oil.
9. Serve the fried salt fish dry, with the fried parsley as a garnish.

## Cooking time
Approximately 10-15 minutes.
