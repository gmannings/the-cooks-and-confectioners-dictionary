# Baked Beef with Rye Pastry

## Description
This recipe is for a baked beef dish that is meant to be eaten cold. The beef is first beaten and broiled, then marinated in a mixture of wine vinegar, salt, pepper, cloves, mace, and bay leaves. It is then baked in a rye pastry crust, cooled, and filled with butter. The dish is then left to stand for a period of time before it is ready to be eaten.

## Ingredients:
- 1 buttock of beef
- Wine vinegar
- Salt
- Pepper
- Cloves
- Mace
- 2-3 bay leaves
- Rye pastry
- Butter

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to the appropriate temperature for baking the rye pastry (follow the instructions on the pastry package).
2. Cut the buttock of beef lengthwise with the grain.
3. Place the beef on a cutting board and beat it well with a rolling pin to tenderize it.
4. Preheat a grill or broiler and cook the beef until it is cooked through. Allow it to cool completely.
5. In a container or dish, combine wine vinegar, salt, pepper, cloves, mace, and bay leaves to create a marinade.
6. Place the cooked beef in the marinade, ensuring it is fully submerged. Cover the container or dish and refrigerate for three to four days, allowing the beef to marinate.
7. Preheat the oven to the temperature specified for baking the rye pastry.
8. Roll out the rye pastry and line a baking dish or pie tin with it.
9. Remove the beef from the marinade and place it in the lined baking dish.
10. Cover the beef with the remaining rye pastry, sealing the edges.
11. Bake the beef in the preheated oven for the specified time for baking the rye pastry (follow the instructions on the pastry package).
12. Once baked, remove the beef from the oven and allow it to cool completely.
13. Once cooled, carefully remove the top layer of the rye pastry.
14. Fill the cavity of the beef with butter, ensuring it is evenly distributed.
15. Place the top layer of the rye pastry back on the beef, sealing it.
16. Allow the beef to stand for twelve to fourteen days to develop flavor.
17. Serve the baked beef cold.
