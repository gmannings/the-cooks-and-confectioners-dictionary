# Turbot in White Wine Sauce

## Description
This recipe is a modern take on the 18th-century dish "Turbot in White Wine Sauce." Turbot is cooked in a flavorful mixture of white wine, vinegar, verjuice, and lemon, and seasoned with salt, pepper, cloves, onions, and a bay leaf. The addition of milk helps to keep the fish tender and gives it a creamy texture. The dish is garnished with slices of lemon, parsley, and violets (when in season).

## Options and commentary
- Turbot can be substituted with other firm white fish such as halibut or cod.
- If verjuice is not available, you can use a combination of white wine and lemon juice.
- Violets can be omitted if not in season or replaced with another edible flower for garnish.

## Ingredients:
- 1 turbot fillet (or other firm white fish)
- 1 cup white wine
- 1/4 cup vinegar
