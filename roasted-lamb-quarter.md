# Roasted Lamb Quarter

## Description
This recipe is for roasting a lamb quarter. The lamb is prepared by larding one half of the quarter and coating the other half with grated bread. It is then roasted on a spit, wrapped in paper to prevent scorching. Towards the end of the roasting process, the unlarded part is coated with bread crumbs, salt, and finely shredded parsley.

## Options and commentary
- You can use bone-in or boneless lamb quarter, depending on your preference.
- If you don't have a spit, you can roast the lamb in the oven.
- Feel free to adjust the amount of salt and parsley according to your taste.

## Ingredients:
- 1 lamb quarter (bone-in or boneless)
- Larding fat (such as bacon fat or butter)
- Grated bread
- Salt
- Fresh parsley

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F) if roasting in the oven. If using a spit, prepare the spit according to the manufacturer's instructions.
2. If using a bone-in lamb quarter, lard one half of the quarter by inserting small strips of larding fat into the meat. If using a boneless lamb quarter, skip this step.
3. Coat the other half of the lamb quarter with grated bread, pressing it gently onto the meat to adhere.
4. If roasting in the oven, place the lamb quarter on a roasting rack in a roasting pan. If using a spit, secure the lamb quarter onto the spit.
5. If roasting in the oven, cover the lamb quarter loosely with aluminum foil. If using a spit, wrap the lamb quarter in parchment paper.
6. Place the lamb quarter in the preheated oven or on the spit and roast for about 20 minutes per 500g (1 pound) of meat, or until the internal temperature reaches your desired level of doneness. If roasting in the oven, remove the foil during the last 20 minutes of cooking to allow the bread coating to crisp up.
7. While the lamb is roasting, prepare the bread crumb coating for the unlarded part. In a bowl, combine grated bread, a pinch of salt, and finely shredded parsley.
8. When the lamb is almost done, remove it from the oven or spit. Carefully remove the paper if using a spit.
9. Sprinkle the bread crumb mixture over the unlarded part of the lamb, pressing it gently onto the meat.
10. Return the lamb to the oven or spit and continue roasting for another 10-15 minutes, or until the bread crumb coating is golden brown and crispy.
11. Remove the lamb from the oven or spit and let it rest for a few minutes before carving.
12. Carve the lamb quarter into slices and serve hot.
