# Hotch-pot of Beef

## Description
Hotch-pot of Beef is a hearty stew made with a combination of beef, mutton, and veal, cooked together with vegetables and herbs. The dish is simmered until the meat is tender and the flavors have melded together. It is traditionally served on sippets, which are small pieces of toasted bread.

## Options and commentary
- You can use any cuts of beef, mutton, and veal that you prefer. Brisket, chuck, or stewing beef are good options for the beef. Lamb shoulder or leg can be used for the mutton, and veal shoulder or shank can be used for the veal.
- Feel free to add other vegetables such as onions, leeks, or potatoes to the stew for added flavor and texture.
- You can adjust the seasoning according to your taste preferences. Add more salt and pepper if desired, or even add other herbs and spices such as thyme or bay leaves.
