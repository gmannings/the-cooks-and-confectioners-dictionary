# Salamougundy (Salmongundin, Salgundy)

## Description
Salamougundy is a traditional 18th-century dish consisting of lettuce, sliced roasted chicken or pullet, anchovies, diced lemon, minced hard-boiled eggs, and onions. It is garnished with grapes, blanched French beans, or station flowers and dressed with a salad oil and vinegar dressing. Salamougundy is typically served as a first course.

## Ingredients:
- 2-3 Roman or cabbage lettuce
- 2 cold roasted pullets or chickens
- 6 anchovies
- 4 hard-boiled eggs
- 1 lemon
- Small onions (as big as the yolks of eggs)
- Sallet oil (salad oil)
- Vinegar
- Salt
- Pepper
- Grapes (scalded)
- French beans (blanched)
- Station flowers

## Instructions:
1. Wash the lettuce thoroughly and pat dry with a cloth.
2. Cut the lettuce crossways into fine threads, about the thickness of a good big thread.
3. Arrange the cut lettuce in a layer about 1 inch thick at the bottom of a dish.
4. Slice the flesh of the breasts and wings of the roasted pullets or chickens into slices about 3 inches long, 1/4 inch broad, and as thin as a shilling.
5. Place the sliced chicken around one end of the dish, towards the middle, and the other end towards the brim.
6. Bone and cut the anchovies into 8 pieces each.
7. Place the anchovy pieces between each slice of chicken.
8. Dice the lean meat of the pullets or chickens' legs into small dice.
9. Dice the lemon into small dice.
10. Mince the yolks of 4 hard-boiled eggs with 3-4 anchovies and a little parsley.
11. Create a round heap in the middle of the dish with the minced egg mixture, piling it up in the form of a sugar-loaf.
12. Garnish the minced meat heap with small onions, boiled until tender and white, as big as the yolks of eggs. Place the largest onion on top of the minced meat heap and the rest around the brim of the dish as thick as possible.
13. In a separate bowl, whisk together salad oil, vinegar, salt, and pepper to make a dressing.
14. Pour the dressing over the salamougundy.
15. Garnish with scalded grapes, blanched French beans, or station flowers.
16. Serve the salamougundy hot as a first course.
