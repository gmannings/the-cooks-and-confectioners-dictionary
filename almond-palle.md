# Almond Palle

## Description
Almond Palle is a sweet treat made from pounded almonds, sugar, and flavorings. The almonds are scalded, washed, and then pounded in a mortar until smooth. The paste is then spread on a dish and dried with sugar until it becomes pliable.

## Ingredients:
- 200g almonds
- 1 egg white
- 1 teaspoon orange flower water
- 100g fine sugar

## Instructions:
1. Bring a pot of water to a boil. Add the almonds and let them boil for 1 minute. Drain the almonds and rinse them with cold water.
2. Remove the skins from the almonds by gently squeezing them. The skins should easily slip off.
3. Place the blanched almonds in a mortar and pound them until they form a smooth paste. This may take some time, but the almonds cannot be pounded too much.
4. In a small bowl, whisk together the egg white and orange flower water.
5. Gradually add the egg white mixture to the pounded almonds, moistening the paste as you go. This will prevent the almonds from turning into oil.
6. Once the paste is well combined and pliable, spread it onto a large dish.
7. Sprinkle the fine sugar over the top of the paste, covering it completely.
8. Let the paste dry with the sugar for a little while until it becomes as pliable as ordinary paste.
9. Once dried, the Almond Palle is ready to be used.

## Cooking time
Approximately 30 minutes to prepare and dry the Almond Palle.
