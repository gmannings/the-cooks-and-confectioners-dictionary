# Apricot Candy

## Description
This recipe is for making apricot candy, a sweet and transparent treat made from apricots and sugar. The candy has a marmalade-like consistency and is shaped into the form of apricots. 

## Ingredients:
- Apricots

## Instructions:
1. Peel the apricots and remove the stones.

4. Lay the cooked apricots out on white paper to dry.
5. In a separate pot, boil an equal weight of sugar with a mixture of rose water and water until it reaches the candy stage (approximately 300°F or 150°C).
6. Add the cooked apricots to the pot with the sugar syrup and continue boiling, stirring constantly, until the mixture thickens to the consistency of marmalade.
7. Remove the mixture from the heat and allow it to cool slightly.
