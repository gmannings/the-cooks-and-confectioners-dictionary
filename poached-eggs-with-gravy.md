# Poached Eggs with Gravy

## Description
This recipe is a simple and comforting dish of poached eggs served with a flavorful gravy. The eggs are gently cooked in simmering water until the whites are set and the yolks are still runny. The gravy is made with a combination of broth or stock, seasoned with salt, pepper, and a whole leek for added flavor. The poached eggs are then placed in a dish and the gravy is strained over them, creating a delicious and satisfying meal.

## Ingredients:
- 4 eggs
- 2 cups broth or stock (chicken, vegetable, or beef)
- 1 leek, washed and trimmed
- Salt, to taste
- Pepper, to taste

## Instructions:
1. Fill a large saucepan with water and bring it to a gentle simmer over medium heat.
2. Crack each egg into a small bowl or ramekin, taking care not to break the yolks.
3. Carefully slide each egg into the simmering water, one at a time. Cook for about 3-4 minutes, or until the whites are set but the yolks are still runny.
4. While the eggs are poaching, prepare the gravy. In a separate saucepan, heat the broth or stock over medium heat.
5. Add the whole leek to the broth or stock and season with salt and pepper. Allow the mixture to simmer for about 10 minutes to infuse the flavors.
6. Remove the leek from the broth or stock and discard.
7. Place a fine-mesh sieve over a bowl or another saucepan. Carefully pour the hot gravy through the sieve to strain out any solids.
8. Once the eggs are poached, use a slotted spoon to remove them from the water and transfer them to a serving dish.
9. Pour the strained gravy over the poached eggs, ensuring that each egg is coated with the flavorful sauce.
10. Serve the poached eggs with gravy hot in individual dishes or plates.
