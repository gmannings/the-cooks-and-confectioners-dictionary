# May Dew Grease

## Description
May Dew Grease is a traditional recipe for clarifying and whitening lard or grease. It involves washing the fat in dew, macerating marshmallow roots, and beating the mixture until it is cold. The final product can be stored in a glass jar and used for cooking.

## Ingredients:
- Barrows grease or lard
- May Dew (clarified in the sun)
- Roots of marshmallows

## Instructions:
1. Take the Barrows grease or lard and wash it multiple times in May Dew. Make sure to clarify the May Dew by leaving it in the sun.
2. Scrape the roots of marshmallows and cut them into thin slices.
3. Place the marshmallow slices in a water bath (Balneo) and let them macerate.
4. Skim off any impurities that rise to the surface of the water bath until it is clarified and reaches a rope-like consistency.
5. Strain the mixture to remove any solids.
6. Add a spoonful or two of May Dew to the strained mixture and continue beating it until it is thoroughly cold. You can achieve this by frequently changing the May Dew.
7. Discard the May Dew used for beating and transfer the clarified grease or lard to a glass jar.
