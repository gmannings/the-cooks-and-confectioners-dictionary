# Pear-palte

## Description
Pear-palte is a sweet fruit paste made from pears and sugar. It has a smooth and velvety texture, and a sweet and fruity flavor. It can be enjoyed on its own as a dessert or used as a filling for pastries and cakes.

## Ingredients:
- 1 kg pears
- 1 kg sugar

## Instructions:
1. Peel and core the pears, then cut them into small pieces.
2. Place the pear pieces in a large pot and cover them with water.
3. Bring the water to a boil and let the pears simmer until they are soft and easily mashed with a fork.
4. Drain the cooked pears and pass them through a sieve to remove any lumps or fibers.
5. Transfer the pear puree back to the pot and place it over low heat.
6. Stir the pear puree constantly with a spatula, making sure to scrape the bottom and sides of the pot to prevent burning.
7. Continue cooking the pear puree until it thickens and starts to pull away from the sides of the pot.
8. While the pear puree is cooking, prepare the sugar by heating it in a separate pan until it reaches the "feathered" or "cracked" stage. This means that the sugar has melted and caramelized to a golden brown color.
9. Once the pear puree has thickened, remove it from the heat and gradually add the prepared sugar, stirring well to combine.
10. Return the pot to low heat and let the mixture simmer for a few more minutes to ensure that the sugar is fully incorporated.
11. Remove the pot from the heat and let the pear-palte cool slightly.
12. Spoon the pear-palte into molds or onto slates, shaping it as desired.
13. Place the molds or slates in a warm and dry place, such as an oven set to a low temperature, to dry and set the pear-palte.
14. Allow the pear-palte to dry completely before removing it from the molds or slates.
