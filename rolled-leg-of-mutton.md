# Rolled Leg of Mutton

## Description
This recipe involves preparing a leg of mutton by removing the skin, flesh, and fat from the shank bone. The flesh is then spread out and larded with bacon. A mixture of minced veal (or breast of a fowl), blanched bacon, beef suet, mushrooms, cives, parsley, salt, pepper, spices, herbs, egg yolks, and soaked French roll crumbs is spread on the mutton. The mutton is then rolled up, tied with tape, and placed in a stewpan with layers of bacon, beef or veal slices, onion, parsnip, carrot, salt, pepper, spices, bay leaves, parsley, and cives. The stewpan is covered and the mutton is braised or cooked with fire underneath and over it. Once cooked, it is served with a ragout.

## Options and commentary
- Instead of larding the mutton with bacon, you can use thin strips of pancetta or prosciutto.
- The minced mixture can be customized with additional herbs and spices according to personal preference.
- The stewpan can be replaced with a Dutch oven or a roasting pan if braising or roasting respectively.

## Ingredients:
- 1 leg of mutton
- Bacon or pancetta slices for larding
- 200g veal or breast of a fowl, minced
- 100g blanched bacon, minced
- 50g beef suet, minced
- 50g mushrooms, minced
- 2 tablespoons cives, minced
- 2 tablespoons parsley, minced
- Salt and pepper to taste
- Assorted spices (such as cloves, nutmeg, and cinnamon) to taste
- 3-4 egg yolks
- 1 French roll, soaked in cream and crumbled
- Slices of beef or veal for layering
- Slices of onion, parsnip, and carrot for layering
- Bay leaves for layering
- Additional parsley and cives for layering

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F) if roasting the mutton or prepare a stovetop for braising.
2. Remove the skin, flesh, and fat from the shank bone of the leg of mutton.
3. Cut the flesh down to the middle bone and remove the bone, leaving the flesh hanging to the shank bone.
4. Spread the flesh out until it is about an inch thick and suitable for the size of the dish you plan to serve it in.
5. Lard the mutton by inserting large lardons of bacon into the flesh.
6. In a mortar, pound together the minced veal (or breast of a fowl), blanched bacon, beef suet, mushrooms, cives, parsley, salt, pepper, spices, and herbs.
7. Add the egg yolks and soaked French roll crumbs to the mortar and continue pounding until well combined.
8. Spread the minced mixture evenly over the larded mutton.
9. Roll up the mutton, ensuring that it retains its original shape, and tie it securely with kitchen twine.
10. In a stewpan, layer the bottom with bacon slices and top with slices of beef or veal.
11. Place slices of onion, parsnip, and carrot on top of the meat layers.
12. Season the layers with salt, pepper, spices, bay leaves, parsley, and cives.
13. Place the rolled mutton on top of the layered ingredients in the stewpan.
14. Cover the mutton with additional seasoning, beef or veal slices, and bacon.
15. Cover the stewpan with a lid and either braise it in the oven for approximately 2-3 hours or cook it on the stovetop over low heat for the same amount of time, ensuring the fire is both underneath and over the stewpan.
16. Once the mutton is cooked to your desired tenderness, remove it from the stewpan and let it rest for a few minutes.
17. Serve the rolled leg of mutton with the same ragout as directed in the recipe for a leg of mutton dressed a la Royale.
