# Pickled Hop Buds

## Description
Pickled hop buds are a tangy and flavorful condiment that can be used to add a unique twist to various dishes. These pickled buds are made by soaking hop buds in a mixture of water, salt, and white wine vinegar. The pickling process enhances the natural bitterness of the hops and adds a deliciously tart and acidic flavor.

## Ingredients:
- Fresh hop buds
- Water
- Salt
- White wine vinegar

## Instructions:
1. Start by giving the hop buds a quick rinse under cold water to remove any dirt or debris.
2. In a large bowl, combine water and salt. Use approximately 1 tablespoon of salt for every cup of water. Stir until the salt is dissolved.
3. Place the hop buds in the saltwater mixture and let them soak for a couple of minutes. This will help to remove any bitterness from the hops.
4. Drain the hop buds and transfer them to a clean glass jar or container.
5. Pour enough white wine vinegar over the hop buds to completely cover them. Make sure the hop buds are fully submerged in the vinegar.
6. Seal the jar or container tightly with a lid.
7. Place the pickled hop buds in the refrigerator and let them marinate for at least 24 hours before using. The longer they sit, the more flavorful they will become.
8. Once pickled, the hop buds can be stored in the refrigerator for up to several weeks.
