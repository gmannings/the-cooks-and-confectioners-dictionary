# Roasted Filet of Beef

## Description
This recipe is for roasting a filet of beef, which is the tenderest part of the ox. The filet is located inside the sirloin, next to the chine. The beef is roasted gently and basted with butter to keep it moist. A flavorful sauce is made with sweet herbs, parsley, egg yolks, onion, and orange peel, which is then combined with butter, gravy, broth, and vinegar. The roasted beef is served in the sauce.

## Ingredients:
- 1 filet of beef (approximately 1 kg)
- Butter, for basting
- Salt and pepper, to taste
- For the sauce:
  - Sweet herbs (such as thyme, rosemary, and sage), finely chopped
  - Parsley, finely chopped
  - 3-4 egg yolks
  - 1 onion, minced
  - Peel of 1 orange, minced
  - 50g butter
  - 250ml gravy
  - 2-3 tablespoons strong broth
  - 2 tablespoons vinegar

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 180Â°C.
2. Place the filet of beef on a small spit, making sure not to run it through the best part of the meat.
3. Season the beef with salt and pepper.
4. Place the spit with the beef in the preheated oven and roast it gently for approximately 20 minutes per 500g of meat, or until the desired level of doneness is reached. Baste the beef with butter every 10-15 minutes to keep it moist.
5. While the beef is roasting, prepare the sauce. In a saucepan, melt the butter over medium heat.
6. Add the sweet herbs, parsley, minced onion, and minced orange peel to the melted butter. Cook for a few minutes until the herbs and onion are fragrant.
7. In a separate bowl, whisk together the egg yolks.
8. Gradually add the gravy, strong broth, and vinegar to the egg yolks, whisking constantly to prevent curdling.
9. Pour the egg yolk mixture into the saucepan with the herb and onion mixture. Stir well to combine.
10. Reduce the heat to low and simmer the sauce for 5-10 minutes, stirring occasionally, until it thickens slightly.
11. Once the beef is cooked to your desired level of doneness, remove it from the oven and let it rest for a few minutes.
12. Slice the roasted beef and transfer it to the saucepan with the sauce. Gently stir to coat the beef with the sauce.
13. Serve the roasted filet of beef hot, with the sauce, at the table.

## Cooking time
Approximately 20 minutes per 500g of beef, plus additional time for preparation and resting.
