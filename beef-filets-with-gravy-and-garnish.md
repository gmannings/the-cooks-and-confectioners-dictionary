# Beef Filets with Gravy and Garnish

## Description
This recipe features beef filets that are marinated and roasted, then served with a flavorful gravy and garnished with fricandoes or marinated chickens or pigeons. It is a hearty and delicious dish that can be served as a main course.

## Options and commentary
- Instead of beef filets, you can use beef tenderloin or sirloin steaks.
- If you don't have truffles, you can omit them or substitute with mushrooms.
- Fricandoes are small pieces of meat that are braised and served in a sauce. You can use beef, chicken, or veal for the fricandoes.
- If you prefer, you can use marinated chickens or pigeons as the garnish instead of fricandoes.

## Ingredients:
- 4 beef filets (or beef tenderloin/sirloin steaks)
- 2 tablespoons vinegar
- Salt and pepper to taste
- 4 cloves
- 1 onion, sliced
- 1 sprig of thyme
- 1 cup beef or vegetable broth
- 4 truffles (or mushrooms), sliced
- Fricandoes or marinated chickens or pigeons for garnish

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F).
2. In a bowl, combine the vinegar, salt, pepper, cloves, sliced onion, and thyme. Mix well.
3. Place the beef filets in the marinade and let them marinate for at least 30 minutes.
4. Heat a frying pan over medium-high heat. Remove the beef filets from the marinade and sear them on both sides until browned. This will help seal in the juices.
5. Transfer the seared beef filets to a roasting pan and roast them in the preheated oven for about 15-20 minutes, or until cooked to your desired level of doneness. The cooking time may vary depending on the thickness of the filets.
6. While the beef is roasting, prepare the gravy. In a saucepan, heat the beef or vegetable broth over medium heat. Add the sliced truffles (or mushrooms) and simmer for about 10 minutes to infuse the flavors.
7. Once the beef filets are cooked, remove them from the oven and let them rest for a few minutes.
8. Slice the beef filets into thick slices and arrange them on a serving platter.
9. Pour the prepared gravy over the beef slices.
10. Garnish the dish with fricandoes or marinated chickens or pigeons.
11. Serve hot and enjoy!

## Cooking time
Approximately 30-40 minutes, depending on the desired level of doneness for the beef filets.
