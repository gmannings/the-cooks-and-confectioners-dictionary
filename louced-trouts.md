## Ingredients:
- 4 trout fillets
- 1 cup white wine vinegar
- 1 cup water
- 1 teaspoon whole peppercorns
- 1 teaspoon ground mace
- 1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg
- 1/2 teaspoon whole cloves
- 1/2 teaspoon ground ginger
- 1 small lemon, peel only
- 1 small onion, sliced
- 1 sprig rosemary
- 1 sprig savory
- 1 sprig thyme
- Salt, to taste
- 1 tablespoon white wine
- 1 tablespoon anchovy paste
- 1/2 teaspoon ground mace
- 1 tablespoon butter
- Optional: Oysters or shrimps

## Instructions:
1. In a large pot, combine the white wine vinegar, water, whole peppercorns, ground mace, ground nutmeg, whole cloves, ground ginger, lemon peel, sliced onion, rosemary, savory, thyme, and salt. Bring the mixture to a boil.
2. Reduce the heat to low and let the mixture simmer for about 10 minutes to allow the flavors to infuse.
3. Gently add the trout fillets to the simmering liquid. Make sure the fillets are fully submerged in the liquid.
4. Poach the trout fillets in the liquid for about 5-7 minutes, or until they are cooked through and flake easily with a fork.
5. Once the trout is cooked, carefully remove the fillets from the liquid and set them aside to cool.
6. Transfer the poaching liquid (sauce) to an earthenware or glass pan and let it cool.
7. To make the sauce, take a small amount of the poaching liquid and combine it with white wine, anchovy paste, and ground mace in a saucepan. Cook the mixture over low heat for a few minutes to allow the flavors to meld together.
8. Add the butter to the saucepan and stir until melted and well combined.
9. If desired, you can add oysters or shrimps to the sauce and cook them for a few minutes until they are heated through.
10. Serve the cooled trout fillets with the sauce poured over the top.
