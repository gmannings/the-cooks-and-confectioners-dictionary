# Veal a la Bourguignonne

## Description
Veal a la Bourguignonne is a classic French dish made with tender veal slices that are seasoned, larded with bacon, and slowly cooked in a flavorful broth. The veal is then finished with a rich sauce made from egg yolks and verjuice, resulting in a delicious and comforting dish.

## Ingredients:
- 500g veal slices (approximately 1 inch thick)
- 100g bacon, cut into lardons
- Salt and pepper to taste
- 1 teaspoon mixed spices (such as thyme, rosemary, and bay leaves), finely chopped
- 2 tablespoons parsley, finely chopped
- 4 slices of bacon, for garnish
- 1 tablespoon flour
- 500ml good quality broth (such as beef or veal)
- 2-3 egg yolks
- 2 tablespoons verjuice (or substitute with white wine or lemon juice)

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F).

2. Season the veal slices with salt, pepper, mixed spices, parsley, and cives. 

3. Lard the veal slices by inserting the bacon lardons into the meat.

4. Line the bottom of a large, oven-safe stew-pan with the slices of bacon.

5. Place the seasoned and larded veal slices on top of the bacon slices.

6. Set the stew-pan over a gentle fire and allow the veal to sweat for a few minutes.

7. Increase the heat to medium-high and brown the veal slices on both sides.

8. Sprinkle the flour over the veal slices and cook for a minute to brown the flour.

9. Pour in the broth to moisten the veal slices and bring to a gentle simmer.

10. Cover the stew-pan with a lid and transfer it to the preheated oven.

11. Allow the veal to stew in the oven for approximately 1.5 to 2 hours, or until the meat is tender and cooked through.

12. Once the veal is cooked, remove any excess fat from the surface of the stew.

13. In a small bowl, whisk together the egg yolks and verjuice until well combined.

14. Gradually pour the egg yolk mixture into the stew, stirring constantly, to thicken the sauce.

15. Remove the stew-pan from the heat and transfer the veal slices to a serving dish.

16. Pour the sauce over the veal slices and garnish with fresh parsley, if desired.

17. Serve the Veal a la Bourguignonne hot with crusty bread or mashed potatoes.
