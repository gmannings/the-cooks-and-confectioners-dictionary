# Palle of Currans

## Description
Palle of Currans is a sweet confection made from currants and sugar. It is similar to currant marmalade but has a firmer texture.

## Ingredients:
- 500g currants
- 500g sugar

## Instructions:
1. Place the currants in a pan and heat them over medium heat until they release their juice. 
2. Transfer the currants to a sieve and let them cool.
3. Once cooled, strain the currants through the sieve to remove any solids.
4. Place the strained currants back into the pan and dry them over low heat, stirring occasionally, until they have a slightly sticky consistency.
5. In the meantime, weigh out an equal amount of sugar as the currants (500g) and place it in a separate pan.
6. Heat the sugar over medium heat, stirring constantly, until it reaches the "crack" stage on a candy thermometer. This is approximately 150°C (300°F).
7. Once the sugar has reached the desired temperature, remove it from the heat and quickly stir in the dried currants.
8. Return the pan to the heat and simmer the mixture for a few minutes to ensure the currants are evenly coated with the sugar syrup.
9. While the currant mixture is simmering, prepare a baking sheet lined with parchment paper.
10. Pour the currant mixture onto the prepared baking sheet and spread it out evenly to form a thin layer.
11. Place the baking sheet in a low-temperature oven or food dehydrator to dry the currant mixture. This can take several hours or overnight.
12. Once the currant mixture is completely dry and firm, remove it from the oven and let it cool.
13. Cut the dried currant mixture into small squares or desired shapes.
14. Store the Palle of Currans in an airtight container.

## Cooking time
Several hours or overnight for drying the currant mixture.
