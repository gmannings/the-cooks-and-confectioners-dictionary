## Ingredients:

- Bolonia sausages
- Interlarded bacon
- Greens (such as lettuce or spinach)
- Edible flowers

## Instructions:
1. Break the bones of the bullock's head so that the flesh is as little mangled as possible.

9. Once the bullock's head is cooked, carefully remove it from the pot and place it on the serving platter with the greens and flowers.
10. Serve the bullock's head garnished with the greens and flowers.
11. In separate saucers, serve mustard and sugar as condiments to accompany the dish.
