# Oven-Dried Artichoke Bottoms

## Description
This recipe is a method for preserving artichoke bottoms by drying them in the oven. The dried artichokes can be stored and rehydrated later for use in various dishes.

## Options and commentary
- This recipe is specifically for artichoke bottoms, but you can also use whole artichokes if desired.
- The dried artichokes can be used in soups, stews, salads, or as a side dish.
- The drying process can take several hours, so plan accordingly.

## Ingredients:
- Artichoke bottoms
- Flour

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 120°C (250°F).
2. Take the artichoke bottoms and use a sharp knife to cut off the leaves and chokes.
3. Immediately place the artichoke bottoms in a bowl of water to prevent them from turning black.
4. Remove the artichoke bottoms from the water and coat them evenly with flour.
5. Arrange the flour-coated artichoke bottoms in a single layer on a baking sheet or wire rack.
6. Place the baking sheet or wire rack in the preheated oven and dry the artichoke bottoms for several hours, or until they are completely dried and crispy. This can take anywhere from 4 to 8 hours, depending on the size and moisture content of the artichokes.
7. Once the artichoke bottoms are dried, remove them from the oven and let them cool completely.
8. Store the dried artichoke bottoms in an airtight container until ready to use.
