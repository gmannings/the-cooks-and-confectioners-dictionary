# Pork, Veal, and Mutton Broth

## Description
This recipe is for a rich and flavorful broth made from a combination of pork, veal, and mutton. It is seasoned with white wine, sugar, eggs, nutmeg, ginger, cinnamon, and mace.

## Ingredients:
- 500g pork loin
- 500g veal shoulder
- 500g mutton shoulder
- 2 liters water
- 250ml white wine
- 100g double-refined sugar
- 4 eggs
- 1/2 teaspoon grated nutmeg
- 1-2 pieces of ginger, sliced
- 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
- 1/2 teaspoon ground mace

## Instructions:
1. In a large pot, combine the pork loin, veal shoulder, and mutton shoulder. Add enough water to cover the meat.
2. Bring the pot to a boil over high heat, then reduce the heat to low and simmer for several hours, until the broth is rich and flavorful.
3. Skim off any impurities that rise to the surface of the broth during cooking.
4. Once the broth is done, strain it through a fine mesh sieve to remove any solids.
5. Return the strained broth to the pot and place it over medium heat.
6. Add the white wine and double-refined sugar to the pot, stirring until the sugar is dissolved.
7. In a separate bowl, beat the eggs until well combined.
8. Gradually pour the beaten eggs into the pot, stirring constantly to prevent them from curdling.
9. Add the grated nutmeg, sliced ginger, ground cinnamon, and ground mace to the pot, stirring to incorporate.
10. Continue to cook the broth over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until it thickens slightly and the flavors meld together.
11. Taste the broth and adjust the seasoning if needed.
12. Once the broth is ready, strain it again to remove any solids or impurities.
13. Serve the broth hot as a comforting and flavorful soup base, or use it as a cooking liquid for other dishes.

## Cooking time
Several hours for simmering the meat, plus additional time for straining and seasoning the broth.
