# Cobrew Ale Sir Jonas Moore's Way

## Description
This recipe is for brewing ale using Sir Jonas Moore's method from the 18th century. It requires a specific ratio of malt to liquor and involves multiple steps to create three different worts.

## Options and commentary
- This recipe assumes you have access to a mashing tub and the necessary brewing equipment.
- Adjust the quantities of malt and liquor based on the desired batch size.
- The recipe mentions three worts, but you can choose to make only one or two if desired.

## Ingredients:
- 5.5 bushels (approximately 195 kilograms) of malt
- 45 gallons (approximately 170 liters) of water (liquor)

## Instructions:
1. Prepare your mashing tub and ensure it is clean and sanitized.

2. Measure out 45 gallons (170 liters) of water and pour it into the mashing tub.

3. Add the 5.5 bushels (approximately 195 kilograms) of malt to the water in the mashing tub.

4. Stir the malt and water mixture thoroughly to ensure even distribution.

5. Allow the mixture to sit for a period of time to allow the malt to soak up some of the water. This will result in approximately one-third of the liquor being absorbed by the malt.

6. After the soaking period, transfer the mixture to a boiling vessel and bring it to a boil.

7. Boil the mixture for a period of time, during which approximately one-sixth of the liquor will evaporate.

8. After boiling, strain the mixture to separate the liquid (wort) from the spent grains.

9. This liquid is the first wort. Set it aside.

10. For the second wort, add a little more liquor than you intend to make drink. The exact quantity will depend on your desired batch size.

11. Repeat steps 6-9 for the second wort, boiling the mixture and straining it to separate the liquid.

12. For the third wort, add liquor to the mashing tub according to the quantity you would like to have. This allows you to make a smaller batch if desired.

13. Repeat steps 6-9 for the third wort, boiling the mixture and straining it to separate the liquid.

14. Allow all three worts to cool to a suitable temperature for fermentation.

15. Transfer each wort to separate fermentation vessels and add yeast to start the fermentation process.

16. Follow standard brewing practices for fermentation, including monitoring temperature, allowing for proper fermentation time, and bottling or kegging the finished ale.

## Cooking time
The cooking time will vary depending on the size of the batch and the desired strength of the ale. It typically takes several hours to complete the boiling and straining process for each wort. Fermentation and aging will require additional time, usually a few weeks to a few months.
