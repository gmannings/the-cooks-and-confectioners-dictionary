# Botl'd Pudding

## Description
Botl'd Pudding is a traditional 18th-century dessert made with bread, suet, spices, dried fruit, milk, eggs, and sugar. It is a steamed pudding that is cut into slices and served.

## Ingredients:
- 200g grated bread
- 100g all-purpose flour
- 100g minced suet (or substitute with butter or vegetable shortening)
- 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
- 1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg
- 100g currants
- 100g minced dates
- 300ml warm milk
- 2 eggs
- Sugar to taste
- Butter for greasing

## Instructions:
1. In a large bowl, combine the grated bread, flour, minced suet, cinnamon, nutmeg, currants, and minced dates.
2. Gradually pour in the warm milk while stirring the mixture.
3. In a separate bowl, beat the eggs and add them to the mixture. Add sugar to taste.
4. Mix all the ingredients together until well combined and the mixture has a dough-like consistency.
5. Divide the mixture in half and shape each half into a loaf shape.
6. Place a lump of butter in the middle of one half of the mixture and cover it with the other half, forming a loaf shape.
7. Grease a heatproof bowl or pudding mold with butter.
8. Place the pudding into the greased bowl or mold and cover it with a lid or a double layer of greased parchment paper.
9. Tie the lid or parchment paper securely with kitchen twine to prevent water from entering the pudding.
10. Place the bowl or mold into a large pot and fill the pot with enough boiling water to reach halfway up the sides of the bowl or mold.
11. Cover the pot and bring the water to a boil. Reduce the heat to a simmer and steam the pudding for about 2 hours or until firm and cooked through.
12. Carefully remove the pudding from the pot and let it cool for a few minutes.
13. Unwrap the pudding and cut it in half. Serve the slices warm.
