# Butter'd Loaves

## Description
Butter'd Loaves are small bread rolls made with a rich dough that is flavored with eggs, yeast, salt, and ginger. The dough is then baked until golden brown. After baking, the loaves are brushed with a mixture of melted butter, white wine, and sugar, giving them a delicious buttery glaze.

## Ingredients:
- 12 egg yolks
- 6 egg whites
- 1/4 pint (120 ml) of yeast
- Salt
- Powdered ginger
- Flour
- 1 1/2 pounds (680 g) of butter
- 1/4 pint (120 ml) of white wine
- 1/2 pound (225 g) of sugar

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 350°F (180°C).
2. In a large bowl, beat the egg yolks and half of the egg whites together until well combined.
3. Add the yeast to the egg mixture and stir until dissolved.
4. Season the mixture with salt and powdered ginger to taste.
5. Gradually add flour to the mixture, stirring well after each addition, until a thick dough forms.
6. Transfer the dough onto a floured surface and knead for about 5 minutes, until smooth and elastic.
7. Place the dough in a warm cloth and let it rest for 15 minutes.
8. Shape the dough into small loaves and place them on a baking sheet.
9. Bake the loaves in the preheated oven for about 20-25 minutes, or until golden brown.
10. While the loaves are baking, melt the butter in a saucepan over low heat.
11. Add the white wine and sugar to the melted butter and stir until well combined.
12. Once the loaves are baked, remove them from the oven and immediately brush them with the butter, wine, and sugar mixture.
13. Allow the loaves to cool slightly before serving.
