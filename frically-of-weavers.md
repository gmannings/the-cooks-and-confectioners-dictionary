# Frically of Weavers

## Description
Frically of Weavers is a dish made with cut pieces of weaver fish cooked in a flavorful sauce with mushrooms, truffles, and herbs. The dish is thickened with a mixture of egg yolks, verjuice, and minced parsley.

## Ingredients:
- 500g weaver fish fillets
- 50g butter
- 100g mushrooms, sliced
- 50g truffles, sliced
- 1 faggot of sweet herbs (such as thyme, parsley, and bay leaves)
- Salt and pepper to taste
- 1 pinch of flour
- 200ml fish broth
- 100ml white wine
- 3-4 egg yolks
- 2 tablespoons verjuice (or substitute with lemon juice)
- 1 tablespoon minced parsley

## Instructions:
1. Gut, wash, and dry the weaver fish fillets with a kitchen towel. Cut them into bite-sized pieces.
2. In a saucepan, melt the butter over medium heat.
3. Add the weaver fish pieces, mushrooms, truffles, and the faggot of sweet herbs to the saucepan. Season with salt and pepper.
4. Toss the ingredients together over a brisk fire.
5. Sprinkle a pinch of flour over the mixture and continue tossing to coat the ingredients evenly. Be careful to prevent sticking.
6. Pour in the fish broth and white wine that you have prepared in advance. Stir well to combine.
7. Reduce the heat to low and let the mixture simmer gently.
8. In a separate bowl, beat the egg yolks with verjuice and minced parsley until well combined.
9. When enough of the fricass√©e has boiled away and the flavors have melded together, slowly pour in the egg yolk mixture while stirring constantly. This will thicken the sauce.
10. Continue stirring the sauce over low heat to ensure it does not curdle.
11. Once the sauce has thickened to your desired consistency, remove the faggot of sweet herbs and discard.
12. Dish the frically of weavers and serve it hot.
