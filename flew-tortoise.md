# Flew Tortoise

## Description
This recipe involves cooking a tortoise in a flavorful broth and then stewing the meat with butter, white wine, onions, and herbs. The dish is served on sippets, which are small pieces of toasted bread.

## Ingredients:
- 1 tortoise
- 1 bottle of red wine
- Salt
- Water
- Butter
- 2 whole onions
- Parsley
- Rosemary
- Winter savory
- White wine
- Sippets (small pieces of toasted bread)

## Instructions:
1. Cut off the head, feet, and tail of the tortoise.
2. In a large pot, combine the tortoise body, red wine, salt, and enough water to cover the tortoise.
3. Bring the mixture to a boil and then reduce the heat to a simmer. Cook the tortoise for several hours until the meat is tender.
4. Once the tortoise is cooked, carefully remove the meat from the shell. Discard the shell and set the meat aside.
5. In a separate pot or pipkin, melt the butter over medium heat.
6. Add some of the broth from cooking the tortoise to the pot, along with a splash of white wine.
7. Finely chop the onions, parsley, rosemary, and winter savory. Add them to the pot.
8. Simmer the mixture for about 30 minutes to allow the flavors to meld together.
9. Add the tortoise meat to the pot and continue to simmer for another 10-15 minutes, until the meat is heated through.
10. Serve the stewed tortoise on sippets, which are small pieces of toasted bread.
