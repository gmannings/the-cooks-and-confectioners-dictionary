# Boiled Lemon Dish

## Description
This recipe is a boiled lemon dish that was popular in the 18th century. It involves boiling a lemon until tender and then serving it on sippets (small pieces of toasted bread). The dish is then topped with a flavorful butter sauce made with orange or lemon juice, sliced ginger, large mace, and barberries. It is a unique and tangy dish that can be enjoyed as a side or a light meal.

## Ingredients:
- 1 lemon
- Sippets (small pieces of toasted bread)
- 2 tablespoons butter
- Juice of 1 orange or lemon
- 1 teaspoon sliced ginger
- 1/2 teaspoon large mace

## Instructions:
1. Fill a pot with water and bring it to a boil.
2. While the water is heating, wash the lemon thoroughly.
3. Once the water is boiling, carefully place the whole lemon into the pot.
4. Boil the lemon for about 30 minutes or until it becomes tender. You can check the tenderness by inserting a fork into the lemon. It should go in easily.
5. While the lemon is boiling, prepare the sippets by toasting small pieces of bread until they are crispy. Set them aside.
6. In a separate saucepan, melt the butter over low heat.
7. Once the butter has melted, add the juice of the orange or lemon to the saucepan.
8. Stir in the sliced ginger, large mace, and barberries (if using).
9. Cook the butter sauce over low heat for about 5 minutes, allowing the flavors to meld together.
10. Remove the boiled lemon from the pot and let it cool slightly.
11. Cut the lemon into thin slices.
12. Arrange the sippets on a serving dish.
13. Place the lemon slices on top of the sippets.
14. Pour the butter sauce over the lemon and sippets, ensuring that they are well coated.
