# Pullets a la Braife

## Description
Pullets a la Braife is a classic French dish that involves braising trussed pullets (young chickens) with a variety of flavorful ingredients. The pullets are first larded with bacon, then cooked in a stewpan with layers of bacon, beef, veal, vegetables, and seasonings. The dish is slow-cooked between two gentle fires for several hours, resulting in tender and flavorful meat. It is served with a ragout made from various ingredients such as livers, sweetbreads, mushrooms, and artichoke bottoms.

## Options and commentary
- Instead of trussing the pullets, you can use bone-in chicken pieces such as thighs and drumsticks.
- If you prefer a lighter version, you can use skinless chicken pieces.
- Feel free to adjust the seasonings and spices according to your taste preferences.
- The ragout can be customized with your favorite ingredients such as bacon, vegetables, or herbs.

## Ingredients:
- 2 pullets (or bone-in chicken pieces)
- 8-10 slices of bacon
- 200g beef, sliced
- 200g veal, sliced
- Salt and pepper to taste
- 1 tsp mixed spices (such as cinnamon, cloves, and nutmeg)
- 2 sprigs of fresh herbs (such as thyme and rosemary)
- 1 onion, sliced
- 1 lemon, sliced
- 2 parsnips, sliced
- 2 carrots, sliced
- 500ml chicken or vegetable broth
- 200g chicken livers, diced
- 200g veal sweetbreads, diced
- 100g mushrooms, sliced
- 100g asparagus tops
- 100g artichoke bottoms
- 2 tbsp bacon fat
- 250ml good quality gravy
- 1 tbsp veal or ham stock
- Salt and pepper to taste

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 160°C (320°F).

2. Truss the pullets (or prepare the chicken pieces) by tying the legs together and tucking the wings under the body. 

3. Lard the pullets by inserting large lardons of bacon into the meat, evenly distributed.

4. In a large stewpan, arrange a layer of bacon slices on the bottom. 

5. Place the slices of beef and veal on top of the bacon.

6. Season the meat with salt, pepper, mixed spices, and fresh herbs.

7. Add the sliced onions, lemon, parsnips, and carrots to the stewpan.

8. Place the trussed pullets on top of the vegetables.

9. Sprinkle the same seasoning over the pullets.

10. Layer slices of veal, beef, and bacon on top of the pullets.

11. Cover the stewpan with a lid.

12. Place the stewpan on the stovetop and cook over low heat for 4-5 hours. Alternatively, you can transfer the stewpan to the preheated oven and cook for the same amount of time.

13. Occasionally check the stewpan to ensure it is not burning. If the liquid evaporates, add a little gravy or strong broth to prevent burning.

14. While the pullets are stewing, prepare the ragout. In a separate pan, melt the bacon fat and add the diced chicken livers, veal sweetbreads, mushrooms, asparagus tops, and artichoke bottoms.

15. Cook the ragout until the ingredients are tender and cooked through.

16. Add a little melted bacon fat and good quality gravy to the ragout. 

17. Once the ragout is cooked to your liking, remove any excess fat and thicken it with veal or ham stock.

18. When the pullets are cooked, remove them from the stewpan and let them drain.

19. Arrange the pullets on a serving dish.

20. Pour the prepared ragout over the pullets.

21. Serve the Pullets a la Braife hot.
