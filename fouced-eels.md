# Fouced Eels

## Description
Fouced Eels is a dish made with eels that have been marinated in vinegar and salt, then boiled with onions, herbs, and spices. The eels are then served with a sauce made from the cooking liquid, white wine, and saffron.

## Ingredients:
- 4 large eels
- Salt
- Wine vinegar
- 2 onions
- Fresh herbs (such as parsley, thyme, and bay leaves)
- A few blades of mace
- 1 pint (473 ml) white wine
- A pinch of saffron

## Instructions:
1. Clean the eels by removing the skin and entrails. Cut them into pieces about four inches long.
2. Sprinkle salt over the eel pieces and rub it in. Rinse the eel pieces with water to remove the excess salt.
3. In a bowl, combine the eel pieces with enough wine vinegar to cover them. Add a pinch of salt and let the eels soak in the vinegar mixture for about two hours.
4. In a large pot, bring water to a boil. Add the eel pieces, onions (peeled and quartered), fresh herbs, and blades of mace. Boil the eels for about 20 minutes or until they are cooked through.
5. Drain the eels and set them aside to cool.
6. In a separate pot, combine one pint of the cooking liquid from the eels and one pint of white wine. Bring the mixture to a boil.
7. Add the saffron to the boiling liquid and stir until it dissolves.
8. Remove the spices (onions, herbs, and mace) that were boiled with the eels and add them to the white wine mixture.
9. Place the eel pieces in a serving dish or pot and pour the sauce over them.

## Cooking time
Approximately 2 hours (including marinating time)
