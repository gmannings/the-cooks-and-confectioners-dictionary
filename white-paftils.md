# White Paftils

## Description
White paftils are a type of confectionery that were popular in the 18th century. They are made from a mixture of gum-dragant, sugar, lemon juice, and lemon zest. The mixture is beaten together to form a pliable paste, which is then shaped into round or long figures and dried.

## Ingredients:
- 1 ounce gum-dragant
- 4 pounds sugar
- Juice of 3-4 lemons
- Zest of 3-4 lemons
- Handful of double-refined sugar (finely sifted)

## Instructions:
1. Dissolve the gum-dragant in water in an earthen pan. Use approximately 1 ounce of gum-dragant for every 4 pounds of sugar.
2. Add the juice of 3-4 lemons and the lemon zest or chips to the pan.
3. Stir the mixture with a spoon for 2-3 days until the gum is dissolved.
4. Strain the mixture through a linen cloth to remove any solids.
5. Pour the strained mixture into a mortar.
6. Add a handful of double-refined sugar to the mortar. Ensure that the sugar is finely sifted.
7. Beat the mixture well with a pestle until the sugar is well incorporated and the paste is very white and pliable.
8. Add another handful of double-refined sugar to the mortar and continue to beat and temper the mixture until it forms a smooth paste.
9. Shape the paste into round or long figures of any shape you prefer. You can also make impressions on the paste using seals or cyphers.
10. Place the shaped paste on a drying rack or tray and allow them to dry in a warm, dry place such as a stove or low-temperature oven.

## Cooking time
Approximately 2-3 days for the gum to dissolve and several hours for the paftils to dry.
