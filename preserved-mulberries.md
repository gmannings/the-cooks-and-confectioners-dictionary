# Preserved Mulberries

## Description
This recipe is for preserving mulberries in a sweet syrup, which helps to extend their shelf life and enhance their flavor.

## Ingredients:
- 500 grams mulberries
- 500 grams sugar
- Juice of mulberries (approximately 100 ml)

## Instructions:
1. In a large bowl, combine the mulberries, sugar, and juice of mulberries. Stir them together until the sugar is dissolved.
2. Transfer the mixture to a saucepan and bring it to a boil over medium heat.
3. Once the mixture is boiling, reduce the heat to low and simmer for about 10 minutes, or until the mulberries are soft and the syrup has thickened slightly.
4. Using a slotted spoon, remove the mulberries from the syrup and set them aside.
5. Continue to boil the syrup for another 5 minutes to thicken it further.
6. Remove the syrup from the heat and let it cool slightly.
7. Place the mulberries in a sterilized jar or pot.
8. Pour the cooled syrup over the mulberries, making sure they are completely covered.
9. Seal the jar or pot tightly and store it in a cool, dark place.
10. The preserved mulberries can be enjoyed immediately, but they will taste even better after a few days of maturing.
