# Braised Pheasant

## Description
Braised pheasant is a classic dish where the pheasant is first parboiled, then larded with bacon and beef, and finally slow-cooked in a flavorful broth. It is served with a rich ragout made with veal sweetbreads, mushrooms, and other vegetables.

## Ingredients:
- 1 pheasant
- 200g bacon, cut into lardons
- 200g beef, thinly sliced
- Salt and pepper to taste
- Spices (such as cloves, nutmeg, and cinnamon) to taste
- Fresh herbs (such as thyme and rosemary) to taste
- 1 onion, sliced
- 2 parsnips, sliced
- 2 carrots, sliced
- 200g veal sweetbreads, cooked and diced
- 100g mushrooms, sliced
- 50g truffles, sliced
- 100g asparagus tops
- 100g artichoke bottoms
- 2 tablespoons bacon fat
- 500ml beef or chicken broth
- 2 tablespoons veal or ham stock
- 2 tablespoons flour

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 160Â°C.
2. Pick and draw the pheasant, removing any feathers and innards. Cut off the legs and truss the ends of the thighs into the body.
3. Parboil the pheasant by placing it in a pot of boiling water for 5 minutes. Remove from the water and set aside.
4. Lard the pheasant by inserting the bacon lardons into the meat. Season the pheasant with salt, pepper, and spices.
5. In a large stew-pan, layer the bacon slices and beef slices. Season each layer with salt, pepper, spices, fresh herbs, sliced onions, parsnips, and carrots.
6. Place the larded pheasant on top of the layers in the stew-pan. Repeat the seasoning layers on top of the pheasant.
7. Cover the stew-pan and place it on the stovetop over medium heat. Cook for 5 minutes to allow the flavors to meld.
8. Transfer the stew-pan to the preheated oven and cook for 2-3 hours, or until the pheasant is tender and cooked through.
9. While the pheasant is stewing, prepare the ragout. In a separate pan, heat the bacon fat over medium heat.
10. Add the veal sweetbreads, mushrooms, truffles, asparagus tops, and artichoke bottoms to the pan. Cook until the vegetables are tender.
11. Pour in the beef or chicken broth and simmer over a gentle fire for 10 minutes.
12. Remove any excess fat from the ragout and thicken it by adding the veal or ham stock and flour. Stir well to combine.
13. Once the pheasant is cooked, remove it from the stew-pan and let it drain.
14. Place the pheasant on a serving dish and pour the ragout over it.
15. Serve the braised pheasant hot.
