# Rabbet Pie

## Description
Rabbet Pie is a traditional dish made with pieces of young rabbit, seasoned with herbs and spices, and baked in a pie crust. The rabbit is first fried in lard with flour and then combined with truffles, morels, and pounded lard. The pie is then baked in the oven and served with a sauce made from the frying juices and a squeeze of Seville orange juice.

## Ingredients:
- 2 young rabbits, cut into pieces
- Lard, for frying
- 2 tablespoons flour
- Salt, to taste
- Pepper, to taste
- Nutmeg, to taste
- Fresh herbs (such as thyme, rosemary, and parsley), chopped
- 4 chibbols (spring onions), chopped
- 1 cup broth (chicken or vegetable)
- 4 truffles, sliced
- 8 morels, sliced
- 4 tablespoons pounded lard
- Pie crust (store-bought or homemade)
- Juice of 1 Seville orange

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F).
2. In a large frying pan, heat enough lard to cover the bottom of the pan.
3. Add the rabbit pieces to the pan and fry them until browned on all sides.
4. Sprinkle the flour over the rabbit pieces and stir to coat them evenly.
5. Season the rabbit with salt, pepper, nutmeg, and chopped fresh herbs.
6. Add the chopped chibbols to the pan and cook for a few minutes until softened.
7. Pour in the broth and stir to combine. Cook for another few minutes until the mixture thickens slightly.
8. Remove the pan from the heat and let the rabbit mixture cool completely.
9. Once cooled, transfer the rabbit mixture to a pie dish.
10. Arrange the sliced truffles and morels on top of the rabbit mixture.
11. Dot the pounded lard over the top of the pie filling.
12. Roll out the pie crust and place it over the pie dish, sealing the edges.
13. Cut a few slits in the top crust to allow steam to escape during baking.
14. Place the pie in the preheated oven and bake for 1 hour and 30 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown and the filling is cooked through.
15. While the pie is baking, prepare the sauce. In a small saucepan, heat the frying juices from the rabbit until warmed through.
16. Just before serving, squeeze the juice of a Seville orange into the sauce and stir to combine.
17. Remove the pie from the oven and let it cool for a few minutes.
18. Serve the Rabbet Pie with the warm sauce on the side.
