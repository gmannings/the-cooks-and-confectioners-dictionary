## Description

## Ingredients:
- 100g almonds
- 250ml milk
- 4 eggs
- Pinch of salt
- Pinch of nutmeg
- Butter, for greasing

## Instructions:
1. Scald the almonds by placing them in boiling water for a few minutes. Drain and rinse with cold water.
2. Blanch the almonds by removing their skins. You can do this by gently squeezing each almond between your fingers, causing the skin to slip off.
3. Pound the blanched almonds in a mortar until they form a fine paste.
4. In a separate bowl, mix the almond paste with a little milk until well combined.
5. Strain the almond mixture through a sieve to remove any lumps.
6. In another bowl, beat the eggs (both yolks and whites) until well mixed.
7. Gradually pour the milk into the beaten eggs, stirring continuously.
8. Add a pinch of salt and nutmeg to the egg and milk mixture and stir well.
9. Place a kettle or pot with water on the stove and bring it to a boil.
10. Grease a dish with butter and place it on top of the kettle, creating a double boiler.
11. Pour the almond milk mixture into the dish on top of the kettle.
12. Stir the mixture continuously until it thickens and becomes creamy. This should take about 15-20 minutes.
13. Once the almond cream reaches a creamy consistency, remove it from the heat.
14. Serve the almond cream hot or cold, without any additional sugar.
