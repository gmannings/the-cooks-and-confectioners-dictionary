# West Country Flummery

## Description
West Country Flummery is a traditional English dessert made from wheat bran. It is a jelly-like dish that is sweetened and flavored with sugar, orange flower water, and rose water. It is typically served cold and can be enjoyed with cream, milk, wine, or ale.

## Ingredients:
- 1/2 peck (approximately 5.6 kilograms) of wheat bran
- Cold water
- Sugar, to taste
- Orange flower water
- Rose water
- Cream, milk, wine, or ale (for serving)

## Instructions:
1. Place the wheat bran in a large bowl or container and cover it with cold water. Allow it to steep for three to four days, stirring occasionally.
2. After the steeping period, strain the wheat bran through a fine-mesh sieve or cheesecloth to remove any solids. You should be left with a wheat bran liquid.
3. Transfer the wheat bran liquid to a large pot and bring it to a boil over medium heat. Allow it to boil until it thickens and reaches a jelly-like consistency.
4. Sweeten the flummery with sugar to taste. Start with a small amount and adjust according to your preference.
5. Add a few drops of orange flower water and rose water to the flummery, stirring well to incorporate the flavors.
6. Remove the pot from the heat and let the flummery cool to room temperature.
7. Once cooled, transfer the flummery to individual serving dishes or a large serving bowl.
8. Refrigerate the flummery for several hours or overnight until it is fully set and chilled.
9. Serve the West Country Flummery cold with a choice of cream, milk, wine, or ale.
