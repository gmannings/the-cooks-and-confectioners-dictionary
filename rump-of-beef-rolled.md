# Rump of Beef rolled

## Description
This recipe involves removing the bones from a rump of beef and stuffing it with a flavorful mixture of bacon, fowl breast, beef suet, boiled ham, mushrooms, herbs, onions, bread, cream, and eggs. The beef is then rolled up, tied with a string, and cooked in a pot with a garnish of bacon, beef slices, herbs, and vegetables. It is slow-cooked for several hours until tender. The dish can be served with a sauce made from mushrooms, truffles, onions, parsley, bacon, gravy, and thickened with a veal and bacon stock. It can also be served with a ragout of calves sweetbreads and cockscombs or a ragout of cucumbers and succory.

## Options and commentary
- Instead of larding the beef with bacon, you can use thinly sliced bacon to wrap around the beef.
- The farce can be adjusted to personal taste by adding or omitting ingredients such as mushrooms or onions.
- The cooking time may vary depending on the size and thickness of the beef. It is important to cook it until it is tender and easily shreddable.

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 160°C.
2. Remove the bones from the rump of beef and make a slit along the length of it, spreading it open as much as possible.
3. Lard the beef by inserting the bacon slices into the meat.
4. In a food processor, combine the fowl breast, beef suet, boiled ham, mushrooms, salt, pepper, spices, herbs, small onion, breadcrumbs, cream, and raw eggs. Process until well combined and smooth.
5. Spread the farce mixture evenly over the opened beef.
6. Roll up the beef tightly and secure with kitchen twine.
7. In a large pot or Dutch oven, arrange the bacon lardons and beef slices on the bottom to create a bed for the beef.

9. Place the rolled beef on top of the bacon and beef slices.
10. Cover the beef with additional bacon, spices, herbs, and vegetables.
11. Cover the pot tightly with a lid.
12. Place the pot in the preheated oven and cook for 10-12 hours, or until the beef is tender and easily shreddable.
13. While the beef is cooking, prepare the sauce. In a saucepan, sauté the mushrooms, truffles, small onions, parsley, and bacon until cooked and fragrant.
14. Moisten the mixture with beef or veal stock and simmer until the flavors are well combined.
15. Remove any excess fat from the sauce and thicken it with a mixture of veal and bacon stock.
