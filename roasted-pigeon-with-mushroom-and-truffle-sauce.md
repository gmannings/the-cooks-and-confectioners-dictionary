# Roasted Pigeon with Mushroom and Truffle Sauce

## Description
This recipe is a modern adaptation of an 18th-century dish that features roasted pigeons served with a flavorful sauce made from mushrooms, truffles, and other ingredients. The pigeons are first roasted to perfection, then pounded in a mortar to create a rich and tender meat base for the sauce. The sauce is made by combining the pounded pigeons with anchovies, mushrooms, truffles, capers, parsley, and chives, and simmering them in veal gravy and ham. The resulting sauce is strained and served alongside the roasted pigeons for a delicious and elegant meal.

## Ingredients:
- 2 pigeons
- 2 anchovies
- 100g mushrooms, finely chopped
- 50g truffles, finely chopped
- 2 rocamboles (optional), finely chopped
- 1 tablespoon capers
- 2 tablespoons parsley, finely chopped
- 2 tablespoons chives, finely chopped
- 250ml veal gravy
- 50g ham, diced

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F).
2. Place the pigeons on a roasting rack and roast them in the preheated oven for about 30 minutes, or until cooked through and golden brown.
3. Remove the pigeons from the oven and let them cool slightly. Once cooled, remove the meat from the bones and pound it in a mortar until it becomes a smooth paste.
4. In a saucepan, combine the pounded pigeon meat, anchovies, mushrooms, truffles, rocamboles (if using), capers, parsley, chives, veal gravy, and diced ham.
5. Place the saucepan over medium heat and bring the mixture to a simmer. Let it simmer for about 15 minutes, stirring occasionally.
6. Remove the saucepan from the heat and strain the sauce through a sieve to remove any solids. Discard the solids and keep the strained sauce warm.
7. Serve the roasted pigeons with the mushroom and truffle sauce on the side.
