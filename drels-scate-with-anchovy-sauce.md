# Drels Scate with Anchovy Sauce

## Description
This recipe is for a dish called "Drels Scate" which is made with skate fish and served with a flavorful anchovy sauce. The skate fish is first boiled with a mixture of water, vinegar, salt, pepper, sweet herbs, and cloves. Once cooked, it is set aside to cool while the anchovy sauce is prepared. The sauce is made by browning sweet butter with a pinch of flour, then adding water, vinegar, salt, pepper, nutmeg, and minced anchovies. The sauce is cooked until thickened and then poured over the cooled skate fish. This dish can be served as a first course.

## Options and commentary
- Skate fish: If skate fish is not available, you can substitute it with another firm white fish such as halibut or cod.
- Sweet herbs: The specific herbs used in the original recipe are not mentioned, but you can use a combination of herbs like parsley, thyme, and bay leaves.
- Anchovies: If you don't have fresh anchovies, you can use anchovy paste or anchovy fillets packed in oil.

## Ingredients:
- 1 skate fish (or substitute with halibut or cod)
- Water
- Vinegar
- Salt

5. In a saucepan, melt the sweet butter over medium heat.
6. Add a pinch of flour to the melted butter and cook until it turns brown, stirring constantly.
