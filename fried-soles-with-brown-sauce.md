## Description
This recipe is for fried soles served with a flavorful brown sauce. The soles are first fried until golden and then served with a sauce made with butter, herbs, fish broth, capers, and brown sauce. It is a delicious and classic dish that can be served as a main course.

## Ingredients:
- 4 sole fillets
- 2 tablespoons butter
- 2 tablespoons chopped chives
- 2 tablespoons chopped parsley
- 1 cup fish broth

## Instructions:
