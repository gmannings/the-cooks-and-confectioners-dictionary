# Oxford Skates

## Description
Oxford Skates are sausages made from chopped lean pork or veal, mixed with butter or beef suet, seasoned with salt, pepper, cloves, mace, and sage. The mixture is then combined with eggs and shaped into sausages. The sausages are fried until brown and served with mustard.

## Ingredients:
- 500g lean pork or veal
- 200g butter or beef suet
- 1 tsp salt
- 1/2 tsp pepper
- 1/4 tsp cloves
- 1/4 tsp mace
- Handful of sage, finely chopped
- 10 egg yolks
- 7 egg whites
- Flour, for rolling
- Butter, for frying
- Mustard, for serving

## Instructions:
1. Chop the lean pork or veal into small pieces.
2. In a large bowl, combine the chopped meat with the butter or beef suet.
3. Season the meat with salt, pepper, cloves, mace, and chopped sage. Mix well to ensure the seasoning is evenly distributed.
4. In a separate bowl, whisk together the egg yolks and egg whites until well combined.
5. Gradually add the egg mixture to the meat mixture, stirring well to incorporate.
6. If desired, sprinkle some flour on a clean surface. Take a portion of the meat mixture and roll it out on the floured surface to form a sausage shape. Repeat with the remaining mixture.
7. Heat butter in a frying pan over medium heat until hot.
8. Carefully place the sausages in the hot butter and fry until browned on all sides.
9. Remove the sausages from the pan and drain on paper towels to remove excess grease.
10. Serve the Oxford Skates with mustard.
