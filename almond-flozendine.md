# Almond Flozendine

## Description
Almond Flozendine is a sweet pastry dish made with blanched almonds, currants, marrow, eggs, and various spices. It is traditionally encased in puff pastry and can be served as a dessert or a sweet snack.

## Options and commentary
- You can use almond flour instead of blanching and pounding whole almonds.
- If you can't find marrow, you can substitute it with unsalted butter.
- You can use any type of sweet white wine instead of Canary.
- Feel free to add other candied fruits or nuts to the filling for added flavor and texture.

## Ingredients:
- 250g almond flour
- 1 tablespoon orange flower water

4. In a separate bowl, beat the egg yolks and whites together with the sweet white wine until frothy.
5. Add the beaten eggs and wine mixture to the butter and currant mixture. Stir in the almond mixture and mix until everything is well combined.
