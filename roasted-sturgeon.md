# Roasted Sturgeon

## Description
This recipe is for roasting a fresh sturgeon. The sturgeon is seasoned with salt, pepper, and nutmeg, and then roasted on a spit with cloves and rosemary. Bay leaves or sage leaves are placed between each piece of sturgeon to add flavor. The sturgeon is basted with butter while roasting. Once cooked, it is served with a sauce made from the drippings, beaten butter, grated nutmeg, and either orange juice or vinegar.
