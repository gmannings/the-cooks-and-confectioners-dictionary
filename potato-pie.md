# Potato Pie

## Description
This recipe is for a traditional potato pie, which was a popular dish in the 18th century. The potatoes are boiled, seasoned, and then baked in a pie crust with a variety of other ingredients such as beef marrow, dates, eringo-roots, and spices. The pie is then glazed with a mixture of butter, grapes-verjuice, and sugar, and topped with a sweet icing made from sugar and rose-water.

## Options and commentary
- You can use any type of potatoes for this recipe, but waxy potatoes like Yukon Gold or red potatoes work best as they hold their shape well when boiled and baked.
- If you can't find beef marrow, you can substitute it with beef suet or omit it altogether.
- Eringo-roots are a type of wild celery, which may be difficult to find. You can substitute it with regular celery or omit it if desired.
- Grapes-verjuice is a sour juice made from unripe grapes. If you can't find it, you can substitute it with lemon juice or white wine vinegar.
- The sugar and rose-water icing is optional and can be omitted if desired.

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 180Â°C.

8. Cover the pie dish with a pastry crust and seal the edges.
9. Bake the pie in the preheated oven for about 45 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown and the filling is cooked through.
10. In a small saucepan, melt the butter. Stir in the grapes-verjuice or lemon juice and sugar until the sugar is dissolved.
11. Remove the pie from the oven and immediately brush the melted butter mixture over the top of the pie to glaze it.
