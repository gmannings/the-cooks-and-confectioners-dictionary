# Cooleberries Preservation

## Description
This recipe is for preserving gooseberries, known as "Cooleberries" in the 18th century. The gooseberries are scalded and then stored in glass bottles to keep them fresh for a longer period of time.

## Ingredients:
- Gooseberries (at full growth but not ripe)
- Glass bottles with wide mouths
- Corks

## Instructions:
1. Pick off the tops and tails of the gooseberries.
2. Ensure that the glass bottles are very dry.
3. Place the gooseberries into the glass bottles.
4. Close the bottles tightly with the corks.
5. Fill a kettle with water and place it on the stove.
6. Heat the kettle of water slowly, allowing the water to come to a gentle simmer.
7. Carefully place the glass bottles with gooseberries into the simmering water.
8. Let the bottles remain in the simmering water for a short period of time to scald the gooseberries. The exact time will depend on the size and ripeness of the gooseberries, but a few minutes should be sufficient.
9. Using tongs or a slotted spoon, carefully remove the bottles from the simmering water.
10. Allow the bottles and gooseberries to cool completely.
11. Once the bottles are cool, cork them down tightly to create a seal.
12. Optionally, seal the corks with wax or another airtight material to prevent any air from penetrating.

## Cooking time
The cooking time will vary depending on the size and ripeness of the gooseberries, but the scalding process should only take a few minutes.
