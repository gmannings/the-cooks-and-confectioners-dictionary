# Cold Boiled Beef Salad

## Description
This recipe is a simple and refreshing way to enjoy leftover cold boiled beef. The beef is thinly sliced and mixed with onions, lemon juice, and oil to create a tangy and flavorful salad. It is garnished with parsley and lemon for added freshness.

## Ingredients:
- Leftover cold boiled beef, thinly sliced
- 1 onion or shallot, thinly sliced
- Juice of 1-2 lemons

## Instructions:
1. In a mixing bowl, combine the thinly sliced beef and sliced onion or shallot.
2. Squeeze the juice of 1-2 lemons over the beef and onion mixture.
