# Baked Peacock Pie

## Description
This recipe is for a traditional 18th-century dish of baked peacock pie. The peacock is first boned, parboiled, and then larded with large lardons of bacon. It is seasoned with salt, pepper, and nutmeg. The pie is then prepared with a buttery crust and baked until golden. Once cooled, it is filled with clarified butter.

## Options and commentary
- Instead of peacock, you can use chicken or turkey as a more accessible alternative.
- If you prefer a different seasoning, you can adjust the salt, pepper, and nutmeg to your taste.
- You can add additional herbs and spices, such as thyme or rosemary, for extra flavor.
