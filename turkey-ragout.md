# Turkey Ragout

## Description
Turkey Ragout is a flavorful and hearty dish made with tender turkey meat cooked in a rich gravy with vegetables. The turkey is first blanched, larded with bacon, and seasoned with spices. It is then stewed with bacon, suet, and broth until tender. The ragout is served with a thickened gravy and garnished with fried bread and parsley.

## Options and commentary
- You can use boneless turkey breast or turkey thighs for this recipe.
- If you prefer a leaner option, you can omit the larding with bacon.
- The spices can be adjusted to your taste preferences.
- You can use store-bought broth or make your own by simmering turkey bones and vegetables.
- The garnish of fried bread and parsley adds a nice crunch and freshness to the dish.

## Ingredients:
- 1 turkey breast or 4 turkey thighs
- 200g bacon, cut into lardons
- Salt and pepper to taste
- 1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg
- 1/2 teaspoon ground cloves
- 1 onion, peeled and whole
- 2 bay leaves
- 1 sprig of thyme
- 1/2 cup strong broth or gravy
- 1/4 cup butter
- 2 tablespoons flour
- 2 onions, finely chopped
- 1 quart (1 liter) good quality gravy
- 2 carrots, parboiled and cut into walnut-sized pieces
- 2 turnips, parboiled and cut into walnut-sized pieces
- 2 onions, parboiled and cut into walnut-sized pieces
- Juice of half a lemon
- Fried bread, for garnish
- Fried parsley, for garnish

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F).
2. If using turkey thighs, remove the skin and bones. If using turkey breast, leave it intact.
3. Flatten the turkey meat by pounding it with a meat cleaver or rolling pin until it is an even thickness.
4. Blanch the turkey meat by placing it in a pot of scalding water for a few minutes. Remove and let it cool.
5. Lard the turkey by inserting the bacon lardons into the meat, spacing them evenly. Season the turkey with salt, pepper, nutmeg, and cloves.
6. Season the outside of the turkey with salt and pepper.
7. In a saucepan or braising dish, place the turkey, half a pound of bacon, and a pound of suet sliced into pieces. Add the strong broth or gravy.
8. Flour the breast of the turkey and place it face down in the pan or dish.
9. Cover the pan or dish with a lid or foil and place it in the preheated oven. Let it stew for two hours, checking occasionally to ensure it doesn't burn.
10. After the breast is well browned, turn the turkey over and add a little more broth or gravy. Continue stewing until the turkey is tender.
11. In a separate saucepan, melt the butter and add the flour and finely chopped onions. Cook until the mixture is well browned.
12. Pour in the good quality gravy and add the parboiled carrots, turnips, and onions. Cook until the vegetables are tender.
13. Remove the fat from the liquid in which the turkey was stewed. Squeeze in the lemon juice and pour the ragout into the saucepan with the gravy.
14. Boil the ragout until it thickens to a consistency slightly thicker than cream.
15. If the turkey breast has a good color, place the ragout underneath it. Garnish with fried bread and fried parsley.
