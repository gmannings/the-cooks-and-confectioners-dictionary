# Fried Tench with Mushrooms and Herbs

## Description
This recipe is a modernized version of a traditional 18th-century dish. The tench, a freshwater fish, is fried until crispy and served with a flavorful sauce made with mushrooms, herbs, and a tangy lemon-anchovy dressing. The dish is garnished with pickles for added tanginess and texture.

## Options and commentary
- Instead of whole tench, you can use tench fillets or any other firm white fish fillets.
- Feel free to adjust the amount of mushrooms, herbs, and pickles according to your taste preferences.
- Serve the fried tench with a side of steamed vegetables or a fresh salad for a complete meal.

## Ingredients:
- 4 tench fillets (or any firm white fish fillets)
- All-purpose flour, for dredging
- Salt, to taste
- 200g mushrooms, sliced
- 2 tablespoons butter
- 2 tablespoons chopped fresh herbs (such as parsley, thyme, or dill)
- 2 artichoke bottoms, sliced (optional)
- For the thickening liquor:
  - 1 cup chicken or vegetable broth
  - 1 tablespoon all-purpose flour
  - 1 anchovy fillet, minced
  - Juice of 1 lemon
- Pickles, for garnish

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 200°C (400°F).
2. Slit the tench fillets down the back, or cut them into smaller pieces if desired.
3. In a shallow dish, combine flour and salt. Dredge the tench fillets in the flour mixture, shaking off any excess.
4. Heat a large skillet over medium heat and melt the butter. Add the tench fillets and cook until golden brown and crispy on both sides, about 3-4 minutes per side. Remove the fillets from the skillet and transfer them to a baking dish. Place the dish in the preheated oven to keep the fillets warm.
5. In the same skillet, add the sliced mushrooms and cook until they release their moisture and start to brown, about 5 minutes.
6. Add the chopped fresh herbs and sliced artichoke bottoms (if using) to the skillet. Cook for an additional 2 minutes.
7. In a separate small bowl, whisk together the chicken or vegetable broth and flour until smooth.
8. Pour the thickening liquor into the skillet with the mushrooms and herbs. Add the minced anchovy fillet and lemon juice. Stir well to combine.
9. Cook the sauce over medium heat, stirring constantly, until it thickens and coats the back of a spoon, about 5 minutes.
10. Remove the tench fillets from the oven and place them on a serving platter. Pour the mushroom and herb sauce over the fillets.
11. Garnish the dish with pickles.
12. Serve the fried tench with mushrooms and herbs immediately.
