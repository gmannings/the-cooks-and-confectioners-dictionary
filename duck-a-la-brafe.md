# Duck a la Brafe

## Description
Duck a la Brafe is a classic French dish that involves slow-cooking a duck in a flavorful broth until it becomes tender and succulent. The duck is first larded with bacon, then cooked with a variety of vegetables, herbs, and spices. The resulting ragout is served over sippets (toasted bread) for a delicious and hearty meal.

## Ingredients:
- 1 duck
- Large lardons of bacon
- Bards of bacon
- Slices of beef
- 2 parsnips, sliced
- 2 carrots, sliced
- 1 onion, sliced
- Salt
- Pepper
- Cloves
- Fresh herbs (such as thyme, rosemary, and parsley)
- Slices of lemon
- Sippets (toasted bread)

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F).
2. Take the duck and lard it by inserting the large lardons of bacon into the meat.
3. In a stew-pan, arrange the bards of bacon and slices of beef on the bottom to create a bed for the duck.
4. Add the sliced parsnips, carrots, and onions on top of the bacon and beef.
5. Season the ingredients with salt, pepper, and cloves.
6. Add the fresh herbs and slices of lemon to the stew-pan.
7. Place the larded duck on top of the vegetables and cover it with the same ingredients used for the bottom layer.
8. Cover the stew-pan with a lid.
9. Place the stew-pan on the stove over medium heat and cook for about 10 minutes to allow the flavors to meld together.
10. Transfer the stew-pan to the preheated oven and cook for approximately 2 hours, or until the duck is tender and cooked through.
11. Remove the stew-pan from the oven and carefully transfer the duck to a serving dish, placing it on sippets (toasted bread).
12. Pour the ragout (the cooking liquid and vegetables) over the duck.
13. Serve the Duck a la Brafe hot and enjoy!
