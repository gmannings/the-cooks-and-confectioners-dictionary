# Roasted Venison Haunch

## Description
This recipe is for roasting a haunch of venison. The meat is first larded with bacon and seasoned with rosemary. It is then roasted with a brisk fire, basted with butter, and served with a flavorful sauce made from claret wine, spices, sugar, bread, vinegar, and butter.

## Ingredients:
- 1 haunch of venison
- Bacon, for larding
- Fresh rosemary
- Fresh butter, for basting
- 1 pint (473 ml) of claret wine
- 1 teaspoon (5 g) of ginger, beaten
- 1 teaspoon (2 g) of cinnamon
- 1 tablespoon (12 g) of sugar
- 6 whole cloves
- 1 tablespoon (8 g) of grated bread
- Salt, to taste
- Vinegar, to taste

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to a high temperature.
2. Lard the haunch of venison by inserting strips of bacon into the meat.
3. Stick fresh rosemary leaves thinly all over the surface of the venison.
4. Place the venison on a roasting rack and put it in the preheated oven.
5. Roast the venison with a brisk fire, making sure it is not too close to the heat source.
6. Baste the venison with fresh butter every 15 minutes to keep it moist.
7. While the venison is roasting, prepare the sauce. In a saucepan, combine the claret wine, beaten ginger, cinnamon, sugar, whole cloves, and grated bread.
8. Bring the sauce to a boil and let it simmer until the flavors meld together.
9. Season the sauce with salt, vinegar, and fresh butter to taste.
10. Once the venison is cooked to your desired level of doneness, remove it from the oven and let it rest for a few minutes.
11. Slice the venison and arrange it on a serving dish. Sprinkle some salt around the dish.
12. Serve the roasted venison haunch with the prepared sauce on the side.

## Cooking time
- Cooking time will vary depending on the size of the haunch and desired level of doneness. As a general guideline, roast the venison for about 15 minutes per pound (450 g) for medium-rare. Use a meat thermometer to ensure the internal temperature reaches 135°F (57°C) for medium-rare.
