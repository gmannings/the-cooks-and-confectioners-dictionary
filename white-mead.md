## Description
White Mead is a traditional alcoholic beverage made from herbs and honey. It has a light and refreshing flavor with hints of herbs and spices. This recipe requires a few days of steeping and boiling, followed by fermentation and aging.

## Ingredients:
- Handful of thyme
- Handful of rosemary
- Handful of sweet briar
- Handful of eyebright
- Handful of wood-betony
- Handful of scabious
- Handful of Roman wormwood
- Handful of agrimony
- Water
- 1 pound (454 grams) of honey
- 6 eggshells
- 6 egg whites
- 1 cinnamon stick
- 1 nutmeg, crushed
- 4 cloves
- 1 teaspoon of mace
- 3-4 egg whites
- 1 tablespoon of yeast
- 2 tablespoons of flour
- Clay
- Bay salt

## Instructions:
1. In a wooden bowl, combine the thyme, rosemary, sweet briar, eyebright, wood-betony, scabious, Roman wormwood, and agrimony. Add enough water to cover the herbs. Leave the bowl uncovered and let it steep for 24 hours.
2. After 24 hours, transfer the herb mixture to a pot and add enough water to cover the herbs again. Bring the mixture to a boil and let it simmer until the water becomes highly colored.
3. Change the water in the pot and continue boiling until the water turns green. Keep boiling until the green color remains.
4. Set the pot aside and let it sit for another 24 hours.
5. Strain the liquid from the herbs, discarding the herbs.
6. Add 1 pound of honey to every 2 quarts (1.9 liters) of the strained liquid. Stir until the honey is fully dissolved.
7. Let the mixture settle overnight.
8. The next day, add the eggshells and egg whites to the mixture. Bring it to a boil and let it simmer for a few minutes.
9. Strain the mixture to remove the eggshells and any impurities.
10. Let the liquid cool completely.
11. Transfer the liquid to a cask or fermentation vessel.
12. In a bag, combine the cinnamon stick, crushed nutmeg, cloves, and mace. Tie the bag securely and hang it in the cask.
13. Seal the cask tightly.
14. If you want the mead to be ready to drink sooner, beat together 3-4 egg whites. Add a spoonful of yeast and two spoonfuls of flour to the beaten egg whites. Pour this mixture into the cask.
15. Mix clay with bay salt to form a paste. Use this paste to seal the cask tightly.
16. Store the cask in a cool, dark place for several weeks or months to allow fermentation and aging.

## Cooking time
Approximately 2-3 days for steeping and boiling, plus fermentation and aging time.
