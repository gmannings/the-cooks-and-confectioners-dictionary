# Stewed Salmon

## Description
Stewed salmon is a classic dish where the salmon is cooked slowly in a flavorful liquid until tender and infused with the aromatic spices and herbs. The dish is then served on sippets (toasted bread) with a garnish of spices, lemon slices, and a buttery sauce.

## Ingredients:
- 1 salmon fillet (about 1 kg)
- 500 ml beer
- 500 ml white wine
- 250 ml white vinegar
- 250 ml water
- 1 tsp salt
- 1 tsp whole peppercorns
- 1 tsp sliced ginger
- 1 tsp whole cloves
- 1 sprig of fresh marjoram
- 1 sprig of fresh rosemary
- 1 sprig of winter savory
- 1 sprig of thyme
- 1 bunch of parsley
- 1 orange, cut in halves
- 50 g butter
- Sippets (toasted bread), for serving
- Lemon slices, for garnish
- Grated bread crumbs, for garnish

## Instructions:
1. In a large stew-pan, place the salmon fillet (or cut into pieces if desired).
2. Pour the beer, white wine, white vinegar, and water over the salmon, making sure it is completely covered.
3. Add the salt, whole peppercorns, sliced ginger, whole cloves, sprigs of marjoram, rosemary, winter savory, thyme, and bunch of parsley to the stew-pan.
4. Squeeze the juice of the orange halves into the stew-pan and then add the halves as well.
5. Add the butter to the stew-pan.
6. Place the stew-pan over low heat and let it simmer gently for about 30-40 minutes, or until the salmon is cooked through and tender.
7. While the salmon is cooking, prepare the sippets by toasting slices of bread until golden brown.
8. Once the salmon is cooked, carefully remove it from the stew-pan and place it on a serving dish lined with the sippets.
9. Strain the cooking liquid through a fine sieve into a separate saucepan, discarding the solids.
10. In the saucepan with the strained liquid, heat it over low heat and whisk in some butter until melted and well combined.
11. Pour the buttery sauce over the salmon on the serving dish.
12. Garnish the dish with lemon slices and sprinkle grated bread crumbs on top.
13. Serve the stewed salmon hot as a first course.
