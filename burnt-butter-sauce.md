# Burnt Butter Sauce

## Description
Burnt Butter Sauce is a rich and flavorful sauce made by browning butter and adding flour to thicken it. It can be used to enhance the flavor and texture of thin sauces.

## Ingredients:
- 100g unsalted butter
- 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour

## Instructions:
1. Place a saucepan over medium heat.
2. Add the butter to the saucepan and let it melt completely.
3. Continue cooking the butter, stirring occasionally, until it turns a deep golden brown color. Be careful not to burn it.
4. Once the butter is browned, sprinkle the flour over it while stirring continuously. This will help thicken the sauce.
5. Cook the mixture for another minute or two, stirring constantly, to cook out the raw flour taste.
6. Remove the saucepan from the heat and let the burnt butter sauce cool slightly before using it in any sauce that needs thickening.

## Cooking time
Approximately 10 minutes.
