# Candied Eringo-Roots

## Description
This recipe is for candying Eringo-roots, a type of wild celery. The roots are boiled until tender, then peeled and pithed. They are then cooked in a sugar syrup until the sugar is drawn into the roots, resulting in a sweet and candied treat.

## Ingredients:
- Eringo-roots
- Sugar
- Water

## Instructions:
1. Boil the Eringo-roots in water until they are tender.
2. Peel and pith the boiled roots.
3. In a separate pot, combine sugar and enough water to just melt it. Use an equal amount of sugar to the weight of the roots.
4. Place the peeled and pithed roots into the sugar syrup.
5. Gently boil the roots in the syrup until the sugar is drawn into the roots. This will take some time, so be patient.
6. Turn and shake the roots in the syrup to ensure even coating and coloring.
7. Once the sugar is completely absorbed and the roots are coated, remove them from the syrup.
8. Place the candied roots on a wire lattice to cool.

## Cooking time
Approximately 1-2 hours, depending on the size and tenderness of the Eringo-roots.
