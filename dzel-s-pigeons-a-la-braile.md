# Dzel's Pigeons a la Braile

## Description
Dzel's Pigeons a la Braile is a classic 18th-century dish featuring large pigeons that are truffled, larded with bacon, and stuffed with a thick farce. The pigeons are then stewed a la braise, resulting in tender and flavorful meat. They are served with a ragout of veal sweetbreads and truffles.

## Ingredients:
- 2 large pigeons
- Truffles (for trussing and stuffing)
- Bacon (for larding)
- For the farce:
  - Ground meat (such as pork or veal)
  - Bread crumbs
  - Milk
  - Eggs
  - Salt and pepper
- For the ragout:
  - Veal sweetbreads
  - Truffles
  - Veal stock
  - Butter
  - Flour
  - Salt and pepper

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F).

2. Truss the pigeons by inserting truffles into the body cavity.

3. Lard the pigeons by inserting large lardons of bacon into the breast and thighs.

4. Prepare the farce by combining ground meat, bread crumbs, milk, eggs, salt, and pepper in a bowl. Mix well until the mixture becomes thick.

5. Stuff the pigeons with the prepared farce, ensuring they are evenly filled.

6. Place the stuffed pigeons in a large stewpan.

7. Stew the pigeons a la braise by cooking them slowly over low heat for about 2 hours. Alternatively, you can cook them in a covered casserole dish in the oven for the same amount of time.

8. While the pigeons are cooking, prepare the ragout. Start by blanching the veal sweetbreads in boiling water for a few minutes, then remove and let them cool. Once cooled, remove any membranes or connective tissue and cut them into small pieces.

9. In a separate saucepan, melt butter over medium heat. Add flour and cook for a minute to make a roux.

10. Gradually whisk in veal stock to the roux, ensuring there are no lumps. Cook the sauce until it thickens.

11. Add the veal sweetbreads and truffles to the sauce. Season with salt and pepper to taste.

12. Simmer the ragout over low heat for about 20 minutes, allowing the flavors to meld together.

13. Once the pigeons are done, remove them from the stewpan and place them on a serving dish. Skim off any excess fat from the cooking liquid.

14. Pour the prepared ragout of veal sweetbreads and truffles over the pigeons.

15. Serve the Dzel's Pigeons a la Braile hot, ensuring to clear any excess fat from the dish.
