# Partridge à la Braise

## Description
Partridge à la Braise is a classic French dish that features partridges cooked in a flavorful braising liquid. The partridges are first parboiled, then larded with bacon and seasoned with a variety of herbs and spices. They are then braised in a stew-pan with layers of bacon, beef, carrots, onions, and parsley. The dish is served with a rich ragout made from cockscombs, fat livers, sweetbreads, truffles, mushrooms, artichoke bottoms, and asparagus tops. The ragout is thickened with a veal and ham sauce and poured over the partridges.

## Options and commentary
- Instead of partridges, you can use chicken or Cornish game hens as a substitute.
- If you don't have access to some of the ingredients for the ragout, you can omit them or replace them with similar ingredients.
- The dish can be served with a haché sauce or a cucumber ragout instead of the ragout mentioned in the recipe.

## Ingredients:
- 2 partridges (or chicken or Cornish game hens)

- 200g mushrooms, sliced
- 4 artichoke bottoms, blanched
- 8 asparagus tops, blanched
- 200ml veal or chicken stock
- 100g cooked cockscombs (optional)
- 100g cooked fat livers (optional)
- 100g cooked sweetbreads (optional)
- 100g cooked truffles (optional)
- 100g cooked mushrooms (optional)
- 100g cooked artichoke bottoms (optional)

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F).
2. Pull and draw the partridges, removing the innards. Truss the legs into their bodies.
3. Parboil the partridges in a pot of boiling water for 5 minutes. Remove and drain.
4. Lard the partridges by inserting the bacon lardons into the meat, evenly spaced.
5. Season the partridges with salt, pepper, mixed spices, and the chopped herbs. Set aside.
6. In a copper stew-pan with a cover, lay bacon strips over the bottom.
7. Layer the thinly sliced beef on top of the bacon.
8. Arrange the carrot and onion slices on the beef, and sprinkle with chopped parsley.
9. Season the vegetables with salt, pepper, mixed spices, and herbs.
10. Place the partridges in the stew-pan, breast side down.
11. Season the partridges on top with the same seasonings as underneath.
12. Lay slices of beef and bacon on top of the partridges.
13. Cover the stew-pan with the lid.
14. Place the stew-pan in the preheated oven and let it braise for 1 hour.
15. While the partridges are braising, prepare the ragout. In a saucepan, melt the bacon and add the cooked cockscombs, fat livers, sweetbreads, truffles, mushrooms, artichoke bottoms, and asparagus tops (leaving out the mushrooms and asparagus tops for now).
16. Moisten the ingredients with veal or chicken stock and let them simmer for 30 minutes.
17. Skim off any fat that rises to the surface.
18. Blanch the artichoke bottoms and asparagus tops in boiling water for a few minutes until tender. Drain and set aside.
19. Thicken the ragout with the veal and ham cullis, stirring until well combined.
20. Once the partridges are done braising, remove them from the stew-pan and drain any excess liquid.
21. Add the partridges to the ragout and mix gently to coat them.
22. Dish the partridges on a serving platter and pour the ragout over them.
23. Serve the Partridge à la Braise as a first course.
