# Palty of Stags-Flech

## Description
This recipe is for a savory pie made with stag meat. The meat is marinated in a mixture of white wine, verjuice, and herbs, then larded with bacon and seasoned with spices. The pie crust is made with rye flour and filled with the marinated meat. The pie is then baked until golden brown and served hot.

## Ingredients:
- 1 kg stag meat
- 500 ml white wine
- 250 ml verjuice (or substitute with apple cider vinegar)
- Salt
- 3-4 bay leaves
- A bunch of fresh herbs (such as thyme, rosemary, and parsley)
- 1 piece of green lemon (or substitute with regular lemon)
- 200 g bacon, cut into thick strips
- Pepper
- Nutmeg
- Cloves, ground
- 500 g rye flour
- 100 g butter
- Pounded lard (for greasing)
- Bay leaves (for decoration)
- Eggs (for egg wash)

## Instructions:
1. In a large bowl, combine the white wine, verjuice, salt, bay leaves, fresh herbs, and the piece of green lemon. Mix well to create the marinade.
2. Place the stag meat in the marinade, ensuring it is fully submerged. Cover the bowl and refrigerate for at least 4 hours or overnight.
3. Preheat the oven to 180°C.
4. Remove the stag meat from the marinade and pat it dry with paper towels. Lard the meat by inserting the strips of bacon into it.
5. In a small bowl, mix together salt, pepper, nutmeg, and ground cloves. Rub this mixture all over the larded stag meat.
6. In a separate bowl, combine the rye flour, salt, and butter. Mix until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Gradually add cold water, a little at a time, until the dough comes together.
7. Roll out the dough on a floured surface to fit the size of your pie dish.
8. Grease the pie dish with pounded lard. Place a layer of thin bacon slices on the bottom of the dish, followed by a few bay leaves. Place the seasoned stag meat on top.
9. Brush the edges of the pie crust with the whites of eggs. Place the rolled-out dough on top of the pie dish, pressing the edges to seal.
10. Brush the entire surface of the pie with the remaining egg whites.
11. Bake the pie in the preheated oven for 3-4 hours, or until the crust is golden brown and the meat is cooked through.
12. Remove the pie from the oven and make a hole in the middle. Allow the pie to cool slightly before serving.
13. Serve the pie on a pie plate, either with or without the lid.
