# Farced and Fried Rumps of Mutton

## Description
This recipe involves wrapping rumps of mutton in a forcemeat made from veal, bacon, suet, and other seasonings, and then frying them until they are golden brown. The result is a flavorful and tender dish.

## Ingredients:
- 4 rumps of mutton
- 4 slices of bacon
- 1 pound (450g) leg of veal
- 1/2 pound (225g) fat bacon
- 1/2 pound (225g) suet
- 1 French roll
- Milk or broth
- 4 eggs
- Salt and pepper
- Nutmeg
- Parsley
- Onion
- Flour
- Hogs lard (or vegetable oil for frying)

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F).
2. In a stewpan, lay the slices of bacon on the bottom to cover it.
3. Place the stewpan on the stove and cook the bacon until it is slightly crispy. This can be done either by braising it on low heat or by baking it in the preheated oven for about 15 minutes.
4. In a pot, boil the leg of veal, fat bacon, and suet together for 30 minutes.
5. Remove the boiled ingredients from the pot and let them cool slightly. Then, place them in cold water for a short time to prevent the fat bacon from becoming oily when minced.
6. Mince each ingredient separately until they are finely chopped.
7. Combine all the minced ingredients together and pound them well in a marble mortar.
8. Soak the crumb of the French roll in milk or broth until it becomes soft. Squeeze out any excess liquid.
9. Add the soaked roll, raw eggs, salt, pepper, nutmeg, parsley, and minced onion to the pounded mixture. Mix well until everything is evenly combined.
10. Take each rump of mutton and wrap it in the forcemeat mixture, ensuring it is fully covered.
11. Dip the wrapped rumps in beaten eggs, then coat them with flour.
12. Heat the hogs lard (or vegetable oil) in a frying pan over medium-high heat.
13. Fry the wrapped rumps in the hot lard until they are golden brown on all sides. This should take about 5-7 minutes per side.
14. Once cooked, remove the rumps from the pan and place them on a paper towel-lined plate to drain any excess oil.
15. Transfer the fried rumps to a serving dish and serve them hot.
