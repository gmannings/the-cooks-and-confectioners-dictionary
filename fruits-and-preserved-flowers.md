# Fruits and Preserved Flowers

## Description
This dish is a decorative centerpiece made with almond paste, marmalade, and preserved fruits and flowers. It is a visually stunning dessert that can be enjoyed during the winter months.

## Options and commentary
- You can use store-bought almond paste or make your own by grinding blanched almonds with sugar and a little water until it forms a smooth paste.
- The marmalade can be made with a combination of fruits such as oranges, lemons, and berries. You can also use store-bought marmalade if desired.
- For the preserved fruits, you can use a variety of options such as apples, apricots, currants, gooseberries, peaches, pears, and plums. Choose fruits that are in season or use preserved fruits from jars.
- The branches of candied flowers can be found at specialty baking stores or online. If you can't find them, you can use edible flowers or other decorative elements.
- Instead of using colored paste, parchment, or horn for the leaves, you can use edible leaves made from sugar or chocolate.

## Ingredients:

- White, red, green, blue, and white marmalade
- Branches of candied flowers or edible flowers
- Preserved fruits such as apples, apricots, currants, gooseberries, peaches, pears, and plums

## Instructions:
1. Take a large dish and cover it with another dish of the same size to create a dome shape.
2. Roll out the almond paste into a thin sheet and use it to cover the uppermost dish completely. Smooth it out to create a flat surface.
3. Inlay the almond paste with white, red, green, blue, and white marmalade in the shapes of banks and flowers. You can create patterns or designs of your choice.
4. Take the branches of candied flowers or edible flowers and stick them upright into the almond paste in a beautiful arrangement.
5. Create small bushes by shaping almond paste into small mounds. Place these mounds on the almond paste base and secure them in place.
6. Attach preserved fruits such as apples, apricots, currants, gooseberries, peaches, pears, and plums onto the almond paste bushes. Arrange them in an aesthetically pleasing manner.
7. If desired, create leaves using colored paste, parchment, or horn. Alternatively, you can use edible leaves made from sugar or chocolate.
