# Fricassée of Calf's Chaldron

## Description
Fricassée of Calf's Chaldron is a dish made from parboiled calf's chaldron (a type of offal) that is cut into small pieces and seasoned with various spices. It is then fried with broth and butter, and served with a flavorful sauce made from mutton gravy, citrus juice, egg yolks, and nutmeg.

## Ingredients:
- 1 calf's chaldron, parboiled and cooled
- Salt
- Pepper
- Nutmeg
- Cloves
- Mace
- 1 onion, finely chopped
- Tarragon, finely chopped
- Parsley, finely chopped
- Butter
- Strong broth
- Mutton gravy
- Juice of 1 orange
- Juice of 1 lemon
- 2 egg yolks
- Grated nutmeg

## Instructions:
1. Cut the parboiled calf's chaldron into small pieces, approximately the size of walnuts.
2. Season the chaldron pieces with salt, pepper, nutmeg, cloves, mace, chopped onion, tarragon, and parsley. Mix well to ensure even seasoning.
3. In a frying pan, melt a generous amount of butter over medium heat.
4. Add the seasoned chaldron pieces to the frying pan and fry them until they are browned and cooked through. Use a ladleful of strong broth to prevent the chaldron from sticking to the pan.
5. In a separate saucepan, prepare the sauce by combining mutton gravy, the juice of orange and lemon, egg yolks, and grated nutmeg. Whisk the mixture together until well combined.
6. Pour the sauce into the frying pan with the cooked chaldron pieces. Toss the chaldron in the sauce for a few minutes to coat them evenly.
7. Remove the fricassée of calf's chaldron from the heat and transfer it to a serving dish.
8. Serve the fricassée of calf's chaldron hot.
