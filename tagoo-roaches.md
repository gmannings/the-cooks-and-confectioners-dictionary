# Tagoo Roaches

## Description
Tagoo Roaches is a dish made with broiled roaches (a type of fish) served with a flavorful sauce made from their livers. The fish is seasoned with salt, white pepper, and citrus juice, and the sauce is strained and poured over the fish before serving.

## Ingredients:
- Roaches (a type of fish)
- Butter
- Fish broth
- Salt
- White pepper
- Orange or lemon juice
- Shalot or clove of garlic

## Instructions:
1. Prepare the roaches by scaling, washing, and drawing them.
2. Preheat a grill or a broiler.
3. Place the roaches on a greased grill or broiler pan and cook them until they are fully cooked and slightly charred. This should take about 5-7 minutes per side, depending on the thickness of the fish.
4. While the roaches are cooking, melt a little butter in a small frying pan.
5. Add the livers of the roaches to the frying pan and cook them until they are browned and cooked through.
6. Remove the livers from the pan and transfer them to a mortar.
7. Pound the livers in the mortar until they are well mashed.
8. Place a strainer over a bowl and strain the mashed livers through the strainer, pressing down with a spoon to extract as much liquid as possible.
9. Discard any solids left in the strainer.
10. Add some good fish broth to the strained liver liquid and mix well.
11. Season the sauce with salt, white pepper, and orange or lemon juice to taste.
12. Rub a dish with a shalot or clove of garlic to infuse it with flavor.
13. Place the cooked roaches on the dish.
14. Pour the prepared sauce over the roaches.
15. Serve the Tagoo Roaches immediately.
