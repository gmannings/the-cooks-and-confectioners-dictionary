# Smooth Skin Oil

## Description
This recipe is a method for creating a homemade oil that can be used to smooth the skin. The oil is made by mixing sugar with capon's grease and allowing it to sit until it turns into a clear oil. The resulting oil can then be applied to the skin.

## Ingredients:
- 1 cup sugar
- 1 cup capon's grease (or substitute with chicken fat or vegetable shortening)

## Instructions:
1. In a mixing bowl, combine the sugar and capon's grease.
2. Stir the mixture until well combined.
3. Transfer the mixture to a clean, airtight container.
4. Close the container tightly and let it sit for several days, until the mixture has turned into a clear oil.
5. Once the mixture has turned into oil, it is ready to use.

## Options and commentary
- Capon's grease can be difficult to find, so you can substitute it with chicken fat or vegetable shortening.
- The amount of sugar and capon's grease can be adjusted depending on how much oil you want to make.
