# Hally Pudding

## Description
Hally Pudding is a creamy and sweet dessert made with cream, milk, sugar, and flour. It has a thick and smooth texture and can be enjoyed on its own or served with wine or cream.

## Ingredients:
- 3 pints (1.4 liters) of cream
- 1 1/2 pints (700 ml) of milk
- Salt, to taste
- 1 1/2 pounds (680 grams) of granulated sugar
- Flour, enough to thicken the mixture
- Fresh butter, for topping
- Additional sugar, for sprinkling

## Instructions:
1. In a large saucepan, combine the cream, milk, salt, and sugar. 
2. Place the saucepan over medium heat and bring the mixture to a boil, stirring occasionally to dissolve the sugar.
3. Gradually sprinkle in enough flour while continuously stirring the mixture. Keep stirring until the mixture thickens and reaches the desired consistency.
4. Once the pudding is thick enough and has boiled for a sufficient time, remove it from the heat.
5. Pour the pudding into a serving dish or individual bowls.
6. While the pudding is still hot, dot the top with fresh butter.
7. Sprinkle sugar over the top of the pudding.
8. Allow the pudding to cool slightly before serving.

## Options and commentary

- Adjust the amount of sugar according to your taste preference.
- The amount of flour needed may vary depending on the desired thickness of the pudding. Add it gradually until the desired consistency is achieved.
