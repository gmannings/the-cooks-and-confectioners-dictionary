# Forced Artichokes

## Description
Forced artichokes are a delicious and elegant dish made with boiled artichokes that are stuffed with a flavorful mixture of breadcrumbs, butter, marrow, suet, salt, and pepper. The stuffed artichokes are then baked and served with a rich gravy sauce made with butter, lemon, and gravy.

## Ingredients:
- 4 artichokes
- 100g breadcrumbs
- 50g butter, melted
- 50g marrow, finely chopped (or substitute with beef or vegetable marrow)
- 25g suet, finely chopped
- Salt, to taste
- Pepper, to taste
- 200ml gravy
- 50g butter
- Juice of 1 lemon

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 180Â°C.
2. Prepare the artichokes by removing the tough outer leaves and trimming the stems. Cut off the top third of each artichoke and use a spoon to remove the choke (the fuzzy part in the center).
3. In a bowl, mix together the breadcrumbs, melted butter, chopped marrow, chopped suet, salt, and pepper.
4. Stuff each artichoke with the breadcrumb mixture, pressing it firmly into the center and between the leaves.
5. Place the stuffed artichokes in a baking dish and sprinkle with additional breadcrumbs.
6. Bake the artichokes in the preheated oven for about 30-40 minutes, or until they are tender and the breadcrumbs are golden brown.
7. While the artichokes are baking, prepare the sauce. In a saucepan, melt the butter and add the gravy and lemon juice. Cook over low heat until heated through.
8. Once the artichokes are cooked, remove them from the oven and serve them hot, garnished with the sauce.

## Cooking time
Approximately 30-40 minutes.
