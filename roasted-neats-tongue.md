# Roasted Neats Tongue

## Description
Roasted Neats Tongue is a dish made from a tender boiled beef tongue that is stuffed with a flavorful mixture of minced meat, beef suet, apples, and hard-boiled eggs. The tongue is then roasted until golden brown and served with a tangy orange and nutmeg sauce. This dish is a delicious and hearty option for a special occasion or a Sunday roast.

## Ingredients:
- 1 beef tongue
- 100g beef suet, minced
- 2 apples, peeled and finely chopped
- 2 hard-boiled eggs, yolks only, finely chopped
- Salt, to taste
- 1 tsp ginger, grated
- 1 tsp thyme, finely chopped
- 1 tsp savory, finely chopped
- 50g veal or mutton caul fat (or substitute with bacon)
- 2 tbsp butter
- Juice of 2 oranges
- 1/2 tsp grated nutmeg
- Barberries and lemon slices, for garnish

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F).
2. In a large pot, bring water to a boil. Add the beef tongue and cook until tender, about 2-3 hours.
3. Remove the tongue from the pot and let it cool. Once cooled, peel off the skin.
4. Cut a hole in the root-end of the tongue and carefully remove some of the meat from the center, creating a cavity.
5. In a bowl, combine the minced beef suet, chopped apples, and chopped hard-boiled egg yolks. Season with salt, grated ginger, chopped thyme, and chopped savory. Mix well to combine.
6. Stuff the cavity of the tongue with the mixture, packing it tightly.
7. Cover the end of the tongue with a piece of veal or mutton caul fat. If you don't have caul fat, you can use bacon to wrap the end of the tongue.
8. Place the stuffed tongue on a roasting rack and lard the surface with small strips of bacon, if desired.
9. Roast the tongue in the preheated oven for about 1 hour, or until the surface is golden brown and crispy.
10. While the tongue is roasting, prepare the sauce. In a small saucepan, melt the butter over medium heat. Add the orange juice and grated nutmeg. Cook for a few minutes until the sauce thickens slightly.
11. Once the tongue is cooked, remove it from the oven and let it rest for a few minutes.
12. Slice the roasted tongue and serve it with the orange and nutmeg sauce. Garnish with barberries and lemon slices.
