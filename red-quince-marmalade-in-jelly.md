# Red Quince Marmalade in Jelly

## Description
This recipe is for making a delicious red quince marmalade in jelly. Quinces are peeled, cored, and scalded to extract their juice. The juice is then strained and combined with more scalded quinces and sugar. The mixture is cooked until it turns a bright red color and then transferred into pots or glasses for storage.

## Ingredients:
- 1 kg quinces
- 1 kg sugar

## Instructions:
1. Peel and core the quinces.
2. Place the quinces in a large pot and cover with boiling water. Let them sit for a few minutes to scald.
3. Remove the quinces from the pot and allow them to cool slightly.
4. Once the quinces are cool enough to handle, squeeze them through a coarse cloth to extract the juice.
5. Strain the juice through a jelly bag to remove any solids.
6. Measure the quince juice. You will need 1 liter (or 1 quart) of juice for this recipe.
7. In a large pot, combine the quince juice, scalded quinces, and sugar.
8. Place the pot on a medium-high heat and bring the mixture to a boil.
9. Once the mixture starts boiling, reduce the heat to low and simmer gently.
10. Keep an eye on the mixture and stir occasionally to prevent sticking or burning.
11. As the mixture cooks, it will start to turn red. When you see it reaching a bright red color, it is almost done.
12. Prepare a pie plate by tying it up in a cloth.
13. Once the marmalade has reached a bright red color, remove it from the heat.
14. Carefully pour the hot marmalade into the prepared pie plate, covering it completely.
15. Allow the marmalade to cool and set in the pie plate.
16. Once the marmalade has cooled and set, transfer it into pots or glasses for storage.

## Cooking time
Approximately 1-2 hours, depending on the heat and consistency desired.
