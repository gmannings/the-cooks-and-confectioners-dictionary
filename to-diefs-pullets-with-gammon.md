# To Diefs Pullets with Gammon

## Description
This recipe involves stuffing the breasts of pullets with a mixture of minced gammon, bacon, herbs, and seasonings. The pullets are then parboiled, barded with bacon, and roasted. A sauce is made by simmering sliced bacon in veal gravy and thickening it with a cullis of veal.

## Ingredients:
- 2 pullets
- 200g bacon
- 100g lean gammon
- 2 tablespoons chopped parsley
- 1 tablespoon chopped basil
- 1 tablespoon chopped chives
- Salt and pepper to taste
- 500ml veal gravy
- 2 tablespoons cullis of veal

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 180°C.
2. Loosen the skin on the breasts of the pullets by gently separating it from the flesh.
3. In a bowl, mix together the scraped bacon, minced gammon, chopped parsley, basil, chives, salt, and pepper.
4. Stuff the bacon mixture in between the skin and flesh of the pullets, ensuring it is evenly distributed.
5. Truss the pinions (wingtips) through the skin of the necks to secure the stuffing.
6. Parboil the pullets by placing them in a pot of boiling water for 5 minutes.
7. Remove the pullets from the water and pat them dry.
8. Bard the pullets by placing slices of bacon over the breasts, covering them completely.
9. Secure the bacon in place by placing a piece of parchment paper over the barded pullets and tying them with kitchen twine.
10. Place the barded pullets on a roasting rack and roast in the preheated oven for approximately 1 hour, or until the internal temperature reaches 75°C.
11. While the pullets are roasting, prepare the sauce. 
12. In a stewpan, lay the sliced bacon at the bottom and cover it.
13. Set the stewpan over a gentle heat and cook until the bacon begins to stick to the bottom.
14. Add the veal gravy to moisten the bacon and let it simmer for a few minutes.
15. Once the sauce is ready, remove any excess fat and thicken it with the cullis of veal.
16. Remove the pullets from the oven and let them rest for a few minutes before serving.
17. Serve the roasted pullets with the bacon sauce on the side.

## Cooking time
Approximately 1 hour for roasting the pullets.
