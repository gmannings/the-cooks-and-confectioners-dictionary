# Baked Mussels

## Description
Baked mussels are a delicious seafood dish where mussels are parboiled, minced, seasoned, and then baked in a pastry crust. The mussels are flavored with salt, pepper, nutmeg, and the juice of a Seville orange. After baking, the dish is garnished with slices of orange and served with a butter and white wine sauce.

## Ingredients:
- 1 kg mussels
- 1 sheet of puff pastry
- 2 eggs
- Salt, to taste
- Pepper, to taste
- Nutmeg, to taste
- Juice of 2 Seville oranges
- Butter, for brushing
- White wine, for brushing
- Slices of orange, for garnish

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 180Â°C.
2. In a large pot, bring water to a boil. Add the mussels and cook for a few minutes until they open. Remove the mussels from the pot and set aside.
3. Strain the cooking liquid and reserve it for later use.
4. Clean the mussels by removing the shells and any beards. Rinse them thoroughly in the reserved cooking liquid and a little white wine.
5. Mince the mussels finely.
6. In a bowl, combine the minced mussels, yolks of eggs, salt, pepper, nutmeg, and the juice of the Seville oranges. Mix well to combine.
7. Roll out the puff pastry sheet and cut it into circles or squares, depending on your preference.
8. Place a spoonful of the minced mussel mixture onto each pastry piece.
9. Fold the pastry over the filling to create a pocket and seal the edges by pressing them together.
10. Place the filled pastries on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper.
11. Brush the tops of the pastries with melted butter and white wine.
12. Bake in the preheated oven for about 20-25 minutes, or until the pastry is golden brown and crispy.
13. While the pastries are baking, prepare the sauce by melting some butter in a saucepan and adding a splash of white wine. Cook until the sauce has thickened slightly.
14. Once the pastries are baked, remove them from the oven and brush them with the butter and white wine sauce.
15. Garnish the pastries with slices of orange.
16. Serve the baked mussels hot as an appetizer or main dish.
