# Cowslip Wine

## Description
Cowslip wine is a sweet and floral wine made from cowslip flowers. It has a delicate flavor and is best enjoyed after aging for a few years.

## Ingredients:
- 2.5 kg sugar
- Water
- 0.5 kg cowslip flowers
- 2-3 lemons
- Lemon peel
- Toast
- Yeast
- White or Riesling wine (1 pint per gallon)

## Instructions:
1. In a large pot, combine 2.5 kg of sugar with enough water to make a gallon. 
2. Bring the mixture to a boil and let it simmer for an hour, skimming off any impurities that rise to the surface.
3. While the sugar mixture is simmering, prepare the cowslip flowers by removing any stems or leaves.
4. Once the sugar mixture has simmered for an hour, add half a peck (0.5 kg) of cowslip flowers to the pot.
5. Pour the boiling hot water over the flowers and let them steep overnight.
6. The next day, squeeze the juice of 2-3 lemons into each gallon of the mixture.
7. Cut a piece of lemon peel into thin strips and add it to the mixture.
8. Work the mixture by stirring in some toast and yeast. This will help with fermentation.
9. Transfer the mixture to a cask, making sure to leave behind any sediment at the bottom of the pot.
10. Once the fermentation process is complete, pour 1 pint of white or Riesling wine into each gallon of the mixture.
11. Let the wine stand in the cask for six months.
12. If the wine is clear and free from sediment, it is ready to be bottled.
13. Transfer the wine to bottles and let it age for at least six months to a year before enjoying. It is best at three or four years old.
