# Carraway Confects

## Description
Carraway Confects are a type of sweet candy made with caraway seeds and a sugar syrup. They have a crunchy texture and a sweet, aromatic flavor.

## Ingredients:
- 500g double refined sugar
- 250ml rose water or spring water
- 225g caraway seeds

## Instructions:
1. Prepare a deep braising pan with handles and make sure it is tinned over. Place it over a chafing dish of coals to create indirect heat.
2. Add the double refined sugar and rose water (or spring water) to the pan. Stir until the sugar is moistened and allow it to come to a boil.
3. Clean and dry the caraway seeds.
4. Using a ladle, carefully drop the hot sugar syrup onto the caraway seeds, continuously moving or shaking the pan to evenly coat the seeds.
5. Between each coat of syrup, dry and rub the seeds as well as possible to prevent clumping.
6. Continue coating the seeds with syrup until they have absorbed the desired amount and have formed into small clusters.
7. Once the clusters are formed, dry them either by placing them in front of a warm fire or in a low-temperature oven until they are completely dry.

## Cooking time
Approximately 1 hour (including drying time)
