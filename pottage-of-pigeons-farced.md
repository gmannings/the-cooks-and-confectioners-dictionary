# Pottage of Pigeons Farced

## Description
This recipe is for a rich and flavorful pottage (a thick soup or stew) made with pigeons. The pigeons are stuffed with a mixture of capon brawn (meat), minced eggs, and spices, then boiled in broth. The pottage is served with a garnish of pigeon wings and livers, and the broth is flavored with the gravy from a roasted leg of mutton.

## Ingredients:
- 4 pigeons
- 200g capon brawn (alternatively, use chicken or pork brawn)
- 2 hard-boiled eggs, minced
- Salt, to taste
- Pepper, to taste
- 1/4 teaspoon ground cloves
- 1/4 teaspoon ground mace
- 1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg
- 1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon
- 1 liter good quality broth (chicken or vegetable)
- 1 sheet of lard (alternatively, use bacon or pancetta)
- 4 slices of bread
- Pigeon wings and livers, for garnish
- Gravy from a roasted leg of mutton

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F).
2. Bring a pot of fresh water to a boil. Add the pigeons and blanch them for 5 minutes. Remove the pigeons from the pot and set aside.
3. Using your fingers, carefully lift the skin on the breasts of the pigeons to create a pocket.
4. In a bowl, combine the capon brawn and minced eggs. Season with salt, pepper, cloves, mace, nutmeg, and cinnamon. Mix well.
5. Stuff each pigeon with the brawn and egg mixture, dividing it evenly among them.
6. In a large pot, bring the broth to a boil. Season with salt and pepper to taste.
7. Place the sheet of lard in the bottom of a deep oven-safe dish. Soak the slices of bread in the broth and place them on top of the lard.
8. Arrange the stuffed pigeons on top of the bread slices. Garnish with the pigeon wings and livers.
9. Pour the remaining broth over the pigeons, ensuring they are fully submerged.
10. Cover the dish with a lid or foil and place it in the preheated oven. Cook for approximately 1 hour or until the pigeons are cooked through and tender.
11. Remove the dish from the oven and carefully transfer the pigeons to a serving platter. Arrange the garnish of wings and livers around the pigeons.
12. Strain the broth from the dish, discarding any solids. Skim off any excess fat from the surface of the broth.
13. Pour the strained broth back into the dish and add the gravy from the roasted leg of mutton. Stir well to combine.
14. Serve the pottage by pouring the broth over the pigeons at the table.
