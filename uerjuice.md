# Uerjuice

## Description
Uerjuice is a tart and acidic liquid made from the juice of unripe grapes. It was commonly used in cooking and as a condiment in the 18th century.

## Options and commentary
- Uerjuice can be used as a substitute for vinegar or lemon juice in recipes.
- If unripe grapes are not available, you can use green apples or crabapples as a substitute.

## Ingredients:
- Unripe grapes (or green apples or crabapples)

## Instructions:
1. Harvest unripe grapes when the kernels turn black. Alternatively, use green apples or crabapples.
2. Lay the grapes (or apples) in a heap to sweat for a few days. This will help soften them and release their juice.
3. Pick out any stalks or rotten parts from the grapes (or apples).
4. Pound the grapes (or apples) to a mash using a mortar and pestle or a food processor.
5. Squeeze the mashed grapes (or apples) in a hair-bag or a cheesecloth to extract the juice.
6. Transfer the juice into bottles and seal them tightly for future use.
