# Covent-Garden Poffet

## Description
Covent-Garden Poffet is a creamy and spiced dessert that was popular in the 18th century. It is made with a mixture of cream, eggs, spices, and sweetened with sugar and Sack (a type of fortified wine). The final touch is the frothy top, which adds a touch of elegance to the dish.

## Ingredients:
- 1 liter of cream
- 1 nutmeg, quartered
- 7 grams of cinnamon
- 8 egg yolks
- 100 grams of sugar
- 250 ml of Sack (or substitute with a sweet white wine)

## Instructions:
1. In a large saucepan, bring the cream to a boil over medium heat.
2. Add the quartered nutmeg and cinnamon to the boiling cream. Stir continuously to infuse the flavors and prevent burning.
3. While the cream is boiling, in a separate bowl, beat the egg yolks with a little cold cream until well combined.
4. Slowly pour the egg yolk mixture into the hot cream, stirring constantly to prevent curdling.
5. Continue stirring the mixture over medium heat until it begins to boil. Once it boils, remove it from the heat.
6. Stir the mixture until it reaches room temperature.
7. Sweeten the mixture with sugar according to your taste preferences. Adjust the amount of sugar as desired.
8. In a separate small saucepan, sweeten the Sack (or substitute) with sugar to taste. Heat it until it reaches a gentle boil.
9. Pour the sweetened Sack into a large serving bowl.
10. Holding the serving bowl as high as possible, slowly pour the cream mixture into the Sack. This will create a frothy top, which is the signature of the Covent-Garden Poffet.
11. Serve the Covent-Garden Poffet chilled, allowing the frothy top to remain intact.
