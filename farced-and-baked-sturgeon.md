# Farced and Baked Sturgeon

## Description
This recipe involves cutting sturgeon into small pieces and combining it with minced fresh eel, herbs, onions, bread crumbs, and various seasonings. The mixture is then formed into balls and baked in a pie. Once cooked, the pie is glazed with butter and verjuice (sour juice from unripe grapes).

## Ingredients:
- 500g sturgeon fillets
- 200g fresh eel fillets
- 1 bunch of savory herbs (such as parsley, thyme, and tarragon)
- 1 bunch of pennyroyal (optional)
- 2 green onions
- 100g grated bread crumbs
- Salt and pepper to taste
- 1/2 teaspoon grated nutmeg
- 50g currants
- 50g gooseberries
- 2 eggs
- 4-6 whole mace blades
- 2 hard-boiled egg yolks
- 50g barberries (substitute with cranberries if unavailable)
- 50g chestnuts, peeled and halved
- 50g butter
- 50ml verjuice (substitute with lemon juice if unavailable)

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F).
2. Cut the sturgeon fillets into small pieces, approximately the size of walnuts.
3. Mince the fresh eel fillets, savory herbs, pennyroyal (if using), and green onions together.
4. In a large bowl, combine the minced mixture with the grated bread crumbs.
5. Season the mixture with salt, pepper, and grated nutmeg.
6. Add the currants, gooseberries, and beaten eggs to the mixture. Mix well until all ingredients are evenly incorporated.
7. Shape the mixture into small balls and place them in a greased pie dish.
8. Arrange the whole mace blades, hard-boiled egg yolks, barberries, and chestnut halves on top of the balls.
9. Dot the surface of the pie with small pieces of butter.
10. Cover the pie dish with a lid or aluminum foil and bake in the preheated oven for approximately 45 minutes, or until the sturgeon balls are cooked through.
11. Remove the lid or foil and continue baking for an additional 10-15 minutes, or until the top of the pie is golden brown.
12. Once the pie is cooked, remove it from the oven and brush the surface with melted butter and verjuice (or lemon juice).
13. Allow the pie to cool slightly before serving.
