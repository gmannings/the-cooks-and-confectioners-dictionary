# Marinated Pike

## Description
This recipe is for marinating and cooking a pike fish. The pike is marinated in a mixture of verjuice (a sour juice made from unripe grapes), salt, pepper, lemon juice, chives, and bay leaves. After marinating, the pike can be fried or baked and then coated with melted butter and breadcrumbs. It is served with a sauce made from clarified butter, orange juice, salt, pepper, and melted and strained anchovies. The dish is garnished with carp milts or fried pike livers and fried parsley.

## Ingredients:
- 1 pike fish
- Verjuice (substitute with white wine vinegar or lemon juice)
- Salt
- Pepper
- Juice of 1 lemon
- Chives
- Bay leaves
- Flour
- Melted butter
- Breadcrumbs
- Clarified butter
- Juice of 1 orange
- Anchovies
- Carp milts or pike livers (optional)
- Fresh parsley

## Instructions:
1. Gut and scale the pike fish.
2. In a bowl, mix together verjuice (or substitute), salt, pepper, lemon juice, chopped chives, and bay leaves to make the marinade.
3. Place the pike fish in the marinade and let it marinate for two hours.
4. After marinating, remove the pike fish from the marinade and pat it dry.
5. Dust the pike fish with flour, ensuring it is evenly coated.
6. Heat oil in a frying pan and fry the pike fish until it is golden brown on both sides. Alternatively, you can bake the pike fish in a greased baking dish or patty-pan in a preheated oven at 180Â°C for approximately 20-25 minutes or until cooked through.
7. Once cooked, remove the pike fish from the frying pan or oven and place it on a serving dish.
8. Dip the cooked pike fish in melted butter, ensuring it is fully coated.
9. In a separate bowl, mix together breadcrumbs and a pinch of salt.
10. Sprinkle the breadcrumb mixture over the butter-coated pike fish, ensuring it is evenly coated.
11. Place the pike fish back in the oven and bake it until the breadcrumbs are golden brown and crispy.
12. While the pike fish is baking, prepare the sauce. In a small saucepan, melt clarified butter over low heat.
13. Add the juice of an orange, salt, pepper, and melted and strained anchovies to the melted butter. Stir well to combine.
14. Cook the sauce over low heat until it is heated through and well blended.
15. Once the pike fish is cooked and the breadcrumbs are golden brown, remove it from the oven.
16. Pour the prepared sauce over the pike fish, ensuring it is evenly coated.
17. Optional: Garnish the dish with fried carp milts or fried pike livers and fried parsley.
18. Serve the marinated pike hot.
