# Molles of Divers Colours

## Description
This recipe is for making colorful mofs, which are a type of sweet confectionery. The mofs can be made in various colors such as white, red, blue, violet, yellow, and green. The mofs are made by mixing gum-dragant with different ingredients to achieve the desired color.

## Options and commentary
- You can choose to make mofs in a single color or create marbled mofs with multiple colors.
- The choice of color can be based on personal preference or the occasion.
- The mofs can be enjoyed as a sweet treat or used as decorative elements in desserts.

## Ingredients:
- Gum-dragant
- Lemon juice
- Double-refined sugar
- Cochineal (for red mofs)
- Indigo and Orris (for blue or violet mofs)
- Saffron or Gumbooge (for yellow mofs)
- Beet leaves (for green mofs)

## Instructions:
1. In a bowl, combine gum-dragant with fair water and lemon juice. Let it steep for a while.
2. Strain the mixture through a linen cloth to remove any impurities.
3. In a separate bowl, mix double-refined sugar that has been powdered and sifted through a fine sieve.
4. Gradually add the gum-dragant mixture to the powdered sugar, working it into a white paste.
5. Use a mortar and pestle to beat the mixture well together until it is smooth and well combined.
6. If you want to make red mofs, add prepared cochineal to the gum-water mixture before combining it with the sugar.
7. For blue or violet mofs, mix indigo and orris with the gum-water mixture before adding it to the sugar.
8. To make yellow mofs, use saffron or gumbooge in the gum-water mixture.
9. If you prefer green mofs, take the juice of beet leaves and scald it slightly over the fire before adding it to the mixture.
10. Once you have prepared the different colored mofs, you can choose to create marbled mofs by taking a small piece of each color and layering them on a sieve.
11. Use a spoon to press the different colors through the sieve, creating marbled rocks of mofs with different colors.
