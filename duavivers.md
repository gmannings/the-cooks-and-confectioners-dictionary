# Duavivers

## Description
Duavivers are a dish made with quavivers, which are likely a type of fish. They can be prepared in various ways, including frying, grilling, or incorporating them into a ragout or fricassee. They can be served with different garnishes and sauces, such as mushrooms, morils, artichoke bottoms, capers, and anchovies. Another option is to serve them with cucumbers and mushrooms, similar to how perch and soles are prepared.

## Options and commentary
- Quavivers: As the exact identity of quavivers is unclear, you can use a firm white fish such as cod, haddock, or halibut as a modern alternative.
- Mushrooms: Any type of mushrooms can be used, such as button mushrooms, cremini mushrooms, or shiitake mushrooms.
- Morils: Morils are likely morel mushrooms. If you can't find morels, you can use other types of mushrooms or omit them.
- Artichoke bottoms: Canned or jarred artichoke bottoms can be used.
- Capers: These are small pickled flower buds. They add a tangy and salty flavor to the dish.
- Anchovies: These are small, oily fish that are usually sold in cans or jars. They have a strong, savory flavor.
- Lemon juice: Freshly squeezed lemon juice adds a bright and acidic element to the dish.

## Ingredients:
- 500g firm white fish fillets (such as cod, haddock, or halibut)
- 200g mushrooms, sliced
- 200g artichoke bottoms, drained and sliced
- 2 tablespoons capers
- 4 anchovy fillets, chopped
- Juice of 1 lemon
- Salt and pepper to taste
- Olive oil for frying

## Instructions:
1. If using fresh fish fillets, rinse them under cold water and pat dry with paper towels. Cut the fillets into serving-sized pieces.
2. In a large frying pan, heat some olive oil over medium heat.
3. Season the fish fillets with salt and pepper, then carefully place them in the hot pan. Cook for about 3-4 minutes on each side, or until the fish is cooked through and golden brown. Remove the cooked fish from the pan and set aside.
4. In the same pan, add a bit more olive oil if needed, then add the sliced mushrooms. Cook until the mushrooms are tender and lightly browned.
5. Add the sliced artichoke bottoms to the pan and cook for another 2-3 minutes.
6. Stir in the capers and chopped anchovies, and cook for an additional minute to allow the flavors to meld together.
7. Squeeze the lemon juice over the mixture and season with salt and pepper to taste. Stir well.
8. Return the cooked fish fillets to the pan and gently toss them in the sauce to coat.
9. Cook for another minute or two, just until the fish is heated through.
10. Serve the duavivers with the garniture of your choice, such as steamed vegetables, roasted potatoes, or a side salad.
