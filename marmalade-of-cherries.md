# Marmalade of Cherries

## Description
This recipe is for making a delicious marmalade of cherries. The cherries are cooked with sugar until it reaches a thick consistency and then molded into various shapes. The marmalade is then dried in a stove with a good fire.

## Options and commentary
- You can use fresh or frozen cherries for this recipe.
- Adjust the amount of sugar according to your taste preference.
- You can use any desired molds to shape the marmalade.

## Ingredients:
- 500g cherries
- 300g sugar

## Instructions:
1. Place the cherries in a preserving pan.
2. Add the sugar to the cherries and mix well until the sugar is evenly distributed.
3. Heat the mixture over medium heat, stirring constantly, until the sugar has melted and the mixture has reached a feathered consistency. This means that when you lift the spoon, the mixture should fall off in thin threads that resemble feathers.
4. Reduce the heat to low and let the mixture simmer for a while, stirring occasionally, until it thickens and starts to loosen from the bottom of the pan.
5. While the mixture is simmering, prepare tin molds by greasing them lightly with oil or butter.
6. Once the mixture has thickened, remove it from the heat and carefully pour it into the prepared molds, filling them to the desired level.
7. Place the molds in a stove or oven set to a low temperature (around 100Â°C) with a good fire. This will help dry out the marmalade.
8. Leave the molds in the stove for several hours, checking occasionally, until the marmalade has dried and set.
9. Once the marmalade is completely dry, remove it from the molds and store in an airtight container.

## Cooking time
- Cooking time will vary depending on the thickness of the marmalade and the drying conditions, but it can take several hours to dry the marmalade completely.
