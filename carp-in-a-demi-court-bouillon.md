# Carp in a Demi Court-Bouillon

## Description
This recipe is for cooking carp in a demi court-bouillon, a flavorful broth made with wine, vinegar, and various spices. The carp is boiled in the broth until cooked through, and then served with a garnish of lemon slices.

## Ingredients:
- 1 carp, scaled and cut into four quarters
- 500 ml white wine
- 250 ml white vinegar
- 250 ml verjuice (or substitute with lemon juice)
- Salt, to taste
- Pepper, to taste
- 4 cloves
- 1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg
- 4 chibbols (small onions), peeled and halved
- 2 bay leaves
- 50 g butter, melted until browned
- Peel of 1 orange
- 2 tablespoons capers
- Slices of lemon, for garnish

## Instructions:
1. In a large pot, combine the white wine, white vinegar, and verjuice (or lemon juice). Add salt, pepper, cloves, nutmeg, chibbols, bay leaves, burnt butter, and orange peel. Bring the mixture to a boil.
2. Add the carp quarters to the pot, making sure they are fully submerged in the broth. Reduce the heat to a simmer.
3. Cook the carp in the broth for about 20-30 minutes, or until it is cooked through and flakes easily with a fork. Remove the carp from the broth and set aside.
4. Increase the heat and continue boiling the broth until it reduces to a small quantity, intensifying the flavors.
5. Stir in the capers into the reduced broth.
6. To serve, place the carp quarters on a serving platter and pour the reduced broth over them. Garnish with slices of lemon.

## Cooking time
Approximately 30-40 minutes
