# Fried Grailings

## Description
Fried Grailings is a dish made with small freshwater fish, such as Gudgeons, Perches, or Jacks. The fish are cleaned, coated in flour, and fried until golden and crispy. They are then served with a flavorful butter sauce and garnished with herbs. This dish is a delicious and simple way to enjoy small freshwater fish.

## Ingredients:
- Small freshwater fish (such as Gudgeons, Perches, or Jacks)
- Salt
- Water
- Flour
- Butter
- Sage
- Parsley
- 3-4 Anchovies (optional)
- Parsley leaves, strawberry leaves, or other herbs for garnish

## Instructions:
1. Start by cleaning the fish. Scrape off any scales and wash them in salted water.
2. Gut the fish and pat them dry with a paper towel.
3. Coat the fish in flour, shaking off any excess.
4. Heat a generous amount of butter in a frying pan over medium heat.
5. Fry the fish in the butter until they are brown and crispy on both sides. This should take about 2-3 minutes per side, depending on the size of the fish. You may need to fry them in batches to avoid overcrowding the pan.
6. Once the fish are cooked, transfer them to a heated dish and keep warm near the fire.
7. Pour away the butter used for frying the fish.
8. In a separate pan, melt more butter and fry the sage and parsley until they are crispy. This should take about 1-2 minutes.
9. Arrange the fried sage and parsley on top of the fish.
10. In a small saucepan, melt some butter and add the anchovies (if using). Stir until the anchovies dissolve.
11. Beat the butter with three to four spoonfuls of scalding-hot water.
12. Pour the butter sauce over the fish.
13. Garnish with parsley leaves, strawberry leaves, or other herbs.
14. Serve the fried grailings immediately.

## Cooking time
Approximately 20 minutes, depending on the size and quantity of the fish.
