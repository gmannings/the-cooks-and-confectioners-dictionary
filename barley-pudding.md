# Barley Pudding

## Description
A creamy and comforting dessert made with barley, milk, cream, sugar, and eggs. The pudding is baked twice to achieve a delicious texture.

## Ingredients:
- 250g pearl barley, well washed
- 3 liters of whole milk
- 1 liter of heavy cream
- 200g granulated sugar
- 1 grated nutmeg
- Pinch of salt
- 6 eggs, beaten
- 170g beef marrow (optional, can be substituted with butter)
- 115g grated bread (can use breadcrumbs)

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F).
2. In a large saucepan, combine the washed barley, milk, cream, sugar, grated nutmeg, and salt. Mix well.
3. Place the saucepan over medium heat and bring the mixture to a simmer. Cook for about 30 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the barley is tender and the mixture has thickened slightly.
4. Remove the saucepan from the heat and let it cool for a few minutes.
5. Transfer the barley mixture to a deep baking dish or pan.
6. Bake the pudding in the preheated oven for 30 minutes, or until the top is golden brown.
7. While the pudding is baking, prepare the second layer. In a separate bowl, combine the beaten eggs, beef marrow (or butter), and grated bread. Mix well.
8. After the initial baking time, remove the pudding from the oven and spread the egg mixture evenly over the top.
9. Return the pudding to the oven and bake for an additional 20-30 minutes, or until the top is set and golden brown.
10. Remove the pudding from the oven and let it cool for a few minutes before serving.
11. Serve the barley pudding warm or chilled, as desired.
