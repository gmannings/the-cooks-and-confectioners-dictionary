# Pickled Currants

## Description
Pickled currants are a tangy and sweet condiment that can be used in a variety of dishes. They add a burst of flavor to salads, cheese boards, and even desserts. This recipe calls for slightly underripe currants, which will hold their shape better during the pickling process.

## Ingredients:
- 500g underripe currants
- 500ml white wine vinegar
- 200g sugar

## Instructions:
1. Wash the currants and remove any stems or leaves. Pat them dry with a clean kitchen towel.
2. In a small saucepan, heat the white wine vinegar over low heat until warm. Do not let it boil.
3. Add the sugar to the warm vinegar and stir until it dissolves completely.
4. Place the currants in a sterilized jar or container.
5. Pour the warm vinegar mixture over the currants, making sure they are completely covered.
6. Seal the jar or container tightly and let it cool to room temperature.
7. Once cooled, store the pickled currants in the refrigerator for at least 24 hours before using.
8. The pickled currants can be kept in the refrigerator for up to 1 month.
