# Boiled Ducks with Claret, Oysters, and Chestnuts

## Description
This recipe is a modernized version of a traditional 18th-century French dish. The ducks are first larded and partially roasted, then boiled in a flavorful mixture of claret wine, oysters, chestnuts, onions, ginger, thyme, and mace. The dish is thickened with grated French roll crust and served on sippets (toasted bread).

## Options and commentary
- Instead of larding the ducks, you can use bacon or pancetta to add flavor and moisture.
- If you don't have claret wine, you can use any dry red wine.
- If fresh oysters are not available, you can use canned or frozen oysters.
- If chestnuts are not in season, you can use other nuts like walnuts or hazelnuts.
- Sippets can be made from any type of bread, such as baguette or sourdough.

## Ingredients:
- 2 ducks
- 200 ml claret wine
- 200 g oysters, bearded
- 200 g chestnuts, peeled and cooked
- 2 onions, minced
- 1 tsp ginger, grated
- 1 tsp thyme leaves, stripped
- 1/2 tsp mace
- 1 French roll, crust grated
- Sippets (toasted bread) for serving

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F).
2. Lard the ducks by inserting strips of bacon or pancetta into the meat.
3. Place the ducks on a roasting rack and roast in the preheated oven for about 20 minutes, or until partially cooked.
4. Remove the ducks from the oven and let them cool slightly. Cut each duck in half.
5. In a large pot or pipkin, combine the claret wine, oysters, chestnuts, minced onions, grated ginger, thyme leaves, and mace.
6. Place the pot over medium heat and bring the mixture to a simmer.
7. Add the partially roasted duck halves to the pot and simmer for about 30 minutes, or until the ducks are fully cooked and tender.
8. Remove the ducks from the pot and set them aside.
9. Gradually sprinkle the grated French roll crust into the pot, stirring continuously to thicken the sauce.
10. Return the ducks to the pot and simmer for an additional 5 minutes to allow the flavors to meld.
11. To serve, place sippets (toasted bread) in a serving dish and arrange the duck halves on top. Pour the sauce over the ducks and sippets.
