# Buttered Lobsters

## Description
Buttered lobsters are a classic seafood dish where the meat of the lobster is cooked with white wine, butter, and breadcrumbs, and then served in the lobster shells. It is a rich and flavorful dish that can be enjoyed as an appetizer or a main course.

## Ingredients:
- 2 lobsters
- 1/2 cup white wine
- Salt, to taste
- 1 blade of mace (optional)
- 4 tablespoons butter
- 1/2 cup breadcrumbs

## Instructions:
1. Fill a large pot with water and bring it to a boil. Add salt to the boiling water.
2. Carefully place the lobsters into the boiling water and cook for about 8-10 minutes, or until the shells turn bright red.
3. Remove the lobsters from the pot and let them cool slightly.
4. Once the lobsters are cool enough to handle, twist off the claws and tail from the body. Crack the claws and remove the meat. Remove the meat from the tail as well.
5. Mince the lobster meat into small pieces.
6. In a stew-pan, combine the minced lobster meat, white wine, salt, and the blade of mace (if using). Place the stew-pan over low heat and let it simmer gently for about 5 minutes.
7. Add the butter and breadcrumbs to the stew-pan and stir well to combine. Cook for an additional 2-3 minutes, until the butter has melted and the breadcrumbs have absorbed some of the liquid.
8. Meanwhile, warm the lobster shells by placing them near the fire or in a preheated oven for a few minutes.
9. Fill the warm lobster shells with the cooked lobster mixture.
10. Serve the buttered lobsters immediately.
