# Veal and Beef Pate

## Description
This recipe is for a savory veal and beef pate. The meat is minced and seasoned with a blend of spices and herbs, then bound together with eggs. The pate can be fried until golden brown or baked until cooked through.

## Options and commentary
- You can use ground veal and beef instead of mincing the meat yourself.
- Feel free to adjust the seasoning to your taste preferences.
- You can choose to fry the pate for a crispy exterior or bake it for a softer texture.
