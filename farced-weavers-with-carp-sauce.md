# Farced Weavers with Carp Sauce

## Description
This recipe is for farced (stuffed) weavers, which are small fish. The fish is stuffed with a mixture of mushrooms, herbs, butter, bread crumbs, and eggs, then cooked in a sauce made from carp, vegetables, and spices. The dish is then served with a ragout of mushrooms or truffles.

## Options and commentary
- Instead of weavers, you can use any small, white-fleshed fish such as sole or flounder.
- The ragout can be made with any type of mushrooms or truffles, depending on your preference and availability.
- Cooking time may vary depending on the size and thickness of the fish.

## Ingredients:
- 4 small white-fleshed fish (such as weavers, sole, or flounder)
- 200g mushrooms, finely chopped
- 2 tablespoons chopped chives
- 2 tablespoons chopped parsley
- Salt and pepper to taste
- 1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg
- 50g butter, softened
- 1 French roll, soaked in cream
- 2 egg yolks
- 1 carp, scaled and gutted
- 2 tablespoons butter
- 6 onions, sliced
- 1 parsnip, sliced
- 1 carrot, sliced
- 2 tablespoons flour
- 500ml fish stock or vegetable stock
- 250ml white wine
- Salt and pepper to taste
- 1/4 teaspoon ground spices (such as cinnamon, cloves, or allspice)
- 200g mushrooms, sliced
- Chopped chives and parsley for garnish

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F).
2. Gut, wash, and dry the weavers (or other small fish). Set aside.
3. Remove the bones from one of the weavers and spread the flesh on a board or dresser.
4. In a bowl, combine the chopped mushrooms, chives, parsley, salt, pepper, and nutmeg.
5. Add the softened butter, soaked French roll, and egg yolks to the bowl. Mix well.
6. Pound the mixture in a mortar until well combined.
7. Stuff the weavers with the mixture, filling them through the gills.
8. Place the stuffed weavers in a saucepan.
9. Cut the carp into pieces.
10. In a separate saucepan, melt the butter and add the sliced onions, parsnip, and carrot. Stir with a spoon and cook until they are half browned.
11. Add the flour to the saucepan and continue cooking until the vegetables are sufficiently browned.
12. Add the pieces of carp to the saucepan and cook for a few minutes, turning them over.
13. Pour in the fish stock or vegetable stock, white wine, salt, pepper, spices, sliced mushrooms, chives, parsley, and any other desired herbs.
14. Allow the mixture to stew together for about 30 minutes, or until the fish is cooked through.
15. Strain the mixture through a sieve, pressing the carp with a wooden ladle to extract all the flavors.
16. Pour some of the sauce into the saucepan with the stuffed weavers and set it to stew over low heat.
17. Cook the stuffed weavers in the sauce until they are cooked through.
18. Drain the stuffed weavers well.
19. Arrange the stuffed weavers on a serving dish and pour the mushroom or truffle ragout over them.
