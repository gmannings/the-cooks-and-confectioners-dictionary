# Aqua Uitee

## Description
Aqua Uitee is a distilled spirit made from well-brewed beer. It is a strong and flavorful drink that can be enjoyed on its own or used as a base for cocktails.

## Ingredients:
- Well-brewed beer, strongly hopped and well-fermented
- Cold water

## Instructions:
1. Take a large hogshead (a large barrel) and set up a distillation apparatus with a serpentine-worm. If you don't have a serpentine-worm, you can use an alembic.
2. Pour the well-brewed beer into the hogshead.
3. Distill the beer by heating the hogshead and collecting the vapor that comes off. The vapor will condense in the serpentine-worm or alembic and turn into liquid.
4. Collect the liquid distillate, which is called "Rectification." This liquid will contain the alcohol from the beer.
5. Let the rectified liquid stand for seven days to allow any impurities to settle.
6. After seven days, distill the rectified liquid again to further purify it. This will help remove any unpleasant flavors or impurities.
7. If desired, you can perform a third distillation using a bain-marie (a water bath) to further purify the spirit and remove any remaining impurities.
8. Once the distillation process is complete, you will have Aqua Uitee, a spirit similar to brandy. You can test its proof by throwing a small amount into a fire. If it ignites easily, it is at brandy proof.

## Options and commentary
- It is important to use well-brewed beer that is strongly hopped and well-fermented to ensure a flavorful and aromatic Aqua Uitee.
- The distillation process can be time-consuming and requires specialized equipment. If you don't have access to a hogshead, serpentine-worm, or alembic, it may be difficult to replicate this recipe exactly.
- Aqua Uitee can be enjoyed on its own or used as a base for cocktails. Experiment with different mixers and flavors to create your own unique cocktails using this spirit.

## Cooking time
The cooking time for Aqua Uitee will vary depending on the equipment used and the desired level of purification. It may take several days to complete the distillation process.
