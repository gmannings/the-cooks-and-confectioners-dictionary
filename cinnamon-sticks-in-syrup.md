# Cinnamon Sticks in Syrup

## Description
Cinnamon sticks are soaked in a syrup and then dried to create a sweet and aromatic treat.

## Ingredients:
- Cinnamon sticks
- Sugar

## Instructions:
1. Cut the cinnamon sticks into small sticks, approximately 2-3 cm long.
2. Place the cinnamon sticks in a saucepan and cover them with a thin layer of sugar.
3. Add enough water to the saucepan to create a syrup-like consistency.
4. Bring the mixture to a boil and then remove the pan from the heat.
5. Allow the cinnamon sticks to soak in the syrup for 5-6 hours.
6. Remove the cinnamon sticks from the syrup and place them on a wire grate to dry.
7. Once the sticks are partially dry, transfer them to a sieve and continue drying them thoroughly in a low-temperature oven or dehydrator.
8. Arrange the cinnamon sticks in tin molds, using small grates to separate them into three rows.
9. In the meantime, prepare a sugar syrup by boiling sugar until it reaches the hard crack stage (approximately 150°C/300°F).
10. Pour the hot sugar syrup into the molds, ensuring that some of it covers the top row of cinnamon sticks.
11. Place the molds in the oven with a covered fire and let them sit overnight.
12. The next morning, check if the cinnamon sticks have solidified. If not, leave them in the molds for a little longer.
13. Once the sticks have coagulated, turn the molds upside down and place them back in the oven with a plate underneath to catch any drips.
14. Allow the sticks to drain thoroughly.
15. Gently remove the cinnamon sticks from the molds, loosening them little by little.
16. Place the sticks on a sieve and continue drying them thoroughly in the oven or dehydrator.
