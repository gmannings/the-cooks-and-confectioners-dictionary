# Turkey Pie

## Description
This recipe is for a delicious and flavorful turkey pie, prepared in the French style. The turkey is trussed, beaten to break the bones, and then larded with thick bacon. The pie is filled with a mixture of minced turkey liver, raw bacon, herbs, onions, parsley, mushrooms, truffles, and marrow. The turkey is stuffed with some of this mixture and placed on a layer of the mixture in the pie. Thin slices of bacon are placed on top, and the pie is baked until golden. After baking, the excess fat is removed, and a ragout of mushrooms, veal sweetbreads, and cockscombs is poured into the pie. This pie can be served as a side dish.

## Options and commentary
- You can use turkey breast or a whole turkey for this recipe, depending on your preference and the number of servings you need.
- If you don't have access to truffles, you can omit them or substitute with other mushrooms.
- The ragout can be customized with your favorite ingredients such as vegetables or different types of meat.

## Ingredients:
- 1 turkey (whole or breast)
- Thick bacon, for larding
- 200g turkey liver
- 100g raw bacon
- Fresh herbs (such as thyme, rosemary, and sage), finely chopped
- 2 chibbols (spring onions), finely chopped
- Handful of parsley, finely chopped
- 100g mushrooms, finely chopped
- 50g truffles, finely chopped (optional)
- 50g marrow, finely chopped
- Salt and pepper, to taste
- Pie crust or puff pastry
- Thin slices of bacon, for topping the pie
- 200g mushrooms, for the ragout
- 100g veal sweetbreads, for the ragout
- 100g cockscombs, for the ragout

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F).
2. Truss the turkey to prepare it for larding. This involves tying the legs and wings close to the body using kitchen twine.
3. Place the turkey on a sturdy surface and gently beat the breast side with a meat mallet or rolling pin to break the bones slightly. This will help the turkey cook more evenly.
4. Using a larding needle, insert thick lardons of bacon into the turkey, spacing them evenly throughout the meat.
5. In a food processor, combine the turkey liver, raw bacon, herbs, chibbols, parsley, mushrooms, truffles (if using), and marrow. Season with salt and pepper.
6. Pulse the mixture until well combined and finely minced.
7. Stuff the body cavity of the turkey with some of the minced mixture, packing it in tightly.
8. Spread a layer of the minced mixture on the bottom of a pie dish or baking dish.
9. Place the stuffed turkey on top of the minced mixture in the dish.
10. Season the turkey with salt and pepper.
11. Lay thin slices of bacon over the top of the turkey, covering it completely.
12. Roll out the pie crust or puff pastry and cover the dish, sealing the edges.
13. Place the pie in the preheated oven and bake for approximately 2-3 hours, or until the turkey is cooked through and the pastry is golden brown.
14. Once the pie is baked, remove it from the oven and let it cool slightly.
15. Carefully remove any excess fat from the top of the pie.
16. In a separate pan, prepare the ragout by sautéing the mushrooms, veal sweetbreads, and cockscombs until cooked through.
17. Pour the ragout into the pie, filling it to the top.
18. Serve the turkey pie hot as a side dish.
