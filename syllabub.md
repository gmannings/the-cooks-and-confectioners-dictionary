# Syllabub

## Description
Syllabub is a traditional English dessert made with wine, fruit juice, sugar, and cream. It has a light and frothy texture, similar to a mousse or whipped cream.

## Options and commentary
- You can use either Sack (a type of fortified wine) or white wine for this recipe.
- If raspberries are not available, you can use any other berry juice or even citrus juice as a substitute.
- The lemon, nutmeg, and rosemary add flavor to the syllabub, but you can adjust the quantities according to your taste preferences.
- A wooden cow is a traditional tool used to squirt the cream mixture into the pot, but you can use a whisk or electric mixer instead.

## Ingredients:
- 1 pint (473 ml) of Sack or white wine
- 1 pint (473 ml) of raspberry juice (or any other fruit juice)

- 1 nutmeg, quartered
- 1 sprig of rosemary

## Instructions:
