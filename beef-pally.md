# Beef Pally

## Description
Beef Pally is a dish made with a boneless rump or sirloin of beef that is marinated in sugar and spices, then baked in a pastry crust. The bones are used to make a flavorful gravy to serve with the dish.

## Ingredients:
- 1 boneless rump or sirloin of beef (approximately 1 kg)
- 2 ounces (56 grams) of sugar
- Salt
- Pepper
- Nutmeg
- 1 pound (454 grams) of butter
- Pastry dough for a double-crust pie
- Water

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F).
2. Take the boneless rump or sirloin of beef and remove any excess fat or connective tissue.
3. Place the beef on a cutting board and use a rolling pin to pound it evenly to tenderize it.
4. Sprinkle the sugar evenly over the beef and rub it in. Let it marinate for 24 hours in the refrigerator.
5. After 24 hours, wipe off any excess sugar or rinse it off with a little claret (red wine).
6. Season the beef generously with salt, pepper, and nutmeg.
7. Roll out the pastry dough and line a baking dish or pie dish with one of the pastry crusts.
8. Place the seasoned beef in the pastry-lined dish.
9. Cut the butter into slices and lay them evenly over the beef.
10. Cover the beef with the second pastry crust and seal the edges.
11. Make a few slits on the top crust to allow steam to escape during baking.
12. Place the dish in the preheated oven and bake for approximately 1 hour and 30 minutes, or until the pastry is golden brown and the beef is cooked to your desired level of doneness.
13. While the beef is baking, place the beef bones in a pot and add enough water to cover them.
14. Bake the bones in the oven to make a flavorful gravy.
15. Once the pastry is baked and the beef is cooked, remove the dish from the oven and let it rest for a few minutes.
16. If the pastry needs additional liquid, pour some of the gravy made from the beef bones into the dish.
17. Serve the Beef Pally hot, with the gravy on the side.
