# Pot Beef

## Description
Pot Beef is a traditional dish where beef is cured and then slow-cooked in its own fat. The beef becomes tender and flavorful, making it perfect for sandwiches or as a main dish.

## Options and commentary
- You can use any veiny piece of beef, such as chuck roast or brisket.
- Instead of beating the beef with a rolling pin, you can use a meat tenderizer to break down the fibers.
- Salt-petre and Salt-prunella are outdated ingredients and can be omitted.
- Season the beef with your preferred spices and herbs, in addition to pepper and salt.
- Instead of using beef suet, you can use bacon or pancetta slices for added flavor.
- If you prefer a leaner dish, you can use less butter or substitute it with olive oil.
- You can serve the pot beef hot or cold, depending on your preference.

## Ingredients:
- 1 veiny piece of beef (e.g., chuck roast or brisket)
- Salt and pepper, to taste
- Spices and herbs of your choice (e.g., thyme, rosemary, garlic powder)
- 4-6 slices of bacon or pancetta
- 1 pound (450g) unsalted butter, cut into small pieces

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 300°F (150°C).
2. Cut the veiny piece of beef into four equal-sized pieces.
3. Remove the skin from the beef and tenderize it using a meat tenderizer.
4. In a small bowl, mix together salt, pepper, and your preferred spices and herbs.
5. Rub the salt and spice mixture all over the beef, ensuring it is well coated. Place the beef in a tray.
6. Let the beef sit in the tray for two days, turning it once a day to ensure even curing.
7. After two days, season the beef again with additional salt and pepper, if desired.
8. Lay the bacon or pancetta slices in the bottom of a large, oven-safe pot.
9. Place the seasoned beef on top of the bacon or pancetta slices.
10. Scatter the pieces of butter over the beef.
11. Cover the pot with a lid or aluminum foil, ensuring it is tightly sealed.
12. Bake the pot beef in the preheated oven for approximately 4-5 hours, or until the beef is tender and easily pulls apart.
13. Once cooked, remove the pot beef from the pot using a slotted spoon or skimmer, and transfer it to a mortar.
14. Remove any veins and skins from the beef and discard them.
15. Pound the beef in the mortar with a little bit of the butter that was skimmed off during cooking.
16. Transfer the pounded beef to another pot or container.
17. Pour the remaining melted butter from the pot over the pounded beef, ensuring the gravy is kept separate.
18. If the melted butter is not enough to cover the beef by at least an inch, clarify additional butter and add it to the pot.
19. Let the pot beef cool for four days in a cool place before cutting and serving.
20. Serve the pot beef cold or reheat it gently before serving.
