# Pot Roasted Salmon

## Description
Pot roasted salmon is a classic dish that involves seasoning the salmon with a blend of spices and baking it in a pot with melted butter. The result is a flavorful and tender salmon that is perfect for a special dinner or gathering.

## Ingredients:
- 1 salmon fillet (approximately 500g)
- Salt
- Pepper
- 2 cloves
- 1/2 teaspoon ground mace
- 2 bay leaves
- 200g unsalted butter
- Small white bread slices for serving

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 180Â°C.
2. Season the salmon fillet with salt, pepper, cloves, and ground mace. Place the bay leaves on top of the seasoned salmon.
3. Take an earthen pot and place the seasoned salmon in it.
4. Melt the unsalted butter in a saucepan over low heat until completely melted.
5. Pour the melted butter over the salmon in the pot, making sure the salmon is fully covered.
6. Place the pot in the preheated oven and bake for approximately 20-25 minutes, or until the salmon is cooked through and flakes easily with a fork.
7. While the salmon is baking, toast the small white bread slices.
8. Once the salmon is baked, carefully remove it from the pot and transfer it to another serving dish.
9. Strain the melted butter from the pot to remove any solids.
10. Clarify the butter by gently heating it in a saucepan until the solids separate from the clear liquid. Skim off any foam that forms on the surface.
11. Pour the clarified butter over the baked salmon, making sure to cover it completely.
12. Cover the salmon with a lid or foil to keep it warm and let it rest for a few minutes before serving.
13. Serve the pot roasted salmon with the toasted white bread slices on the side.
