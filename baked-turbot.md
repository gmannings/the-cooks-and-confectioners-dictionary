# Baked Turbot

## Description
This recipe is for baking a turbot, a type of flatfish. The turbot is seasoned with a mixture of salt, pepper, nutmeg, cloves, and sweet herbs. It is then placed in a pastry "coffin" and baked in the oven. The inside of the coffin is lined with minced anchovies and onions. The turbot is placed in the coffin with the backside downwards and surrounded by fish meatballs. Oysters, butter, and chopped hard-boiled eggs are added to the coffin. The coffin is baked until the turbot is cooked and then filled with a sauce made from white wine vinegar, oyster liquor, and beaten eggs. The baked turbot is garnished with fried oysters, toasted bread, and served with drawn butter.

## Options and commentary
- Turbot: If turbot is not available, you can use other flatfish such as halibut or sole.
- Sweet herbs: Use a mixture of fresh herbs such as parsley, thyme, and tarragon.
- Anchovies: If you don't like anchovies, you can omit them or use a small amount of fish sauce for added umami flavor.
- Fish meatballs: You can make fish meatballs using any white fish such as cod or haddock. Season them with salt, pepper, and herbs.
- Oysters: Fresh oysters are preferred, but you can also use canned or jarred oysters.
- White wine vinegar: If you don't have white wine vinegar, you can use white wine or lemon juice as a substitute.
- Drawn butter: Drawn butter is simply melted butter. You can serve the turbot with melted butter or a sauce of your choice.
