## Ingredients:
- 1 whole chicken, cut into pieces (or boneless chicken breasts)
- 100g bacon, diced
- 2 tablespoons butter
- 2 veal sweetbreads (optional)
- 4 cockscombs (optional)
- 200g mushrooms, sliced
- 50g truffles, sliced (optional)
- Salt and pepper to taste
- 1 onion, studded with cloves
- A bunch of savory herbs (such as thyme, rosemary, and parsley)
- 2 tablespoons flour
- 500ml chicken broth
- 250ml heavy cream
- 4 egg yolks
- Fresh parsley, chopped

## Instructions:
1. Skin the chicken and remove the shanks and wings. Cut the legs and break the bones with a rolling pin. Remove the flesh from the bones and place it in water.
2. Cut off the wings and breasts from the chicken and cut the carcasses into pieces. Place them in water and blanch them over low heat. Then transfer them to cold water and let them sit for a while. Drain the carcasses.
3. In a large stewpan, melt the bacon and butter over medium heat. Add the veal sweetbreads, cockscombs, mushrooms, and truffles. Season with salt, pepper, the onion studded with cloves, and the savory herbs. Toss everything together.
4. Add the chicken pieces to the stewpan and cook for a few minutes. Sprinkle the flour over the ingredients and stir well. Cook for another 2-3 minutes.
5. Moisten the mixture with half chicken broth and half water. Reduce the heat to low and let it simmer.
6. In a separate bowl, beat the egg yolks with the cream. Add the chopped parsley.
7. Once the liquid in the stewpan has reduced, gradually add the egg and cream mixture while stirring continuously. Cook for a few more minutes until the sauce thickens.
8. Dish the chicken fricassee into plates or small dishes and serve hot.
