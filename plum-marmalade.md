# Plum Marmalade

## Description
This recipe is for making plum marmalade, a sweet and tangy spread made from plums and sugar. The plums are cooked down until soft, then strained and mixed with sugar to create a smooth and flavorful marmalade. It can be enjoyed on toast, scones, or used as a filling for pastries.

## Ingredients:
- Plums (approximately 1 kg)
- Sugar (equal weight to the cooked plums)

## Instructions:
1. If the plums are easily pitted, remove the stones. If not, scald the plums in boiling water until they become very soft.
2. Drain the plums and squeeze them through a sieve to remove the skins and any remaining stones.
3. In a large saucepan, combine the plum puree with an equal weight of cracked sugar.
4. Place the saucepan over medium heat and stir to incorporate the sugar into the plum puree.
5. Allow the mixture to simmer together for some time, stirring occasionally to prevent sticking or burning. The exact cooking time will depend on the desired consistency of the marmalade.
6. Once the marmalade has thickened to your liking, remove it from the heat.
7. Transfer the marmalade into clean, sterilized jars.
8. Sprinkle a layer of sugar over the top of each jar to help preserve the marmalade.
9. Seal the jars tightly and allow them to cool completely before storing in a cool, dark place.

## Cooking time
Approximately 1-2 hours, depending on desired consistency.
