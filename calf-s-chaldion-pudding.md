# Calf's Chaldion Pudding

## Description
Calf's Chaldion Pudding is a traditional 18th-century dish made with calf's chaldron (stomach), minced beef suet or marrow, and various seasonings. It is then stuffed into a sheep's gut and boiled.

## Options and commentary
- Instead of calf's chaldron, you can use beef tripe or another type of offal.
- If you prefer a lighter version, you can use lean ground beef instead of beef suet or marrow.
- Adjust the amount of seasoning according to your taste preferences.
- Serve the pudding with a sauce or gravy of your choice.

## Ingredients:
- 1 calf's chaldron (or beef tripe)
- 500g beef suet or marrow (or lean ground beef)
- Salt
- Nutmeg
- Cloves
- Mace
- Fresh thyme
- Fresh parsley
- 1 onion
- 1 lemon
- 100ml cream
- 4-5 egg yolks
- 1 sheep's gut (available at specialty butcher shops)

## Instructions:
1. Place the calf's chaldron (or beef tripe) in a large pot of boiling water and parboil it for about 30 minutes. Remove from the pot and let it cool.
2. Once cooled, mince the calf's chaldron (or beef tripe) into small pieces.
3. In a separate bowl, mix together the minced calf's chaldron (or beef tripe) and the beef suet or marrow (or lean ground beef).
4. Season the mixture with salt, nutmeg, cloves, and mace. Use about 1 teaspoon of each spice, or adjust to your taste.
5. Finely chop the fresh thyme, parsley, onion, and lemon. Add them to the mixture.
6. Pour in the cream and add the egg yolks. Mix everything together until well combined.
7. Wash the sheep's gut thoroughly with water. Then, soak it in a mixture of salt and white wine for half a day.
8. After soaking, remove the sheep's gut from the salt and wine mixture and rinse it again with water.
9. Stuff the mince-meat and seasoning mixture into the sheep's gut, making sure to pack it tightly.
10. Tie the ends of the sheep's gut securely with kitchen twine to prevent any filling from escaping during cooking.
11. Place the stuffed sheep's gut in a large pot of boiling water and boil it for about 2-3 hours, or until the pudding is cooked through.
12. Once cooked, remove the pudding from the pot and let it cool slightly before serving.

## Cooking time
