# Keeping Grapes

## Description
This recipe provides two methods for keeping grapes for an extended period of time. The first method involves layering grapes with oats in a box, while the second method suggests hanging the grapes on lines in a room. Both methods aim to preserve the grapes by preventing air from reaching them.

## Options and commentary
- The first method with oats in a box is more suitable for smaller quantities of grapes.
