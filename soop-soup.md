# Soop (Soup)

## Description
This recipe is for a hearty and flavorful soup made with a combination of beef, veal, mutton, and bacon. The broth is enriched with white wine, herbs, and spinach. A larded pullet (young chicken) is cooked in the soup and then served with sippets (toasted bread) in a flavorful broth thickened with egg yolks and flavored with orange juice.

## Options and commentary
- Instead of a leg of beef, you can use beef stew meat or beef bones for a richer flavor.
- If you can't find a knuckle of veal, you can use veal stew meat or veal bones.
- The fat end of a neck of mutton can be substituted with lamb stew meat or lamb bones.
- For the faggot of sweet herbs, you can use a combination of parsley, thyme, and bay leaves.
- Spinach can be replaced with other leafy greens such as kale or Swiss chard.
- Instead of a larded pullet, you can use boneless, skinless chicken thighs or breasts.
- Sippets can be made by toasting slices of bread and cutting them into small triangles.

## Ingredients:
- 500g beef stew meat or beef bones
- 500g veal stew meat or veal bones
- 500g lamb stew meat or lamb bones
- 200g bacon, diced
- 2 onions, chopped
- 1 faggot of sweet herbs (parsley, thyme, bay leaves)
- 500g spinach, chopped
- 1 pint (500ml) white wine
- 1 pullet (young chicken), larded with bacon
- Juice of 2 oranges
- 4 egg yolks, beaten
- Sippets (toasted bread)

## Instructions:
1. In a large pot, combine the beef, veal, lamb, bacon, onions, and faggot of sweet herbs. Add enough water to cover the ingredients.
2. Bring the pot to a boil, then reduce the heat to low and simmer for several hours until the meat is tender and the flavors have melded together.
3. Remove the meat from the pot and strain the broth into a separate container. Discard the solids.
4. Return the strained broth to the pot and add the chopped spinach. Cook for another 10 minutes until the spinach is wilted.
5. Meanwhile, in a separate pan, cook the larded pullet until it is fully cooked and tender.
6. Remove the pullet from the pan and set aside.
7. Add the white wine to the pot with the spinach broth and bring to a simmer.
8. In a small bowl, whisk together the beaten egg yolks and the juice of the oranges.
9. Slowly pour the egg yolk mixture into the simmering broth, stirring constantly to prevent curdling.
10. Continue stirring until the soup has thickened slightly.
11. To serve, place the larded pullet in the middle of a dish. Arrange sippets around the pullet.
12. Pour the soup over the pullet and sippets.
13. Serve the soup hot.
