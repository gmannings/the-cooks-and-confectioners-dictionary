# Fricandoes

## Description
Fricandoes are a traditional dish made with thin slices of meat, typically beef or veal, that are garnished or stuffed. They were commonly used to enhance the presentation of elaborate side dishes or served as a separate dish. In this recipe, we will prepare fricandoes by stuffing them.

## Options and commentary
- You can use either beef or veal for this recipe, depending on your preference.
- Larding the fricandoes is optional if you are using them for garnishing.
- The stuffing can be customized with various ingredients like herbs, spices, or vegetables.

## Ingredients:
- 500g beef or veal, thinly sliced
- Bacon or fatback, for larding (optional)
- For the stuffing:
  - 1 onion, finely chopped
  - 2 cloves of garlic, minced
  - 1 carrot, finely chopped
  - 1 celery stalk, finely chopped
  - 1/2 cup breadcrumbs
  - 1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese
  - 1 tablespoon fresh parsley, chopped
  - Salt and pepper, to taste
  - Olive oil, for cooking

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F).

2. If larding the fricandoes, cut the bacon or fatback into thin strips. Make small incisions in the meat slices and insert the bacon strips into the incisions. This step is optional if you are using the fricandoes for garnishing.

3. In a skillet, heat some olive oil over medium heat. Add the chopped onion, garlic, carrot, and celery. Cook until the vegetables are softened and lightly browned.

4. In a mixing bowl, combine the cooked vegetables with breadcrumbs, grated Parmesan cheese, chopped parsley, salt, and pepper. Mix well to form a stuffing mixture.

5. Take each meat slice and place a spoonful of the stuffing mixture in the center. Roll up the meat slice and secure it with toothpicks or kitchen twine to hold its shape.

6. Heat some olive oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Brown the stuffed fricandoes on all sides until they are nicely seared.

7. Transfer the browned fricandoes to a baking dish and cover with foil. Place the dish in the preheated oven and bake for about 30 minutes, or until the meat is cooked through.

8. Remove the fricandoes from the oven and let them rest for a few minutes before serving. Remove the toothpicks or twine before serving.
