# Eggs Poached with Anchovies

## Description
This dish features poached eggs served with a flavorful sauce made with melted butter, anchovies, fried flour, salt, and lemon juice. The combination of the rich and creamy eggs with the savory and tangy sauce creates a delicious and satisfying meal.

## Ingredients:
- 4 eggs
- 4 anchovy fillets
- 2 tablespoons butter

- Salt, to taste
- Juice of 1 lemon

## Instructions:
1. Fill a large saucepan with water and bring it to a gentle simmer over medium heat.
2. Crack each egg into a separate small bowl or ramekin.
3. Carefully slide each egg into the simmering water, one at a time. Poach the eggs for about 3-4 minutes, or until the whites are set but the yolks are still runny.
4. While the eggs are poaching, prepare the sauce. In a small saucepan, melt the butter over medium heat.
5. Add the anchovy fillets to the melted butter and cook for about 1-2 minutes, until the anchovies have dissolved.
6. Sprinkle the flour into the saucepan and stir well to combine. Cook for another minute, stirring constantly.
7. Slowly pour in the lemon juice, stirring continuously, until the sauce thickens and becomes smooth.
8. Season the sauce with salt to taste.
9. Remove the poached eggs from the water using a slotted spoon and place them on a serving dish.
10. Trim the edges of the poached eggs with a knife to give them a neat appearance.
11. Pour the anchovy sauce over the poached eggs, making sure to cover them evenly.
