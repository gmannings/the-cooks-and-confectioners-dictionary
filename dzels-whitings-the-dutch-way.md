# Dzels Whitings the Dutch Way

## Description
This recipe is a traditional Dutch method for preparing Whitings (a type of fish). The fish is scaled and gutted, then scored on both sides before being boiled. It is served with a sauce made from boiled turnips and parsley, poured over the fish and served on sippets (toasted bread slices).

## Options and commentary
- Instead of Whitings, you can use any white fish fillets such as cod or haddock.
- If you prefer a different vegetable, you can substitute turnips with potatoes or carrots.
- You can adjust the amount of parsley according to your taste preference.

## Ingredients:
- 4 Whitings (or white fish fillets)
- 4 turnips
- 2 tablespoons butter
- 2 tablespoons flour
- 1 cup water
- Salt, to taste
- Fresh parsley, minced
- Sippets (toasted bread slices)

## Instructions:
1. Scale and gut the Whitings (or prepare the fish fillets).
2. Score the back-bone of the fish on both sides with a knife.
3. Place the fish in a bowl of cold water and let them soak for an hour.
4. In a large pot, bring water, vinegar, and salt to a boil.
5. Add the soaked fish to the boiling water and cook until they are fully cooked and tender. This should take about 10-15 minutes.
6. While the fish is cooking, peel and cut the turnips into pieces about the size of yolks of eggs.
7. In a separate pot, boil the turnips in water with salt until they are tender. Drain the turnips and set them aside.
8. In a saucepan, melt the butter over medium heat. Add the flour and cook for a minute, stirring constantly.
9. Gradually whisk in the water to form a smooth sauce. Cook for a few minutes until the sauce thickens.
10. Add the boiled turnips and minced parsley to the sauce. Stir well to combine.
11. Toast the bread slices to make sippets.
12. Place the cooked Whitings on the sippets and pour the turnip sauce over them.
13. Garnish with shredded parsley.
14. Serve the dish hot.
