# Dressed Duck with Green Peas

## Description
This recipe is for a dressed duck served with a flavorful green pea ragout. The duck is first braised and then topped with a sauce made from green peas, butter, herbs, and gravy. The dish is rich and savory, with a touch of creaminess from the egg and cream mixture.

## Ingredients:
- 1 whole duck
- 500g green peas (fresh or frozen)
- 50g butter
- Salt and pepper to taste
- 1 tablespoon flour
- 1 faggot of savory herbs (such as thyme, rosemary, and parsley)
- 250ml gravy
- 1 egg yolk
- 50ml cream

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 180°C.
2. Dress the duck by removing any excess fat or feathers. Season it with salt and pepper.
3. Place the duck in a roasting pan and roast in the preheated oven for about 2 hours, or until the skin is crispy and the meat is cooked through. Baste the duck with its own juices every 30 minutes.
4. While the duck is roasting, prepare the green pea ragout. In a saucepan, melt the butter over medium heat.
5. Add the green peas to the saucepan and sauté for a few minutes until they are slightly softened.
6. Season the peas with salt, pepper, and a dusting of flour. Stir well to coat the peas evenly.
7. Add the faggot of savory herbs to the saucepan and pour in the gravy. Stir to combine.
8. Simmer the peas in the gravy for about 10 minutes, or until they are tender and the flavors have melded together.
9. In a small bowl, whisk together the egg yolk and cream until well combined.
10. Remove the faggot of herbs from the saucepan and discard. Gradually pour the egg and cream mixture into the saucepan, stirring constantly.
11. Continue to cook the pea ragout over low heat for another 2-3 minutes, or until the sauce has thickened slightly.
12. Once the duck is cooked, remove it from the oven and let it rest for a few minutes.
13. Carve the duck into serving portions and arrange them on a serving platter.
14. Pour the green pea ragout over the duck, ensuring that each portion is generously covered.
15. Serve the dressed duck with green peas immediately.

## Cooking time
Approximately 2 hours for roasting the duck, plus additional time for preparation and cooking the green pea ragout.
