# Syrup of Raspberries

## Description
This recipe is for making a syrup of raspberries. The raspberries are soaked in wine for several days to extract their flavor, then strained and sweetened to create a syrup. The syrup can be used as a sweetener or flavoring in various dishes and beverages.

## Options and commentary
- Instead of Canary wine, you can use a dry white wine or a sweet dessert wine like Port or Madeira.
- If you prefer a less sweet syrup, you can reduce the amount of sugar added.
- This syrup can be used in cocktails, desserts, or as a topping for pancakes or waffles.

## Ingredients:
- 2 kg raspberries
- 2 liters wine (Canary wine, dry white wine, or sweet dessert wine)
- 500 g sugar

## Instructions:
1. In a large earthenware or glass container, combine the raspberries and wine.
2. Cover the container tightly with a lid or seal it with pastry dough to create a tight seal.
3. Place the container in a cool place and let it sit for 10 days, allowing the raspberries to infuse the wine.
4. After 10 days, strain the mixture through a fine-mesh sieve or cheesecloth to remove the raspberries, pressing down on the solids to extract as much liquid as possible.
5. Measure the remaining liquid and add an equal amount of sugar. For example, if you have 1 liter of liquid, add 1 kg of sugar.
6. In a large saucepan, combine the liquid and sugar and bring to a boil over medium heat, stirring constantly to dissolve the sugar.
7. Skim off any foam that rises to the surface while the syrup is boiling.
8. Reduce the heat to low and simmer the syrup for about 10 minutes, or until it reaches a syrup-like consistency.
9. Remove the syrup from the heat and let it cool completely.
10. Once cooled, transfer the syrup to sterilized bottles or jars and seal tightly.
11. Store the syrup in the refrigerator for up to 1 month.

## Cooking time
Approximately 10 days for infusing the raspberries in wine, plus 20 minutes for boiling the syrup.
