# Churned Cream

## Description
Churned Cream is a simple and delicious dessert made from thick cream, rosewater, and sugar. It has a light and fluffy texture, similar to whipped cream, and a delicate floral flavor from the rosewater.

## Ingredients:
- 2 liters of thick cream
- 4 tablespoons of rosewater
- 115 grams of fine sugar

## Instructions:
1. In a large bowl, combine the thick cream, rosewater, and fine sugar.
2. Using a hand mixer or a stand mixer fitted with a whisk attachment, beat the mixture on medium-high speed until it thickens and forms soft peaks. This should take about 5-7 minutes.
3. Transfer the mixture to a churn or a large jar with a tight-fitting lid.
4. Begin churning the cream by vigorously shaking the churn or jar. If using a churn, follow the manufacturer's instructions for churning.
5. As the cream churns, you will notice the froth rising to the top. Use a spoon or a skimmer to remove the froth and transfer it to a separate dish.
6. Continue churning until the cream thickens even further and reaches a consistency similar to whipped cream. This should take about 15-20 minutes of churning.
7. Once the cream has reached the desired consistency, transfer it to a serving dish.
8. Serve the churned cream immediately, or refrigerate it for a few hours to allow it to set further.
