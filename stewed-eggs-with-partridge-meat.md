# Stewed Eggs with Partridge Meat

## Description
This recipe is a rich and flavorful dish that combines minced partridge meat with eggs. The meat is stewed in a savory mutton gravy with the addition of anchovies for an umami boost. The eggs are then added and cooked until done. The dish is finished with a hint of nutmeg, orange juice, and garnished with whole onions.

## Options and commentary
- If partridge is not available, you can substitute it with chicken or any other poultry meat.
- If you don't have mutton gravy, you can use chicken or beef broth as a substitute.
- If you don't have anchovies, you can use fish sauce for a similar umami flavor.
- The whole onions can be served as a garnish or cooked with the dish for added flavor.
