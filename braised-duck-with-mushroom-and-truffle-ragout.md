# Braised Duck with Mushroom and Truffle Ragout

## Description
This recipe is a modernized version of an 18th-century dish that features a braised duck served with a flavorful mushroom and truffle ragout. The duck is first braised to achieve tender and juicy meat, and then it is topped with a rich ragout made with mushrooms, truffles, bacon, gravy, veal, ham, and oysters. The combination of these ingredients creates a delicious and sophisticated dish.

## Options and commentary
- If you don't have access to truffles, you can use truffle oil or truffle salt to add a hint of truffle flavor to the ragout.
- Feel free to adjust the amount of mushrooms and truffles according to your taste preferences.
- Serve this dish with roasted potatoes or a side of steamed vegetables for a complete meal.

## Ingredients:
- 1 whole duck, dressed
- 200g mushrooms, sliced
- 50g truffles, thinly sliced
- 100g bacon, diced
- 250ml gravy
- 250ml veal stock
- 100g cooked ham, diced
- 12 oysters, shucked
- Salt and pepper, to taste

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F).
2. In a large oven-safe skillet or Dutch oven, heat some oil over medium-high heat.
3. Season the duck with salt and pepper, then sear it in the hot oil until browned on all sides. Remove the duck from the skillet and set it aside.
4. In the same skillet, add the diced bacon and cook until crispy. Remove the bacon from the skillet, leaving the rendered fat behind.
5. Add the sliced mushrooms and truffles to the skillet and sauté until they are tender and lightly browned.
6. Pour in the gravy and veal stock, stirring to combine. Bring the mixture to a simmer.
7. Add the diced ham and crispy bacon back to the skillet and stir well.
8. In a separate saucepan, heat the shucked oysters in their own liquor over medium heat for 3-4 minutes. Remove the oysters from the saucepan and clean them well.
9. Add the cleaned oysters to the mushroom and truffle ragout, stirring gently. Be careful not to let the mixture boil.
10. Place the seared duck back into the skillet with the ragout, nestling it into the mixture.
11. Transfer the skillet to the preheated oven and roast for about 1.5 to 2 hours, or until the duck is cooked through and tender.
12. Remove the skillet from the oven and let the duck rest for a few minutes.
13. To serve, transfer the duck to a serving dish and spoon the mushroom and truffle ragout over the top.
14. Serve the braised duck with the ragout immediately.
