# Spring Garden Week

## Description
This recipe consists of two dishes: "Larded Beef" and "Stewed Leg of Beef." The first dish involves larding a piece of lean beef with bacon and baking it with various seasonings. The second dish requires stewing a leg of beef in water, salt, pepper, and herbs, then adding ale and serving it with toast.

## Options and commentary
- For the larded beef, you can use pork loin instead of bacon for larding.
- You can add additional vegetables like carrots, onions, and celery to the stewed leg of beef for added flavor.
- Serve the stewed leg of beef with mashed potatoes or roasted vegetables instead of toast.
