# Fried Roaches

## Description
Fried Roaches is a dish made from small fish, traditionally roaches, that are scaled, gutted, and fried until crispy. The fried fish are then served with a flavorful sauce made from butter, sage, parsley, and a tangy anchovy sauce. This dish is a unique and historical recipe that showcases the flavors and techniques of the 18th century.

## Ingredients:
- 500 grams small fish (such as smelt or sardines), scaled and gutted
- Salt
- Water
- Flour
- 50 grams butter
- Fresh sage leaves
- Fresh parsley leaves
- 1 anchovy fillet
- 2 tablespoons hot water
- Parsley and strawberry leaves for garnish

## Instructions:
1. Scale and gut the small fish. Rinse them in salted water and pat them dry with a kitchen towel.
2. Coat the fish in flour, shaking off any excess.
3. In a frying pan, melt the butter over medium heat.
4. Fry the fish in the melted butter until they are brown and crispy on both sides. This may take about 3-4 minutes per side, depending on the size of the fish. Remove the fried fish from the pan and transfer them to a heated dish. Keep them warm near the fire.
5. Pour off the butter used for frying the fish.
6. In the same pan, add a little more butter and fry the sage and parsley leaves until they are crispy. Remove them from the pan and set them aside.
7. In a small bowl, combine the hot water and anchovy fillet, mashing the anchovy until it dissolves in the water.
8. In a separate pan, melt some butter and add the anchovy water mixture. Stir well to combine.
9. Pour the anchovy sauce over the fried fish in the heated dish.
10. Garnish the dish with parsley and strawberry leaves.
11. Serve the Fried Roaches immediately.
