# Pippin Tarts

## Description
Pippin Tarts are a traditional 18th-century dessert made with tart apples called Pippins. The apples are paired with quince slices and flavored with citrus peel and cinnamon. The tart is sweetened with sugar and baked until golden brown.

## Options and commentary
- Pippins: Pippins are a type of tart apple. If you can't find Pippins, you can use Granny Smith or any other tart apple variety.
- Quince: Quince is a fruit that is similar to an apple or pear. If you can't find quince, you can substitute with thinly sliced pear.
- Scrapings of Orange or Lemon-peel: Use the zest of an orange or lemon as a substitute for the scrapings.
- Syrup of Quinces or Pippins: If you can't find quince or pippin syrup, you can use apple juice or apple cider as a substitute.
