# Pigeon Pie

## Description
This recipe is for a traditional French-style pigeon pie. It features a flaky pastry crust filled with scalded pigeons, artichoke bottoms, veal sweetbreads, capon livers, and mushrooms. The pie is then baked until golden brown and served with a creamy white sauce.

## Ingredients:
- Pastry:
  - 1 egg
  - 100g butter
  - Pinch of salt
  - 200ml water
- Filling:
  - 4 pigeons
  - 100g lard, melted
  - 4 artichoke bottoms, quartered
  - 2 veal sweetbreads, halved
  - Livers of 2 capons
  - 100g mushrooms, picked and cut into square pieces
  - 1 tablespoon flour
- Sauce:
  - 50g butter, melted
  - 50g flour
  - 500ml milk
  - Salt and pepper to taste

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 180Â°C.
2. In a mixing bowl, combine the egg, butter, salt, and water to make the pastry. Mix until well combined.
3. Roll out the pastry on a floured surface and line a pie pan with it.
4. Scald the pigeons by placing them in boiling water for a few minutes. Remove and set aside.
5. In a stewpan, combine the melted lard, quartered artichoke bottoms, halved veal sweetbreads, capon livers, and mushrooms. Sprinkle with flour and season with salt and pepper. Stew the ingredients together until well cooked.
6. Pour the melted butter into the pastry-lined pie pan.
7. Moisten the pigeons and place an artichoke bottom in the middle of the stewpan. Arrange the pigeons around it and fill the empty spaces with the veal sweetbreads and stewed ingredients.
8. Cover the pie with the remaining pastry, making a border around the edges.
9. Bake the pie in the preheated oven for approximately 45 minutes or until the crust is golden brown.
10. While the pie is baking, prepare the white sauce. In a saucepan, melt the butter and stir in the flour to make a roux. Gradually whisk in the milk until the sauce thickens. Season with salt and pepper.
11. Once the pie is cooked, remove it from the oven and let it cool slightly.
12. Serve the pigeon pie with the white sauce poured over the top.
