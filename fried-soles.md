# Fried Soles

## Description
Fried Soles is a classic dish made with fresh sole fish that is coated in flour and fried until crispy and golden brown. It is typically served as a first course and can be enjoyed with a sprinkle of salt, pepper, and a squeeze of lemon or orange juice.

## Ingredients:
- 4 sole fish
- Flour, for dredging
- Clarified butter, for frying
- Salt and pepper, to taste
- Lemon or orange wedges, for serving
- Fresh parsley, for garnish

## Instructions:
1. Gut the sole fish and rinse them under cold water to remove any impurities.
2. Pat the fish dry with a clean cloth or paper towels.
3. Dredge each sole fish in flour, making sure to coat both sides evenly.
4. Heat a generous amount of clarified butter in a frying pan over medium-high heat.
5. Once the butter is hot, carefully place the coated sole fish in the pan.
6. Fry the fish until they are golden brown and crispy on both sides, about 2-3 minutes per side.
7. Remove the fried soles from the pan and drain them on a paper towel-lined plate to remove any excess oil.
8. Arrange the fried soles on a serving dish lined with a napkin.
9. Garnish the dish with fried parsley for added flavor and presentation.
10. Serve the fried soles hot as a first course, accompanied by salt, pepper, and lemon or orange wedges for squeezing over the fish.
