# Larded Rabbit Pie

## Description
This recipe is for a larded rabbit pie, a dish commonly enjoyed in the 18th century. The rabbit is parboiled, boned, and seasoned with a variety of spices. It is then placed in a pie crust along with forcemeat balls and topped with butter. The pie is baked until golden and then filled with clarified butter. 

## Options and commentary
- Instead of rabbit, you can use chicken or turkey as a modern alternative.
- Forcemeat balls can be made with a mixture of ground meat, breadcrumbs, herbs, and spices.
- The pie can be served hot or cold, depending on personal preference.
