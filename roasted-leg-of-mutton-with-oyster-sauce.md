## Description
This recipe is for a classic roasted leg of mutton, stuffed with a flavorful mixture of mutton fat, salt, pepper, nutmeg, and egg yolks. The mutton is then roasted until cooked to perfection and served with a delicious oyster sauce.

## Ingredients:
- 1 leg of mutton
- 200g mutton fat (or substitute with butter)
- Salt, to taste

- 4 egg yolks
- Cloves, for sticking
- 1 pint (500ml) oysters, with their liquor
