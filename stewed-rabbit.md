# Stewed Rabbit

## Description
Stewed rabbit is a classic dish that involves boiling rabbit until partially cooked, then cutting it into pieces and stewing it in a flavorful broth. The meat becomes tender and infused with the flavors of the broth, resulting in a delicious and comforting dish.

## Ingredients:
- 2-3 rabbits
- Salt
- Pepper
- Oil
- Juice of 1 lemon

## Instructions:
1. In a large pot, bring water to a boil. Add the rabbits and cook them until they are about halfway done. This will help to tenderize the meat.
2. Remove the rabbits from the pot and let them cool slightly. Cut the rabbits into pieces at the joints, removing the meat from the bones. Leave some meat on the bones for added flavor.
3. Place the meat and bones back into the pot with the cooking liquid from earlier. Make sure there is enough liquid to cover the meat.
4. Set the pot over a chafing dish of coals, or use a low heat setting on your stove. Place two dishes on either side of the pot to create a makeshift double boiler. This will help to evenly distribute the heat and prevent scorching.
5. Let the meat and bones stew in the liquid for about 1-2 hours, or until the meat is tender and fully cooked.
6. Season the stew with salt and pepper to taste. Add a drizzle of oil to enhance the flavor.
7. Just before removing the stew from the heat, squeeze in the juice of one lemon. This will add a bright and tangy flavor to the dish.
8. Once the stew has cooked enough, transfer everything to a serving dish and serve hot.
