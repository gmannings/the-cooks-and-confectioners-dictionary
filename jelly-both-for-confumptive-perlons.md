# Jelly-both for confumptive Perlons

## Description
Jelly-both is a type of broth or stock that was commonly used in 18th century cooking. It was often recommended for individuals suffering from consumption (a term used for tuberculosis). This recipe combines various meats and is boiled to create a flavorful broth.

## Ingredients:
- 1 joint of mutton
- 1 capon (chicken)
- 1 filet of veal
- 3 liters of water

## Instructions:
1. In a large earthen pot, combine the joint of mutton, capon, filet of veal, and water.
2. Place the pot over a gentle fire and bring the mixture to a boil.
3. Allow the mixture to simmer over the gentle fire until half of the liquid has evaporated. This may take several hours.
4. Once the liquid has reduced, remove the pot from the fire and let it cool slightly.
5. Using a clean linen cloth, strain the liquid to remove any solids. Squeeze the cloth to extract as much liquid as possible.
6. Discard the solids and transfer the strained liquid (jelly-both) to a clean container.
7. Allow the jelly-both to cool completely before using or storing.

## Cooking time
Approximately 4-6 hours, depending on the heat of the fire and desired reduction.
