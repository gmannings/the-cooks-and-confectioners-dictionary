# Broiled Conger

## Description
Broiled Conger is a simple and flavorful dish made with fresh conger eel. The eel is scalded, cut into pieces, seasoned with herbs, and then broiled to perfection. It is served with a tangy butter and vinegar sauce, along with a garnish of herbs and parsley.

## Ingredients:
- 1 fresh conger eel
- Salt
- Fresh thyme
- Fresh savory
- Fresh rosemary
- Olive oil
- 2 tablespoons butter
- 2 tablespoons vinegar
- Fresh parsley

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the broiler in your oven.
2. Bring a large pot of water to a boil. 
3. Carefully place the conger eel into the boiling water and let it scald for about 1 minute. This will help remove any slime from the eel.
4. Remove the eel from the pot and let it cool slightly. 
5. Cut the eel into pieces, ensuring that each piece is of similar size for even cooking.
6. Season the eel pieces with salt on both sides.
7. In a small bowl, combine the fresh thyme, savory, and rosemary. Finely chop the herbs and mix them with enough olive oil to create a basting mixture.
8. Place the eel pieces on a broiler pan or a baking sheet lined with aluminum foil.
9. Brush the herb and oil mixture over the eel pieces, making sure to coat them evenly.
10. Place the eel under the broiler and cook for about 5-7 minutes on each side, or until the eel is cooked through and nicely browned.
11. While the eel is broiling, prepare the sauce. In a small saucepan, melt the butter over low heat. Once melted, remove from heat and stir in the vinegar.
12. Remove the broiled eel from the oven and transfer it to a serving platter.
13. Pour the melted butter and vinegar sauce over the eel.
14. Garnish the dish with fresh parsley and any remaining herbs from the basting mixture.
15. Serve the broiled conger eel immediately, with the sauce and herbs on the side.
