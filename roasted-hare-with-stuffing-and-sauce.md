# Roasted Hare with Stuffing and Sauce

## Description
This recipe is for roasting a hare with a flavorful stuffing and serving it with a tangy sauce. The hare is first prepared by removing the bowels and stuffing the belly with a mixture of ingredients. It is then roasted until cooked through. The skin is removed and coated with a mixture of grated bread, flour, and cinnamon to create a crispy crust. The hare is served on a bed of sauce made with claret, vinegar, ginger, cinnamon, barberries, and a touch of sugar. It is garnished with lemon and parsley for added freshness.

## Options and commentary
- Instead of hare, you can use rabbit as a modern alternative.
- If you prefer a milder flavor, you can omit the cinnamon from the stuffing and crust.
- Adjust the amount of sugar in the sauce according to your taste preference.
