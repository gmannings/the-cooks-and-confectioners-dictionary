# Anchovies

## Description
Anchovies are commonly eaten as salads, dressed with oil, vinegar, sliced lemons, capers, and olives. They can also be used to make cullis, which is an ingredient in various meat and fish ragouts. The bones of the anchovies can be used to make a paste with flour, white wine or water, eggs, and melted butter. This paste can be fried and used as a garnish or served with orange and fried parsley.

- For the cullis, you can use it as a base for meat or fish ragouts, adding it to the sauce to enhance the flavor.
