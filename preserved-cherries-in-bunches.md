# Preserved Cherries in Bunches

## Description
This recipe is for preserving cherries in bunches using a sugar syrup. The cherries are tied together with thread and then boiled in a sugar syrup. After boiling, they are skimmed and left to cool in a pan. The next day, they are dried on slates.

## Ingredients:
- Fair cherries (approximately 500g)
- Thread
- Blown sugar (approximately 500g)

## Instructions:
1. Wash and dry the cherries.
2. Take fair cherries of a pretty equal size and tie them up into little bunches with thread. Make sure the thread is securely tied around the stems of the cherries.
3. In a large pot, prepare a sugar syrup by combining blown sugar and water in a 1:1 ratio by weight. For example, if you have 500g of cherries, use 500g of blown sugar.
4. Place the pot on the stove and bring the sugar syrup to a boil.
5. Carefully add the cherry bunches to the boiling sugar syrup. Make sure they are fully submerged.
6. Allow the cherry bunches to boil in the sugar syrup for about 20 boilings. This means letting them boil for a short period of time, then removing them from the syrup, and repeating the process about 20 times. This helps to preserve the cherries and infuse them with the sugar syrup.
7. After the final boiling, remove the cherry bunches from the sugar syrup and place them on a plate or pan to cool.
8. Skim off any foam or impurities that may have formed on the surface of the sugar syrup.
9. Once the cherry bunches have cooled, transfer them to a stove or dehydrator. Arrange them in a single layer, making sure they are not touching each other.
10. Leave the cherry bunches in the stove or dehydrator for at least 24 hours to dry. This will help remove any excess moisture and preserve the cherries.
11. After drying, carefully remove the cherry bunches from the stove or dehydrator and transfer them to slates or a drying rack.
12. Allow the cherries to air dry on the slates or drying rack for a few more days until they are completely dry and no longer sticky.
13. Once the cherries are dry, they can be stored in an airtight container for future use.

## Cooking time
- Boiling the cherry bunches in the sugar syrup: Approximately 20 boilings (short boiling periods)
- Drying the cherry bunches: At least 24 hours in a stove or dehydrator, plus additional air drying time.
