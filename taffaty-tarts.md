# Taffaty Tarts

## Description
Taffaty tarts are a type of sweet tart made with a rich pastry crust filled with a mixture of cooked apples, sugar, and flavorings. The tarts are then baked until golden and crispy, and served with a sprinkle of sugar and a hint of floral essence.

## Options and commentary
- You can use any type of tart apple for this recipe, such as Granny Smith or Braeburn.
- If you don't have access to candied orange peel, you can substitute with a teaspoon of orange zest.
- Essence of violets or roses can be found in specialty baking stores or online. If you can't find them, you can omit this step or use a small amount of rose water instead.

## Ingredients:
- 500g all-purpose flour
- 60ml warm water
- 7g instant yeast
- 450g unsalted butter, softened
- 12 egg yolks
- 225g granulated sugar
- 6 tart apples, such as Granny Smith or Braeburn
- 50g granulated sugar
- 1 tablespoon quince marmalade
- 1 tablespoon candied orange peel, finely chopped
- 1 tablespoon rose water
- Additional sugar for sprinkling
- Essence of violets or roses (optional)

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 180Â°C.
2. In a large mixing bowl, combine the flour, warm water, and instant yeast. Mix until a stiff dough forms.
3. Add the softened butter, egg yolks, and granulated sugar to the dough. Mix until well combined and a smooth dough forms.
4. Divide the dough into small balls and roll each ball out into thick plates.
5. Grease a tart pan or individual tart molds and line them with the rolled-out dough, making sure to press the dough into the edges and up the sides.
6. In a saucepan, boil the tart apples until soft. Peel them and scrape the pulp from the cores.
7. In a separate bowl, mix together the apple pulp, granulated sugar, quince marmalade, candied orange peel, and rose water until well combined.
8. Spoon the apple mixture into the prepared tart shells, filling them to the top.
9. Place the tarts in the preheated oven and bake for 25-30 minutes, or until the crust is golden and crispy.
10. Remove the tarts from the oven and let them cool slightly.
11. Sprinkle sugar over the tarts while they are still warm.
12. If desired, sprinkle a small amount of essence of violets or roses over the tarts for a floral aroma.
13. Serve the taffaty tarts warm or at room temperature.
