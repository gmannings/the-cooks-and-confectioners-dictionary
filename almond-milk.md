# Almond Milk

## Description
Almond milk is a dairy-free alternative to cow's milk made from ground almonds and water. It can be used as a substitute in various recipes or enjoyed on its own as a refreshing drink.

## Options and commentary
- You can use store-bought almond milk instead of making it from scratch.
- Adjust the sweetness and flavorings according to your preference.
- You can serve almond milk hot or cold, depending on your preference.

## Ingredients:
- 250g sweet almonds
- 50g bitter almonds (optional)
- 1 liter milk
- 1 stick of cinnamon
- Pinch of salt
- Sugar to taste
- Zest of 1-2 lemons
- 6 eggs (optional)
- Small crusts of bread (optional)

## Instructions:
1. Blanch the almonds: Place the almonds in a bowl and pour boiling water over them. Let them sit for a few minutes, then drain and rinse with cold water. Remove the skins by gently squeezing the almonds between your fingers. Discard the skins.

2. Grind the almonds: Place the blanched almonds in a mortar and pound them until they form a fine paste. Sprinkle them with a little milk while pounding to prevent them from turning.

3. Mix with warm milk: In a saucepan, warm the milk until it is lukewarm. Add the ground almonds to the milk and mix well. Strain as much of the mixture as possible through a sieve to remove any almond solids.

4. Boil the mixture: Pour the strained almond milk into a clean saucepan. Add the cinnamon stick and place the saucepan over medium heat. Stir the mixture continuously with a spoon until it comes to a creamy consistency.

5. Sweeten and season: Once the almond milk begins to thicken, add a pinch of salt and sweeten it with sugar to taste. Stir well to incorporate the sugar. If desired, add small crusts of bread to the serving dish.

6. Serve hot: Pour the hot almond milk over the bread crusts in the serving dish. Serve immediately.

7. Serve cold (meal version): In a separate saucepan, combine the cream, milk, and pounded almonds. Add the cinnamon stick, salt, sugar, and lemon zest. Mix well. Strain the mixture through a sieve, incorporating the eggs. 

8. Steam the almond milk: Place a saucepan of water over medium heat and bring it to a boil. Place a dish over the saucepan and pour the almond milk mixture into the dish. Cover the dish with a lid that fits well. Place live coals on top of the lid to create steam. Check the consistency of the almond milk occasionally. Once it has thickened, remove it from the heat and let it cool.

9. Serve cold: Serve the almond milk cold in small dishes or plates.

## Cooking time
- Approximately 30 minutes for the hot version
- Approximately 1 hour for the cold version
