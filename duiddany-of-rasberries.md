# Duiddany of Rasberries

## Description
Duiddany of Rasberries is a sweet raspberry syrup that can be used as a topping for desserts or added to beverages. It is made by stewing raspberries, straining the liquid, and then boiling it with sugar and a hint of fragrance from either Ambergreeſe or Musk.

## Ingredients:
- 500g raspberries
- 500g double-refined sugar
- A pinch of Ambergreeſe or Musk

## Instructions:
1. Pick the raspberries, removing any stems or leaves. Place them in a pot.
2. Close the pot tightly to prevent any steam from escaping.
3. Fill a kettle with water and bring it to a boil.
4. Place the pot of raspberries into the boiling water, making sure the water level is high enough to cover the pot.
5. Allow the raspberries to stew in the boiling water for approximately 1 hour.
6. After an hour, carefully remove the pot from the boiling water.
7. Using a fine-mesh strainer or cheesecloth, strain the liquid from the raspberry pulp. Discard the pulp.
8. Measure the strained raspberry liquid and add an equal weight of double-refined sugar to it.
9. Optional: Add a pinch of Ambergreeſe or Musk for fragrance. Adjust the amount according to personal preference.
10. Place the raspberry liquid, sugar, and fragrance (if using) in a pot.
11. Bring the mixture to a boil over high heat, stirring constantly to dissolve the sugar.
12. Once the mixture reaches a rolling boil, reduce the heat to medium-high and continue boiling for a few more minutes, until the syrup thickens slightly.
13. Be careful not to overcook the syrup, as it may lose its vibrant color.
14. Remove the pot from the heat and allow the syrup to cool.
15. Once cooled, transfer the Duiddany of Rasberries to a clean, airtight container for storage.

## Cooking time
Approximately 1 hour stewing time for the raspberries, plus additional time for boiling the syrup.
