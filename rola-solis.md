# Rola Solis

## Description
Rola Solis is a traditional 18th-century herbal liqueur made by infusing the herb Rofa Solis in brandy. It is sweetened with sugar and flavored with cinnamon. This liqueur has a unique herbal and aromatic taste.

## Ingredients:
- 8 handfuls of Rofa Solis herb
- 1 gallon (3.8 liters) of brandy
- 3 pounds (1.4 kg) of double refined sugar
- 3 pints (1.4 liters) of milk-water (equal parts milk and water)
- 1 ounce (28 grams) of powdered cinnamon
- 1 ounce (28 grams) of white sugar candy
- 4 grains of musk

## Instructions:
1. In a large container, combine the Rofa Solis herb and brandy. Make sure the herb is fully submerged in the brandy.
2. Cover the container and let the herb infuse in the brandy for at least 2 weeks. The longer it infuses, the stronger the flavor will be.
3. After the infusion period, strain the herb-infused brandy through a cloth to remove any solids. Make sure to squeeze the cloth to extract as much liquid as possible.
4. In a separate bowl, combine the double refined sugar, milk-water, powdered cinnamon, white sugar candy, and musk.
5. Stir the sugar mixture until the sugar and candy are fully dissolved.
6. Add the strained herb-infused brandy to the sugar mixture and stir well to combine.
7. Once everything is well mixed, strain the mixture again through a cloth to remove any impurities.
8. Transfer the strained Rola Solis liqueur into clean bottles or jars for storage.
9. Seal the bottles or jars tightly and let the liqueur age for at least a month before consuming. The flavors will continue to develop and mellow over time.
