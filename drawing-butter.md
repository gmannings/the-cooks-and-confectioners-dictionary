# Drawing Butter

## Description
Drawing butter is a process of melting and emulsifying butter to create a smooth and creamy texture. This method was commonly used in the 18th century to prepare butter for various dishes.

## Options and commentary
- You can use any type of butter for this recipe, such as salted or unsalted.
- If you prefer a richer flavor, you can use chicken or vegetable broth instead of water.
- Be careful not to overheat the butter, as it can easily curdle and become unusable.

## Ingredients:
- 500g butter
- 500ml strong broth (chicken or vegetable)
- Additional broth or water, as needed

## Instructions:
1. In a medium-sized pot or pipkin, pour in the strong broth.
2. Break the butter into small pieces and add them to the pot.
3. Place the pot over medium heat and start stirring the mixture with a ladle.
4. As the butter melts, gradually add more butter, about 250g at a time, and stir continuously.
5. If the mixture becomes too thick, add a small amount of additional broth or water to maintain a smooth consistency.
6. Continue stirring until all the butter has melted and the mixture appears white and creamy.
7. Be careful not to let the mixture boil or overheat, as this can cause it to curdle.
8. If the mixture turns yellow and curdles, it is difficult to recover, so it's important to monitor the heat and stirring constantly.

## Cooking time
Approximately 15-20 minutes, depending on the heat level and the amount of butter being melted.
