# Duck a la Braise

## Description
Duck a la Braise is a classic French dish where a duck is slowly cooked in a flavorful broth until tender and juicy. The duck is first larded with bacon and then braised with a combination of vegetables, herbs, and spices. The resulting dish is rich, aromatic, and full of flavor.

## Ingredients:
- 1 whole duck
- 200g bacon, cut into large lardons
- 200g beef, sliced
- 2 parsnips, sliced
- 2 carrots, sliced
- 1 onion, sliced
- Salt and pepper to taste
- 4 cloves
- A handful of fresh herbs (such as thyme, rosemary, and parsley)
- 2 lemons, sliced
- Sippets (toasted bread slices) for serving

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 160°C (320°F).
2. Take the duck and carefully lard it with the large lardons of bacon. Insert the lardons into the flesh of the duck, spacing them evenly.
3. In a large stew-pan, arrange a layer of bacon bards and slices of beef at the bottom.
4. Add the sliced parsnips, carrots, and onions on top of the bacon and beef.
5. Season the vegetables with salt, pepper, and cloves.
6. Place the fresh herbs and slices of lemon on top of the vegetables.
7. Carefully place the larded duck on top of the herbs and lemon slices.
8. Cover the duck with the remaining vegetables, herbs, and lemon slices, following the same arrangement as before.
9. Cover the stew-pan with a lid.
10. Place the stew-pan on the stove over medium heat and let it come to a simmer.
11. Once simmering, transfer the stew-pan to the preheated oven.
12. Braise the duck in the oven for approximately 2-3 hours, or until the meat is tender and easily pulls away from the bone.
13. Remove the stew-pan from the oven and carefully transfer the duck to a serving dish, placing it on sippets (toasted bread slices).
14. Pour the ragout (the braising liquid and vegetables) over the duck.
15. Serve the Duck a la Braise hot.
