# Sugar Candy

## Description
Sugar Candy is a sweet confection made from boiled sugar that has been coagulated around sticks. It is a popular treat that can be enjoyed on its own or used as a decorative element in desserts.

## Options and commentary
- You can use regular granulated sugar for this recipe.
- Instead of using sticks, you can use lollipop sticks or wooden skewers.
- The cooking time may vary depending on the desired thickness and hardness of the candy.

## Ingredients:
- 500g granulated sugar
- Sticks (lollipop sticks or wooden skewers)

## Instructions:
1. In a large pot, bring the granulated sugar and 250ml of water to a boil over medium heat. Stir until the sugar has completely dissolved.
2. Continue boiling the sugar mixture until it reaches the "blown quality" stage. This is when the sugar syrup reaches a temperature of around 150째C (300째F) and forms a thin thread when dropped into cold water.
3. Once the sugar syrup has reached the desired stage, carefully pour it into an earthen pot or a heat-resistant container.
4. Place the sticks in the pot, laying them across the pot or upright, depending on your preference.
5. If using a stove, place the pot in a preheated oven at a low temperature (around 100째C or 212째F) for 14-15 days. This slow drying process allows the sugar to coagulate around the sticks.
6. Alternatively, you can pour the sugar syrup onto the sticks and let it stand at room temperature for 14-15 days. During this time, the sugar will gradually harden around the sticks.
7. After the initial drying period, pour hot water over the sugar candy at several intervals over the course of a day. This helps to remove any impurities and further harden the candy.
8. Leave the sugar candy to dry for another day.
9. The next morning, carefully break the pot or container to reveal the sugar candy that has formed around the sticks.
10. If desired, you can repeat the process by removing the first crust and placing the remaining sugar candy back in the stove or at room temperature until another crust forms. Repeat this step until the desired amount of sugar candy is achieved.

## Cooking time
- Boiling the sugar syrup: Approximately 10-15 minutes
- Drying and coagulating the sugar candy: 14-15 days
