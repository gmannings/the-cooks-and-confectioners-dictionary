# Collared Mutton

## Description
Collared mutton is a dish made by removing the bones and gristle from a breast of mutton, seasoning it with a mixture of herbs, spices, and breadcrumbs, rolling it up like a collar, and then cooking it by boiling, baking, or roasting. It can be served as a main dish or as a side dish.

## Options and commentary
- You can choose to boil, bake, or roast the collared mutton, depending on your preference and available cooking equipment.
- For the sauce, you can use a strong gravy with dissolved anchovies for a rich and savory flavor.
- To garnish the dish, you can use barberries and lemon slices for a touch of acidity and brightness.
- If serving as a side dish, you can layer the bottom of the dish with cutlets, cabbage, cauliflower, or any seasonal vegetables. You can also add forcemeat balls and black and white puddings for additional variety.

## Ingredients:
- 1 breast of mutton
- Fresh herbs (such as parsley, thyme, and rosemary), finely chopped
- 3 cloves, finely chopped
- 3 hard-boiled eggs, yolks only, grated
- 1 cup breadcrumbs
- 1 lemon, zest only
- Salt and pepper to taste
- 3-4 anchovies, washed and boned
- Tape or kitchen twine for tying
- Strong gravy
- Forcemeat balls
- Fried oysters
- Barberries and lemon slices for garnish
- Optional: cutlets, cabbage, cauliflower, black and white puddings

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F) if baking the collared mutton, or preheat a pot of water if boiling.
2. Remove the red skin from the breast of mutton and discard. Remove all bones and gristle from the meat.
3. In a bowl, combine the chopped herbs, cloves, grated egg yolks, breadcrumbs, lemon zest, salt, and pepper to make the seasoning mixture.
4. Lay the breast of mutton flat on a cutting board. Place the washed and boned anchovies sporadically on the meat.
5. Sprinkle the seasoning mixture evenly over the meat, covering the anchovies.
6. Roll up the breast of mutton tightly, forming a collar shape. Secure the roll with tape or kitchen twine to hold its shape.
7. If boiling, place the collared mutton in the pot of boiling water and cook for approximately 1-2 hours until tender. If baking, place the collared mutton in a baking dish and roast in the preheated oven for approximately 1-2 hours until cooked through.
8. Once cooked, remove the collared mutton from the pot or oven and let it rest for a few minutes.
9. If serving as a main dish, slice the collared mutton into four parts and arrange them on a serving dish.
10. In a saucepan, heat the strong gravy with dissolved anchovies until warmed through. Pour the sauce over the collared mutton.
11. Optionally, add forcemeat balls and fried oysters to the dish for additional flavor and texture.
12. Garnish the dish with barberries and lemon slices if desired.
13. If serving as a side dish, layer the bottom of the serving dish with cutlets, cabbage, cauliflower, or any seasonal vegetables. Add forcemeat balls and black and white puddings around the collared mutton.
14. Serve the collared mutton hot as a main dish or a side dish.
