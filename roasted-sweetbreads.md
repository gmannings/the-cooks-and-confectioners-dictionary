# Roasted Sweetbreads

## Description
Roasted sweetbreads are a delicious and elegant dish that can be served as an appetizer or main course. Sweetbreads are the thymus glands of young animals, usually veal or lamb. They have a delicate flavor and tender texture when cooked properly. In this recipe, the sweetbreads are larded with bacon and roasted to perfection. They are then served with a flavorful sauce made from essence of ham or good gravy.

## Ingredients:
- 2 sweetbreads
- 4 slices of bacon
- Essence of ham or good gravy

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F).
2. Soak the sweetbreads in cold water for about 30 minutes to remove any impurities.
3. Drain the sweetbreads and pat them dry with paper towels.
4. Cut the bacon slices into small lardons.
5. Using a sharp knife, make small incisions in the sweetbreads and insert the bacon lardons into the incisions.
6. Skewer the sweetbreads onto a spit, making sure they are secure.
7. Place the spit over a fire or under a preheated grill.
8. Roast the sweetbreads, turning them occasionally, until they are browned and cooked through. This should take about 20-25 minutes.
9. While the sweetbreads are roasting, prepare the sauce. If using essence of ham, heat it in a small saucepan until warmed through. If using good gravy, heat it in a separate saucepan.
10. Once the sweetbreads are cooked, remove them from the spit and transfer them to a serving dish.
11. Pour the essence of ham or good gravy over the sweetbreads, ensuring they are well coated.
12. Serve the roasted sweetbreads immediately.
