# Roasted Hare with a Bread Stuffing

## Description
This recipe is a modernized version of an 18th-century recipe for roasted hare. The hare is larded with small pieces of fat, then stuffed with a mixture of grated bread, eggs, nutmeg, sugar, currants, salt, cinnamon, and cream. It is then roasted on a spit. The dish is traditionally served with venison sauce.

## Options and commentary
- Instead of larding the hare, you can use bacon or pancetta to wrap it, which will add flavor and keep the meat moist.
- If you don't have currants, you can use raisins or dried cranberries as a substitute.
- Venison sauce can be made by reducing red wine with shallots, thyme, and beef or game stock. You can also serve the hare with a red wine reduction or a fruit-based sauce.

## Ingredients:
- 1 hare
- 100g small pieces of fat (such as bacon or pancetta)
- 100g grated bread
- 2 eggs
- 1/2 teaspoon grated nutmeg
- 1 tablespoon sugar
- 50g currants (or raisins or dried cranberries)
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
- 50ml cream

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 180째C (350째F).
2. Lard the hare by inserting small pieces of fat into the meat using a larding needle or wrap the hare with bacon or pancetta.
3. In a bowl, combine the grated bread, eggs, nutmeg, sugar, currants, salt, cinnamon, and cream. Mix well to form a pudding-like consistency.
4. Stuff the hare's belly with the bread mixture.
5. Secure the opening of the hare's belly with kitchen twine or skewers to prevent the stuffing from falling out during roasting.
6. Place the hare on a roasting rack in a roasting pan.
7. Roast the hare in the preheated oven for about 1.5 to 2 hours, or until the internal temperature reaches 70째C (160째F) for medium doneness.
8. Baste the hare with its own juices every 30 minutes to keep it moist.
9. Remove the hare from the oven and let it rest for 10-15 minutes before carving.
10. Serve the roasted hare with venison sauce or your choice of sauce.
