# Pickled "Mango" (Imitation)

## Description
This recipe is a modernized version of an 18th-century recipe for pickled "mango" that imitates the flavor of the original mango pickle. Instead of using mangoes, this recipe uses cucumbers as a substitute. The cucumbers are pickled in a mixture of white wine vinegar, garlic, mustard seeds, and ginger, resulting in a tangy and flavorful pickle.

## Options and commentary
- Instead of using cucumbers, you can also use green tomatoes or green papaya as a substitute for mangoes.
- Adjust the amount of ginger and garlic according to your taste preference.
- The pickles need to be stored in stone jars or any airtight container.

## Ingredients:
- 4 cucumbers (or green tomatoes/green papaya)
- 2 cloves of garlic, thinly sliced
- 1 tablespoon mustard seeds
- 1 tablespoon ginger, thinly sliced
- 500ml white wine vinegar
- 2 cloves of garlic, whole
- 1 tablespoon mustard seeds, whole

## Instructions:
1. Wash and dry the cucumbers. If using green tomatoes or green papaya, wash and slice them into desired shapes.
2. In a large pot, bring water to a boil and blanch the cucumbers (or other substitute) for 2 minutes. Drain and set aside.
3. In a separate pot, combine the white wine vinegar, sliced garlic, sliced ginger, and sliced mustard seeds. Bring the mixture to a boil.
4. Place the blanched cucumbers (or other substitute) in a sterilized stone jar or airtight container. Add the whole cloves of garlic and whole mustard seeds.
5. Pour the boiling hot vinegar mixture over the cucumbers, ensuring that they are completely covered.
6. Seal the jar tightly and let it cool to room temperature.
7. Store the pickles in a cool, dark place for at least two weeks, but preferably three weeks, allowing the flavors to develop.
8. Once opened, keep the pickles refrigerated and consume within a month.
