## Description
This recipe is for making homemade bacon from a young hog's leg and loin. The meat is cured with a mixture of salt-petre and brown sugar, then left to rest for several weeks before being hung up to dry. The end result is delicious, flavorful bacon that can be used in a variety of dishes.
