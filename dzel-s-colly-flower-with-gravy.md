# Dzel's Colly-flower with Gravy

## Description
This recipe is for a dish of cauliflower cooked in a flavorful gravy. The cauliflower is first boiled and then simmered in a cullis (a type of sauce) made from veal and bacon. The dish is finished with a butter and flour mixture, a touch of vinegar, and served hot.

## Options and commentary
- You can use vegetable broth instead of veal and bacon if you prefer a vegetarian version.
- Feel free to adjust the amount of vinegar to your taste.
- This dish can be served as a side dish or as a main course with some additional protein.

## Ingredients:
- 1 cauliflower
- 1 tablespoon butter
- 1 tablespoon flour
- Salt to taste
- 2-3 slices of bacon (or vegetable broth for a vegetarian version)
- 1 cup veal broth (or vegetable broth for a vegetarian version)
- A few drops of vinegar

## Instructions:
1. Fill a large pot halfway with water and bring it to a boil.
2. Add the butter, flour, salt, and bacon (or vegetable broth) to the pot.
3. Once the water is boiling, carefully add the cauliflower to the pot.
4. Boil the cauliflower until it is slightly more than halfway cooked. This should take about 5-7 minutes.
5. Remove the cauliflower from the pot and let it drain.
6. Place the cauliflower in a stewpan.
7. Pour the veal broth (or vegetable broth) over the cauliflower, just enough to cover it.
8. Place the stewpan over a gentle fire and let it simmer for about 10-15 minutes, or until the cauliflower is tender.
9. In a small bowl, knead together the butter and flour until well combined.
10. Break the butter and flour mixture into 5-6 small pieces and scatter them over the cauliflower in the stewpan.
11. Keep the stewpan moving over the fire until the butter is melted and the flour is cooked, creating a thickened gravy.
12. Add a few drops of vinegar to the stewpan and stir to incorporate.
13. Serve the colly-flowers hot in little dishes or plates.
