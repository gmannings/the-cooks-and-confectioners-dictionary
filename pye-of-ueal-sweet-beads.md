# Pye of Ueal Sweet-beads

## Description
This recipe is for a savory pie filled with sweetbreads, bacon, mushrooms or artichokes, and various fruits. The pie can be baked with a simple butter glaze or a mixture of white wine, butter, sugar, and egg yolks for added richness.

## Options and commentary
- Sweetbreads: Sweetbreads are the thymus or pancreas glands of young animals, usually veal or lamb. They have a delicate flavor and creamy texture. If you cannot find sweetbreads, you can substitute with chicken or turkey breast.
- Bacon: Use thinly sliced bacon or pancetta.
- Mushrooms or Artichokes: You can use either mushrooms or artichokes, or a combination of both, depending on your preference.
- Fruits: The original recipe suggests using gooseberries, barberries, grapes, or lemon slices. You can choose one or a combination of these fruits, or experiment with other fruits such as apples or pears.

## Ingredients:
- 500g sweetbreads (veal or lamb), parboiled and blanched
