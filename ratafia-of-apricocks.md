# Ratafia of Apricocks

## Description
Ratafia of Apricocks is a sweet liqueur made from apricots, brandy, and spices. It can be made by infusing apricots in brandy or by boiling them in white wine and adding brandy. The liqueur is then sweetened with sugar and flavored with apricot kernels, mace, cloves, and cinnamon. The mixture is left to infuse for several days before being strained and bottled.

## Options and commentary
- You can choose to either infuse the apricots in brandy or boil them in white wine before adding the brandy.
- The choice of method will affect the flavor profile of the liqueur. Infusing the apricots in brandy will result in a stronger apricot flavor, while boiling them in white wine will add a subtle wine undertone.
- The spices used can be adjusted according to personal preference. You can increase or decrease the amount of mace, cloves, and cinnamon to suit your taste.

## Ingredients:
- 1 kg apricots
- 1 liter brandy
- 500 ml white wine
- 250 g sugar
- Apricot kernels (from the apricots)
- 2 mace blades
- 4 cloves
- 1 cinnamon stick

## Instructions:
1. Option 1: Infusing method
   1. Cut the apricots into pieces and place them in a large glass jar or container.
   2. Pour the brandy over the apricots, making sure they are fully submerged.
   3. Seal the jar or container and let it sit at room temperature for 1-2 days to infuse.
   4. After the infusion period, strain the mixture through a fine-mesh straining bag or cheesecloth to remove the apricot solids.
   5. In a separate saucepan, combine the strained brandy with the sugar, apricot kernels, mace blades, cloves, and cinnamon stick.
   6. Heat the mixture over low heat, stirring until the sugar has dissolved.
   7. Remove from heat and let the mixture cool completely.
   8. Once cooled, strain the mixture again to remove any remaining solids.
   9. Transfer the liqueur to clean bottles and seal tightly. Store in a cool, dark place for at least 8-10 days before using.

2. Option 2: Boiling method
   1. Place the apricots in a large saucepan and pour the white wine over them.
   2. Add the brandy, sugar, apricot kernels, mace blades, cloves, and cinnamon stick to the saucepan.
   3. Bring the mixture to a gentle boil over medium heat.
   4. Reduce the heat to low and let the mixture simmer for about 20 minutes, until the apricots are soft.
   5. Remove from heat and let the mixture cool completely.
   6. Once cooled, strain the mixture through a fine-mesh straining bag or cheesecloth to remove the solids.
   7. Transfer the liqueur to clean bottles and seal tightly. Store in a cool, dark place for at least 8-10 days before using.
