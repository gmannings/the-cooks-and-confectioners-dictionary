# Fouced Brawn

## Description
Fouced Brawn is a traditional dish made from a young pig's head and other cuts of meat. The meat is first soaked, then boiled and finally preserved in a flavorful liquid. It is a rich and savory dish that can be enjoyed as a cold cut or used as an ingredient in other recipes.

## Options and commentary
- Instead of a whole pig's head, you can use a pork loin or shoulder for a smaller portion.
- The original recipe calls for soaking the meat in water for a night and a day. You can also use a brine solution for added flavor.
- The drink made of oatmeal and bran can be substituted with a mixture of vinegar, salt, and spices for a tangier flavor.

## Ingredients:
- 1 pork loin or shoulder
- Water, for soaking
- Brine solution (optional)
- 1 cup oatmeal
- 1 cup bran
- 4 cups water
- Vinegar, to taste
- Salt, to taste
- Spices (optional)

## Instructions:
1. If using a pork loin or shoulder, trim off any excess fat and bone the meat.
2. Cut the meat into fine collars, removing the side-bone and hind legs.
3. Make a brine solution by dissolving salt in water. Submerge the meat in the brine and let it soak overnight in the refrigerator (optional).
4. In a large pot, bring water to a boil. Add the soaked meat and continuously skim off any impurities that rise to the surface.
5. After the initial rapid boiling, reduce the heat and let the meat simmer gently overnight.
6. Remove the meat from the pot and place it into deep hoops or molds. Bind the meat tightly with tape to hold its shape.
7. Allow the meat to cool completely.
8. In a separate pot, combine oatmeal, bran, and water. Bring to a boil and simmer for about 30 minutes.
9. Strain the oatmeal and bran mixture through a sieve and let it cool.
10. Add vinegar, salt, and any desired spices to the strained liquid. Adjust the seasoning to taste.
11. Pour the liquid over the cooled meat, making sure it is completely submerged.
12. Seal the vessel tightly and store it in a cool place for future use.
