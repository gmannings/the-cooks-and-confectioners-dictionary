# Roasted Eel with Savory Seasoning and Oyster Sauce

## Description
This recipe is a modernized version of an 18th-century recipe for roasted eel. The eel is seasoned with a mixture of salt, pepper, nutmeg, and mace, along with onions, lemon peel, and thyme. It is then roasted on a spit until browned and crispy. The dish is served with a flavorful sauce made from the eel's gravy, onions, nutmeg, and minced oysters.

## Ingredients:
- 1 large eel
- Salt
- Pepper
- Nutmeg
- Mace
- 2-3 onions
- 1 piece of lemon peel
- Fresh thyme
- 2-3 eggs, yolks only
- Fresh sage leaves
- 1 cup oysters, minced
- Butter

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F).
2. Prepare the eel by stripping off the skin, removing the innards, and cleaning it thoroughly. Cut the eel into pieces about four inches long.
3. Pat the eel pieces dry with paper towels.
4. In a small bowl, mix together salt, pepper, nutmeg, and mace.
5. Finely chop the onions, lemon peel, and thyme.
6. Add the chopped onions, lemon peel, and thyme to the spice mixture and mix well.
7. Rub the seasoning mixture onto the eel pieces, ensuring they are well coated.
8. In a separate bowl, beat the egg yolks.
9. Dip each eel piece into the beaten egg yolks to coat them.
10. Skewer the eel pieces cross-ways onto a small spit, placing a sage leaf between each piece.
11. Place the spit with the eel over a roasting pan.
12. Roast the eel in the preheated oven for about 20-25 minutes, or until the eel is browned and crispy. Turn the eel pieces halfway through cooking to ensure even browning.
13. While the eel is roasting, prepare the sauce. In a saucepan, melt a knob of butter.
14. Add the eel's gravy (saved from the dish in which the eel was seasoned) to the saucepan.
15. Finely chop a large onion and add it to the saucepan.
16. Grate some nutmeg into the saucepan and add the minced oysters.
17. Cook the sauce over low heat, stirring occasionally, until the onions are softened and the oysters are cooked through.
18. Add a little drawn butter to the sauce and let it simmer for a few minutes.
19. Remove the roasted eel from the oven and transfer it to a serving dish.
20. Pour the prepared sauce over the eel.
21. Serve the roasted eel with the savory sauce.
