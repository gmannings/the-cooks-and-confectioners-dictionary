# Pickled Quinces

## Description
This recipe is for pickling quinces, a type of fruit that is tart and fragrant when cooked. The quinces are first soaked in a saltwater solution to remove any impurities, then boiled in a pickling liquid made with wine vinegar, spices, and bay leaves. The pickled quinces can be used in various dishes, such as tarts or served as a condiment.

## Ingredients:
- 4 quinces
- Water
- Salt
- 500 ml wine vinegar
- 2 bay leaves
- 1 teaspoon whole mace
- 1 teaspoon whole cloves

## Instructions:
1. Wash the quinces in water and salt to remove any dirt or impurities. Rub off the scurf (a rough coating) from the quinces.
2. Place the quinces in a bowl of water and salt and let them soak for 24 hours.
3. In a large pot, combine the wine vinegar, bay leaves, whole mace, and whole cloves. Bring the mixture to a boil and let it simmer for 10 minutes.
4. Remove the quinces from the saltwater solution and place them in the pot with the pickling liquid. Parboil the quinces in the pickling liquid for about 5 minutes.
5. Using a slotted spoon, transfer the quinces and the pickling liquid into an earthenware or glass pan.
6. Allow the pickled quinces to cool completely before covering the pan.
7. Store the pickled quinces in the refrigerator for at least 1 week before using. The longer they sit, the more flavorful they will become.
