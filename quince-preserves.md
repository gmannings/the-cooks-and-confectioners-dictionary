# Quince Preserves

## Description
This recipe is for making quince preserves, a sweet and tangy fruit preserve that can be enjoyed on its own or used as a topping for toast, pastries, or yogurt.

## Options and commentary
- You can adjust the sweetness of the preserves by adding more or less sugar according to your taste.
- If you prefer a smoother texture, you can puree the cooked quinces before adding them back to the syrup.

## Ingredients:
- 4 large quinces
- 1 liter water
- 500 grams sugar
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 250 ml stale beer

## Instructions:
1. Wash the quinces and remove any blemishes or dirt.
2. Cut the quinces into quarters and remove the cores.
3. In a large pot, add the quince pieces and cover with water.
4. Bring the water to a boil and let the quinces cook until they are soft and easily pierced with a fork. This will take about 20-30 minutes.
5. Once the quinces are cooked, strain the liquid into a separate bowl and set aside.
6. Place the cooked quinces back into the pot and add the sugar, salt, and stale beer.
7. Pour the reserved quince liquid back into the pot with the quinces.
8. Stir well to combine all the ingredients.
9. Cover the pot and let the quinces simmer on low heat for about 1 hour, or until the syrup has thickened and the quinces have absorbed the flavors.
10. Remove from heat and let the quince preserves cool completely.
11. Transfer the preserves to sterilized jars and seal tightly.
12. Store in a cool, dark place for up to 1 year.
