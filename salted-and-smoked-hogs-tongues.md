# Salted and Smoked Hogs Tongues

## Description
This recipe is for salting and smoking hogs tongues to preserve them and add flavor. The tongues are first scalded to remove the outer skin, then dried and salted with a mixture of herbs and spices. They are then wrapped in pieces of hogs skirts, tied, and hung to smoke for a few weeks until they are thoroughly dry. The tongues can be boiled and served whole or sliced.

- Hogs tongues
- Juniper berries
- Thyme
- Sweet basil
- Fine herbs (except sage)

13. Wrap each tongue in a piece of hogs skirt and tie them up at both ends.
14. Tie two tongues together using the strings at one end.
15. Hang the tied tongues on a pole over a chimney, making sure they do not touch each other.
