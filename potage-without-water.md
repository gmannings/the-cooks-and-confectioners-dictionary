# Potage without Water

## Description
Potage without Water is a rich and flavorful soup made with a combination of meats and poultry, vegetables, and herbs. The dish is slow-cooked in a pot, sealed with paper and pastry to retain all the steam and flavors. The resulting soup is then served with a garnished loaf and a ragout of fried garnitures.

## Ingredients:
- 1 kg beef (preferably a tender cut)
- 500g mutton
- 500g veal fillet
- 1 capon (or chicken)
- 2 partridges
- 4 pigeons
- 2 parsnips, shredded
- 2 onions, shredded
- 2 parsley roots, shredded
- Salt to taste
- Assorted sweet herbs (such as thyme, rosemary, and bay leaves)
- 1 loaf of bread
- Garnitures (such as cooked cockscombs, veal sweetbreads, or other similar ingredients)
- Lard for frying

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F).
2. In a large pot, combine the beef, mutton, veal fillet, capon, partridges, and pigeons. Make sure the meats are well beaten and the fowls are trussed.
3. Add the shredded parsnips, onions, and parsley roots to the pot.
4. Season the mixture with salt and the assorted sweet herbs.
5. Seal the edges of the pot with a layer of paper and pastry, ensuring that all the steam is trapped inside and no air can escape or enter.
6. Place the pot into a larger kettle filled with hot water. Use hay or a similar material to keep the pot upright and steady.
7. Keep the kettle boiling continuously for 6 to 8 hours.
8. After the cooking time, uncover the pot and carefully pour off all the gravy from the meat. Remove any excess fat from the gravy.
9. Take out the fowls from the pot and mince them. Use the minced fowls to stuff a loaf of bread, creating a garnished loaf.
10. Soak both the garnished loaf and the soup in the reserved gravy.
11. In a separate pan, fry the garnitures in lard until golden and crispy.
12. Pour the fried garnitures over the soaked garnished loaf and soup.
13. Finally, decorate the dish with cooked cockscombs, veal sweetbreads, or any other desired garnishes.
14. Serve the Potage without Water hot and enjoy!
