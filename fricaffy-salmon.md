# Fricaffy Salmon

## Description
Fricaffy Salmon is a dish made with pieces of fresh salmon that are seasoned, fried, and then served with a flavorful sauce. The salmon is cut into finger-sized pieces and seasoned with a mixture of herbs and spices. It is then fried until golden brown and served on sippets (toasted bread) with a sauce made from white wine, oysters, onions, anchovies, and eggs.

## Ingredients:
- 1 salmon fillet (about 500g)
- Salt
- 1/2 teaspoon ground mace
- 1/2 teaspoon ground cloves
- 1/2 teaspoon ground ginger
- 1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg
- 6 egg yolks
- Clarified butter or oil, for frying
- 200ml white wine
- 12 large oysters
- 1 large onion, finely chopped
- 2 anchovies, finely chopped
- 1 teaspoon minced thyme
- 1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg
- 4 egg yolks
- 50g butter, melted
- Sippets (toasted bread), for serving

## Instructions:
1. Cut the salmon fillet into pieces that are the length and thickness of your finger.
2. In a bowl, mix together the minced herbs (sweet herbs, parsley, and fennel), salt, mace, cloves, ginger, nutmeg, and 6 egg yolks.
3. Heat the clarified butter or oil in a pan until very hot.
4. Quickly scatter the seasoned salmon pieces into the hot pan, taking care not to let them clump together. Fry until they are about three-quarters cooked.
5. Pour out the fat from the pan and replace it with white wine, oysters (with their liquor), chopped onion, anchovies, minced thyme, and ground nutmeg.
6. In a separate bowl, beat together 4 egg yolks with some of the oyster liquor.
7. Pour the beaten egg yolks into the pan with the salmon and sauce. Cook until the sauce thickens slightly.
8. To serve, place the fricaffy salmon on sippets (toasted bread) and pour the sauce over the top. Drizzle with melted butter and garnish with oysters.
9. Serve immediately.
