# Royal Cider

## Description
Royal Cider is a fortified cider drink that combines the flavors of cider, brandy, and cider-sweets. It is a rich and flavorful beverage with a hint of sweetness and a warming kick from the brandy.

## Ingredients:
- 1 gallon (3.8 liters) of fine cider
- 1.5 pints (710 ml) of brandy or spirits distilled from cider
- 1 quart (946 ml) of cider-sweets

## Instructions:
1. Ensure that the cider is fine and has completed its fermentations, but is not very stale.
2. In a separate container, mix together the brandy (or spirits) and the cider-sweets.
3. Add an equal quantity of cider to the brandy and cider-sweets mixture.
4. Stir the mixture well with a stick at the bung-hole of the cider cask for a quarter of an hour.
5. Close the bung-hole tightly.
6. Roll the cask about ten or twelve times to mix the ingredients thoroughly.
7. Set the cask aside for three or four months to allow the flavors to meld and mature.
8. After the aging period, the Royal Cider can be bottled or enjoyed directly from the cask.
