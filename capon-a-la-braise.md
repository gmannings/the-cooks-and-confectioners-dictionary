# Capon a la Braise

## Description
Capon a la Braise is a classic French dish that features a tender and flavorful capon (a castrated rooster) cooked in a rich and aromatic braising liquid. The capon is first larded with seasoned lardons, then braised with a mixture of bacon, beef, veal, vegetables, herbs, spices, and lemon slices. The dish is finished with a delicious ragout made with various ingredients like fat, livers, sweetbreads, mushrooms, truffles, asparagus tops, or artichoke bottoms. The capon is then served with the ragout poured over it.
