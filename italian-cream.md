# Italian Cream

## Description
Italian Cream is a rich and creamy dessert made with milk, eggs, sugar, and cinnamon. It has a smooth and velvety texture and is served chilled. This dessert is perfect for special occasions or as a sweet treat after a meal.

## Options and commentary
- You can add a splash of vanilla extract for extra flavor.
- For a lighter version, you can use low-fat milk instead of whole milk.
- You can also garnish the cream with a sprinkle of ground cinnamon or grated chocolate before serving.

## Ingredients:
- 2 liters of milk
- 200 grams of sugar
- A pinch of salt
- 1 cinnamon stick
- 10 egg yolks
- 100 ml of cream (optional)

## Instructions:
1. In a large saucepan, combine the milk, sugar, salt, and cinnamon stick. Place the saucepan over medium heat and bring the mixture to a boil, stirring occasionally to dissolve the sugar.
2. In a separate large dish, place a sieve. Crack the egg yolks into the sieve.
3. Once the milk mixture has come to a boil, remove the cinnamon stick and carefully pour the hot milk mixture through the sieve into the dish with the egg yolks. This will strain out any lumps or impurities.
4. Repeat the process of pouring the milk mixture through the sieve into the dish with the egg yolks three or four times. This will ensure a smooth and creamy texture.
5. Optional: If using cream, pour it into the dish with the strained milk and egg mixture and stir to combine.
6. Place the dish with the cream mixture into a baking dish or pan. Fill the baking dish with water until it reaches about halfway up the sides of the dish with the cream mixture. This will create a water bath.
7. Preheat your oven to 180°C (350°F).
8. Carefully place the baking dish with the cream mixture and water bath into the preheated oven. Bake for about 45-60 minutes, or until the cream becomes very thick and set.
9. Once the cream is thickened, remove it from the oven and let it cool to room temperature. Then, transfer it to the refrigerator and chill for at least 2 hours, or until completely cold.
10. Serve the Italian Cream chilled in individual dessert bowls or glasses. Optionally, garnish with a sprinkle of ground cinnamon or grated chocolate.
