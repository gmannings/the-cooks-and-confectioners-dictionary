# Sack Cream

## Description
Sack Cream is a rich and creamy dessert that was popular in the 18th century. It is made by boiling cream and adding a sweet fortified wine called Sack, along with nutmeg and sugar. The result is a deliciously flavored cream that can be enjoyed on its own or used as a topping for other desserts.

## Ingredients:
- 1 liter of cream
- 6 tablespoons of Sack (fortified wine)
- 1/2 teaspoon of ground nutmeg
- 4 tablespoons of sugar

## Instructions:
1. In a large saucepan, heat the cream over medium heat until it comes to a gentle boil.
2. Reduce the heat to low and add the Sack to the cream, stirring continuously to prevent curdling.
3. Continue stirring for about 5 minutes to ensure the Sack is well incorporated into the cream.
4. Add the ground nutmeg and sugar to the cream mixture and stir until the sugar is dissolved.
5. Remove the saucepan from the heat and let the Sack Cream cool to room temperature.
6. Once cooled, transfer the Sack Cream to a container and refrigerate for at least 2 hours to allow it to set and chill.
7. Serve the Sack Cream chilled, either on its own or as a topping for desserts like fruit pies or puddings.
