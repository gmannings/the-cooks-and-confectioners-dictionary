# Dzels Calves Feet

## Description
Dzels Calves Feet is a traditional dish made with boiled calves feet, beef, veal, and bread. The broth is flavored with salt, mace, and nutmeg, and then thickened with boiled rice. The dish is typically served with a boiled chicken in the center and sippets (small pieces of toasted bread) on the side.

## Options and commentary
- You can use chicken broth instead of water to boil the calves feet, beef, and veal for added flavor.
- If you prefer a vegetarian version, you can omit the meat and use vegetable broth instead.
- You can add additional spices and herbs, such as bay leaves, thyme, or parsley, to enhance the flavor of the broth.
- Sippets can be replaced with croutons or served with bread on the side.

## Ingredients:
- 4 calves feet
- 200g beef

5. Once the meat is cooked, remove it from the pot and strain the broth to remove any bones, skins, and other solids. Set the broth aside.
