# Syrup of Barberries

## Description
This recipe is for making a sweet and tangy syrup using barberries. The syrup can be used as a topping for desserts, pancakes, or added to cocktails for a unique flavor.

## Ingredients:
- 500g barberries
- 500g fine sugar

## Instructions:
1. Pick the barberries, removing any stems or leaves.
2. Place the barberries in a pot and add enough water to cover them.
3. Bring the water to a boil and cook the barberries until they become soft and pulpy.
4. Strain the cooked barberries through a fine mesh strainer to remove any seeds or solids.
5. Clarify the juice by pouring it through a cheesecloth-lined strainer or using a jelly bag.
6. In a clean pot, combine the clarified barberry juice and the fine sugar.
7. Bring the mixture to a boil, stirring constantly to dissolve the sugar.
8. Continue boiling the mixture until it reaches a syrup consistency. If the syrup is not thick enough, you can add more sugar and continue boiling until desired thickness is achieved.
