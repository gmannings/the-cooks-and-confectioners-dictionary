## Description
This recipe is for a unique and visually appealing dessert consisting of puddings of different colors. Each pudding is made with a combination of ingredients and flavored with different flowers, resulting in a variety of flavors and colors. The puddings are then boiled, served together, and garnished with a sweet and tangy sauce.

## Options and commentary

- 1 pint (473 ml) cream
- 1 pound (454 g) blanched almonds
- Rose water
- 1/4 pound (113 g) dates, sliced

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 350°F (180°C).
2. Butter the inside of six individual pudding dishes with covers.
3. Prepare the quaking pudding mixture: Slice the manchet and scald it with the cream in a saucepan. Add the pounded almonds with rose water, sliced dates, currants, and minced marrow. Mix well and season with salt, nutmeg, and sugar. Stir in the egg yolks.
4. Fill one of the pudding dishes with the quaking pudding mixture. Cover it and tie it securely with a cloth.
5. Color another portion of the pudding mixture with spinach. Fill another pudding dish with the spinach-colored mixture, cover, and tie.
6. Mince cowslips and mix them with another portion of the pudding mixture. Fill a third pudding dish with the cowslip mixture, cover, and tie.
7. Mince clove flowers and mix them with another portion of the pudding mixture. Fill a fourth pudding dish with the clove flower mixture, cover, and tie.
8. Mince violets and pound them in a mortar. Mix the violet juice with the remaining pudding mixture. Fill the fifth pudding dish with the violet mixture, cover, and tie.
9. Place all the pudding dishes in a large pot or steamer. Fill the pot with enough water to reach halfway up the sides of the dishes.
10. Bring the water to a boil and then reduce the heat to a simmer. Steam the puddings for about 1 hour or until set.
11. Remove the puddings from the dishes and arrange them in a large serving dish.
12. Stick the puddings with suckets (candied fruit peel).
13. In a small saucepan, melt some butter and add vinegar, rose water, and sugar to taste. Heat until the sugar is dissolved.
14. Pour the sauce over the puddings and sprinkle with scraped sugar.
