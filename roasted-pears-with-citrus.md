# Roasted Pears with Citrus

## Description
This recipe is a modern take on roasted pears, a classic dish from the 18th century. The pears are roasted until they turn red and are then dressed with a citrus juice, which adds a refreshing and tangy flavor to the dish. This is a simple and elegant dessert that can be enjoyed on its own or served with a dollop of whipped cream or a scoop of vanilla ice cream.

## Ingredients:
- 4 pears
- 1/4 cup sugar
- 1/4 cup water
- Juice of 1 orange or lemon

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C).
2. Wash the pears and pat them dry.
3. Cut off the top of each pear and use a melon baller or a small spoon to remove the cores.
4. Place the pears in a baking dish, cut side up.
5. In a small bowl, mix together the sugar and water until the sugar is dissolved.
6. Pour the sugar mixture over the pears, making sure to coat them evenly.
7. Place the baking dish in the preheated oven and roast the pears for about 30-40 minutes, or until they turn red and become tender.
8. While the pears are roasting, squeeze the juice of an orange or lemon into a separate bowl.
9. Once the pears are done roasting, remove them from the oven and let them cool slightly.
10. Transfer the roasted pears to a serving dish and drizzle them with the citrus juice.
11. Serve the roasted pears warm or at room temperature.
