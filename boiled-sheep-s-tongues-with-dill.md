# Boiled Sheep's Tongues with Dill

## Description
This recipe is for boiled sheep's tongues served with a flavorful sauce made with cyfters (a type of broth), red wine, and spices. The dish is garnished with parsley, barberries, and oysters, and served on sippets (small pieces of toasted bread).

## Ingredients:
- 6 sheep's tongues
- Water
- Salt
- 1 quart of broth (such as chicken or vegetable broth)
- 1/4 cup red wine
- Assorted whole spices (such as cloves, peppercorns, and bay leaves)
- 2 tablespoons butter
- 3 egg yolks
- Sippets (small pieces of toasted bread)
- Fresh parsley, for garnish
- Barberries, for garnish
- Oysters, for garnish

## Instructions:
1. In a large pot, bring water and salt to a boil. Add the sheep's tongues and cook until tender, about 1-2 hours.
2. Once the tongues are tender, remove them from the pot and allow them to cool slightly. Peel off the skin and cut the tongues into thin slices.
3. In a stew-pan, combine the sliced tongues, broth, red wine, and whole spices. Bring the mixture to a simmer and let it stew for about 30 minutes to allow the flavors to meld together.
4. In a small bowl, beat the egg yolks until well combined.
5. Gradually add the beaten egg yolks to the stew-pan, stirring constantly to prevent curdling. Cook for an additional 5 minutes to thicken the sauce.
6. Stir in the butter until melted and well incorporated.
7. To serve, place sippets on a serving platter. Spoon the stewed sheep's tongues and sauce over the sippets.
8. Garnish with fresh parsley, barberries, and oysters.
9. Serve the dish immediately.

## Cooking time
Approximately 2-3 hours (including boiling the tongues)
