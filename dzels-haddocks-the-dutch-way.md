# Dzels Haddocks the Dutch Way

## Description
This recipe is for preparing haddocks in the Dutch style. The haddocks are first cleaned and then scored on both sides. They are then boiled in a mixture of water, salt, and vinegar until they are cooked through. The haddocks are served with a sauce made from boiled turnips, mixed with drawn butter and minced parsley. The dish is garnished with minced parsley and served with sippets (small pieces of toasted bread) at the bottom of the dish.

## Options and commentary
- Instead of haddocks, you can use any white fish fillets such as cod or haddock.
- If you prefer a different vegetable, you can substitute turnips with carrots or parsnips.
- You can adjust the amount of drawn butter and minced parsley in the sauce according to your taste.
- Sippets can be made by toasting small pieces of bread until crispy.

## Ingredients:
- 2 haddocks (or any white fish fillets)
- 2 turnips
- Water
- Salt
- Vinegar
- 50g butter
- 2 tablespoons minced parsley
- Sippets (small pieces of toasted bread)

## Instructions:
1. Start by cleaning the haddocks. Scale and gut them, and then score the flesh on both sides with a knife, making shallow cuts along the backbone.
2. Place the haddocks in a bowl of cold water and let them soak for an hour. This will help remove any excess blood and firm up the flesh.
3. In a large pot, bring water, salt, and vinegar to a boil. The amount of water should be enough to fully submerge the haddocks.
4. Carefully place the haddocks into the boiling water and let them cook until the flesh easily separates from the backbone. This will take about 10-15 minutes, depending on the thickness of the fish.
5. While the haddocks are cooking, prepare the sauce. Peel and cut the turnips into small pieces, about the size of yolks of eggs.
6. In a separate pot, bring water and salt to a boil. Add the turnips and cook until they are very tender.
7. Drain the cooked turnips and return them to the pot. Add the butter and minced parsley to the turnips and stir until the butter is melted and the ingredients are well combined.
8. Toast small pieces of bread until crispy to make sippets.
9. To serve, place the sippets at the bottom of a serving dish. Carefully transfer the cooked haddocks onto the sippets.
10. Pour the turnips and sauce over the haddocks, making sure to cover them completely.
11. Sprinkle minced parsley around the dish for garnish.
12. Serve the dzels haddocks the Dutch way immediately.
