# Musk Sugar

## Description
Musk Sugar is a perfumed sugar that can be used to add a unique fragrance to desserts and sweet treats.

## Ingredients:
- 3-4 grains of musk
- Fine sugar

## Instructions:
1. Take three or four grains of musk and crush them into a powder.
2. Place the crushed musk into a small piece of lawn or cambric rag.
3. Place the musk-filled rag at the bottom of an earthen pot.
4. Sprinkle a layer of fine sugar over the musk in the pot.
5. Close the pot tightly to prevent any air from getting in.
6. Set the pot in a warm place.
7. Allow the sugar to sit for a few days, allowing the musk to infuse its fragrance into the sugar.
8. After a few days, the sugar will be well perfumed with the scent of musk.

## Cooking time
Approximately a few days for the sugar to absorb the fragrance of the musk.
