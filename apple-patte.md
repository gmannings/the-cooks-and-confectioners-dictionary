# Apple Patte

## Description
Apple Patte is a sweet fruit paste made from apples and sugar. It is a delicious and versatile treat that can be enjoyed on its own or used as a filling for pastries and desserts.

## Options and commentary
- You can use any variety of apples for this recipe, but sweeter apples like Gala or Fuji work well.
- If you prefer a smoother texture, you can peel the apples before cooking them.
- The traditional method of drying the paste in a stove can be time-consuming. Alternatively, you can spread the paste on a baking sheet and dry it in a low-temperature oven until it is firm and no longer sticky.

## Ingredients:
- 1 kg apples
- 1 kg sugar

## Instructions:
1. Peel and core the apples. Cut them into small pieces.
2. Place the apple pieces in a large saucepan and add enough water to cover them.
3. Bring the water to a boil and let the apples cook until they are soft and easily mashed with a fork.
4. Drain the cooked apples and pass them through a sieve to remove any lumps or skins.
5. Return the sieved apples to the saucepan and place it over low heat.
6. Stir the apples continuously with a spatula to prevent them from burning. Make sure to scrape the bottom and sides of the pan to avoid sticking.
7. Cook the apples until the paste starts to pull away from the bottom and sides of the pan.
8. Remove the pan from the heat and add the sugar to the cooked apples. Mix well until the sugar is fully incorporated.
9. Place the pan back on the heat and simmer the mixture over low heat, stirring constantly, until it thickens and reaches a paste-like consistency.
10. Prepare either molds or slates by greasing them lightly with oil or lining them with parchment paper.
11. Pour the hot apple paste into the molds or spread it evenly onto the prepared slates.
12. Place the molds or slates in a warm, dry place, such as a low-temperature oven or a food dehydrator, to dry. Leave them undisturbed until the paste is firm and no longer sticky.
13. Once the apple paste is completely dry, remove it from the molds or slates and store it in an airtight container.

## Cooking time
- Cooking the apples: approximately 20 minutes
- Drying the paste: 6-8 hours or until firm and no longer sticky
