# Quince Cream

## Description
Quince Cream is a sweet and creamy dessert made with roasted quinces, cream, ginger, sugar, and rosewater. It has a delicate and fragrant flavor that is perfect for a light and refreshing dessert.

## Ingredients:
- 4-5 ripe quinces
- 1 pint (473 ml) sweet cream
- 1 piece of ginger
- Sugar, to taste
- Rosewater, to taste

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 350°F (180°C).
2. Wash the quinces and remove any dirt or blemishes.
3. Cut the quinces in half and remove the cores.
4. Slice the quinces thinly.
5. Place the sliced quinces on a baking sheet and roast them in the preheated oven for about 30-40 minutes, or until they are soft and slightly caramelized.
6. In a saucepan, combine the roasted quinces, sweet cream, and the piece of ginger.
7. Place the saucepan over a gentle fire or low heat and simmer the mixture until it thickens to a creamy consistency. This may take about 20-30 minutes.
8. Remove the piece of ginger from the mixture.
9. Strain the mixture through a fine-mesh sieve to remove any solids.
10. Add sugar and rosewater to taste, stirring well to combine.
11. Allow the quince cream to cool to room temperature.

13. Refrigerate for at least 2 hours, or until chilled and set.
14. Serve the quince cream chilled, garnished with a sprinkle of sugar or a drizzle of rosewater, if desired.
