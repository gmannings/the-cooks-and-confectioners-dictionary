# Potage the French Way

## Description
Potage the French Way is a traditional French soup made with a combination of lettuce, sorrel, and chervil. The herbs are cooked down with butter and then simmered with water, cloves, and bread. The soup is thickened with beaten egg yolks and served over thin slices of white bread.

## Ingredients:
- Hard lettuce
- Sorrel
- Chervil
- 1 pound (450g) fresh butter
- Water
- Salt
- Whole cloves
- Crust of bread
- 2 egg yolks

## Instructions:
1. Take a half peck (approximately 5 liters) of hard lettuce, sorrel, and chervil. Alternatively, you can use any other herbs of your choice. Pick the herbs, wash them thoroughly, and drain them.
2. In a large pot, melt the fresh butter over medium heat.
3. Add the herbs to the pot and stir them down in the melted butter until they are all coated.
4. Pour in enough water to cover the herbs. Add a little salt and a few whole cloves.
5. Place a crust of bread in the pot and bring the mixture to a boil.
6. Once the soup is boiling, remove the crust of bread.
7. In a separate bowl, beat the egg yolks until well combined.
