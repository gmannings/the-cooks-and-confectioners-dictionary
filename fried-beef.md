# Fried Beef

## Description
This recipe is for frying beef steaks in a pan with butter and creating a flavorful gravy with the drippings. The beef is seasoned with anchovy, onion, nutmeg, pepper, and claret (red wine) to enhance the taste.

## Ingredients:
- 500g beef steak (such as sirloin or ribeye)
- 2 tablespoons butter
- 1 anchovy fillet, finely chopped
- 1 small onion, finely chopped
- 1/4 teaspoon nutmeg
- 1/4 teaspoon black pepper
- 100ml red wine (claret)

## Instructions:
1. Cut the beef steak into individual steaks, about 1.5cm thick.
2. Using the back of a knife, gently pound the steaks to tenderize them.
3. In a frying pan, melt the butter over medium heat.
4. Add the lean parts of the beef steaks to the pan. Cook the steaks, turning them often, until they are browned on both sides. 
5. As the beef cooks, pour out any excess fat or liquid that accumulates in the pan.
6. Remove the cooked lean steaks from the pan and set them aside.
7. Add the remaining fat from the beef to the pan and fry it until crispy.
8. Place the crispy fat on top of the cooked lean steaks.
9. In the same pan, add the chopped anchovy, onion, nutmeg, black pepper, and red wine (claret) to the drippings. 
10. Stir the mixture and let it simmer for a few minutes to combine the flavors and reduce slightly.
11. Pour the gravy over the fried beef steaks.
12. Serve the fried beef steaks with the flavorful gravy.
