# Boiled Spinach

## Description
This recipe provides instructions for boiling spinach until it is soft and tender. The spinach is cooked in its own juice, without the addition of any extra liquid. Alternatively, you can use a tin-box that seals tightly to prevent any liquid from entering, and boil the spinach in a kettle of water or in a pot with beef.

## Ingredients:
- Spinach

## Instructions:
1. Wash the spinach thoroughly to remove any dirt or debris.
2. Drain the spinach to remove excess water.
3. Place the spinach in a pot or pipkin.
4. If using a pot, place the pot into a kettle of water. If using a tin-box, ensure it is tightly sealed.
5. Bring the water in the kettle to a boil and let the spinach cook until it becomes soft and tender. This should take approximately 5-7 minutes.
6. If using a pot, you can also add beef or other ingredients to the pot along with the spinach to enhance the flavor. Cook until the spinach is soft and tender.
7. Once the spinach is cooked, remove it from the heat.

## Cooking time
