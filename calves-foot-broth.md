## Description
Calves-foot-broth is a rich and flavorful broth made from boiling calves' feet. It was a popular dish in the 18th century and was often served as a nourishing and comforting soup.

## Ingredients:
- 2 calves' feet
- Water
- 2-3 blades of mace
- 120 ml sack (fortified wine)
- 500 ml broth (such as beef or chicken)

- 2 egg yolks
- Salt, to taste
- Sugar, to taste
- 30 g butter
- Juice and peel of 1 fresh lemon

2. Bring the water to a boil and let the feet simmer for several hours until the broth becomes gelatinous.
3. Strain the broth to remove any solids and return the liquid to the pot.
4. Add the blades of mace to the broth and place it back on the fire.
5. Pour in the sack (fortified wine) and the broth.
6. Add the currants to the pot and let them plump up.

9. Season the broth with salt and sweeten it with sugar to your taste.
