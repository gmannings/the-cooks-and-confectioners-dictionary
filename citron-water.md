# Citron Water

## Description
Citron Water is a refreshing and fragrant drink made from the rinds of citrons. It has a citrusy flavor with a hint of sweetness. This recipe involves infusing the citron rinds in Sack (a type of fortified wine) and then distilling it to create a concentrated essence. The essence is then mixed with sugar candy and Ambergreefe (a fragrant substance) to enhance the flavor. The final product can be enjoyed on its own or used as a flavoring in various cocktails and desserts.

## Ingredients:
- Rinds of 2 citrons
- 500 ml Sack (fortified wine)
- Sugar candy (to taste)
- Ambergreefe (to taste)

## Instructions:
1. Peel off the rinds of the citrons, making sure they are about half a finger thick. Slice the rinds thinly.
2. Place the sliced citron rinds and the kernels into a stone jug.
3. Pour enough Sack into the jug to cover the citron rinds and kernels.
4. Seal the jug tightly and place it in a cool cellar for five days to allow the flavors to infuse.
5. After five days, distill the contents of the jug using a glass distillation apparatus. Collect the distilled liquid in a glass bottle.
6. Finely pound some sugar candy and add it to the bottle of distilled citron essence. The amount of sugar candy can be adjusted according to taste.
7. Add a small amount of Ambergreefe to the bottle. The amount can be adjusted according to preference.
8. Mix the contents of the bottle well to ensure that the sugar candy and Ambergreefe are evenly distributed.
9. The citron water is now ready to be enjoyed. It can be used as a flavoring in cocktails or desserts, or simply enjoyed on its own.
