# Veal Cutlets with Mutton Gravy and Claret Sauce

## Description
This recipe is for a delicious and flavorful dish of veal cutlets served with a rich mutton gravy and a tangy claret sauce. The veal cutlets are seasoned with salt, fried in butter, and then topped with the flavorful sauce. The dish is garnished with sliced lemon for a refreshing touch.

## Ingredients:
- 1 leg of veal, bone removed and cut into thin slices
- Salt
- Lard (approximately 2 cm long pieces)
- Fresh butter
- Mutton gravy
- Claret (red wine)
- 1 anchovy
- Juice of 1 orange
- 1 clove of garlic
- Sliced lemon (for garnish)

## Instructions:
1. Take the leg of veal and remove the bone. Cut it into thin slices.
2. Using the back of a cleaver, gently beat the veal slices to tenderize them.
3. Season the veal slices with salt on both sides.
4. Take the lard pieces and insert them into each veal slice, making sure they are evenly distributed.
5. In a frying pan, melt a generous amount of fresh butter over medium heat.

7. While the veal is frying, prepare the sauce. In a separate saucepan, combine mutton gravy, claret, the anchovy, and the juice of an orange. Place the saucepan over low heat and let the sauce simmer gently.
8. Take a clove of garlic and rub it all over the serving dish to infuse it with a subtle garlic flavor.
