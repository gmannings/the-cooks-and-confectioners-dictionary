# Baked Udder

## Description
Baked Udder is a traditional dish made with a young udder that is seasoned with spices, wrapped in veal-caul, and baked in a pie. The udder is first boiled until tender, then cooled before being wrapped in veal-caul and placed in a pie with layers of seasoned veal, lard, and butter. The pie is then baked and brushed with clarified butter.

## Ingredients:
- 1 young udder
- Large lardons (thick strips of bacon)
- Pepper
- Nutmeg
- Cloves
- Mace
- Salt
- Veal-caul (thin membrane that surrounds the internal organs of a calf)
- Slices of veal
- Butter
- Clarified butter (for brushing)

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F).

2. In a large pot, place the young udder and cover it with water. Add the large lardons, pepper, nutmeg, cloves, and mace to the pot. Bring the water to a boil and then reduce the heat to a simmer. Cook the udder until it is tender, which may take about 2-3 hours.

3. Once the udder is tender, remove it from the pot and let it cool completely.

4. While the udder is cooling, prepare the veal-caul by rinsing it under cold water and patting it dry. Season it with salt, pepper, nutmeg, cloves, and mace.

5. Line the bottom of a pie dish with slices of veal, seasoning them with salt, pepper, nutmeg, cloves, and mace.

6. Place the cooled udder on top of the seasoned veal slices.

7. Layer slices of veal on top of the udder, seasoning each layer with salt, pepper, nutmeg, cloves, and mace.

8. Add slices of lard and butter on top of the veal layers.

9. Cover the pie dish with the seasoned veal-caul, making sure to wrap it tightly around the udder and other ingredients.

10. Close up the pie by sealing the edges of the veal-caul together.

11. Place the pie dish in the preheated oven and bake for about 1 hour, or until the pie crust is golden brown and the filling is heated through.

12. Remove the pie from the oven and brush the top with clarified butter to give it a glossy finish.

13. Let the pie cool for a few minutes before serving.

## Cooking time
Approximately 3-4 hours (including boiling the udder) and 1 hour of baking.
