# Court Fritters

## Description
Court Fritters are a traditional 18th-century dish made with curdled milk, eggs, flour, sugar, and clarified beef suet. These fritters are a sweet treat that can be served as a side dish or a dessert.

## Options and commentary
- Instead of warm milk from the cow, you can use regular milk or any non-dairy milk alternative.
- Sack refers to a type of fortified wine. You can substitute it with sherry or any other sweet wine.
- Clarified beef suet can be replaced with vegetable shortening or butter for a vegetarian option.

## Ingredients:
- 500 ml warm milk
- 100 ml fortified wine (such as sherry)
- 6-8 eggs
- 200 g all-purpose flour
- 50 g sugar
- 100 g clarified beef suet (or vegetable shortening/butter)

## Instructions:
1. In a large bowl, combine the warm milk and fortified wine.
2. Allow the mixture to sit for a few minutes until the milk curdles. This will create the curd needed for the fritters.
3. Using a fine-mesh sieve or cheesecloth, strain the curdled milk to separate the curds from the whey. Discard the whey.
4. Transfer the curds to a separate bowl and add the eggs.
5. Using a whisk, beat the curds and eggs together until well combined.
6. Gradually add the flour to the curd and egg mixture, whisking continuously to form a smooth batter.
7. Stir in the sugar until evenly distributed throughout the batter.
8. In a separate saucepan, melt the clarified beef suet (or vegetable shortening/butter) over medium heat until fully liquid.
9. Once the suet is melted, carefully pour it into the batter mixture, stirring constantly to incorporate it.
10. Heat a large frying pan or skillet over medium heat and add a small amount of the melted suet or oil to grease the pan.
11. Spoon small portions of the batter into the pan, creating fritters of desired size.
12. Cook the fritters for 2-3 minutes on each side, or until golden brown and cooked through.
13. Remove the fritters from the pan and place them on a paper towel-lined plate to absorb any excess oil.
14. Serve the Court Fritters as a side dish or dessert.
