# Marinades

## Description
Marinades are sauces or pickles in which certain ingredients are steeped to enhance their flavor and make them more enjoyable to eat. They can be used to make dishes or to garnish other dishes. For example, a fricassee of chickens is often garnished with marinated chickens, and a roasted loin or stuffed breast of veal can be garnished with a veal marinade. Marinades for pigeons, partridges, and other meats can be found in their respective recipes.
