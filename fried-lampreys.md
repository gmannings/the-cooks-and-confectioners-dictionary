# Fried Lampreys

## Description
This recipe is for frying lampreys, a type of eel-like fish. The lampreys are first bled and cleaned, then cut into pieces. They are then fried in clarified butter with a pinch of flour, salt, pepper, nutmeg, white wine, bay leaf, sweet herbs, and capers. The dish is served hot.

## Ingredients:
- 2 lampreys
- Clarified butter
- Pinch of flour
- Salt
- Pepper
- Nutmeg
- 100 ml white wine
- 1 bay leaf
- Bunch of sweet herbs (such as parsley, thyme, and rosemary)
- 2 tablespoons capers

## Instructions:
1. Bleed the lampreys by cutting their throats and collecting the blood in a bowl. Set aside the blood for later use.
2. Remove the slime from the lampreys by rinsing them under cold water and patting them dry with paper towels.
3. Cut the lampreys into pieces, about 2-3 inches in length.
4. In a large frying pan, heat enough clarified butter to cover the bottom of the pan.
5. Add a pinch of flour to the butter and stir until it is well incorporated.
6. Season the lamprey pieces with salt, pepper, and nutmeg.
7. Place the lamprey pieces in the frying pan and cook them over medium heat until they are browned on all sides.
8. Add the white wine, bay leaf, and sweet herbs to the pan. Cook for another 5 minutes, or until the wine has reduced slightly.
9. Stir in the reserved lamprey blood and capers. Cook for an additional 2-3 minutes, or until the blood is heated through.
10. Remove the lamprey pieces from the pan and transfer them to a serving dish.
11. Pour the sauce from the pan over the lampreys.
12. Serve the fried lampreys hot.
