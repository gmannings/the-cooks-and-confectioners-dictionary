# Compost of Raspberries

## Description
Compost of Raspberries is a sweet and tangy dessert made with fresh raspberries and sugar. The raspberries are cooked in a sugar syrup until they become soft and the flavors meld together. This dish can be served on its own or used as a topping for cakes, ice cream, or yogurt.

## Ingredients:
- 500g fresh raspberries
- 200g granulated sugar

## Instructions:
1. In a medium-sized saucepan, combine the sugar and enough water to cover the raspberries.
2. Place the saucepan over medium heat and bring the mixture to a boil.
3. Once the sugar has dissolved and the mixture has come to a boil, reduce the heat to low.
4. Add the raspberries to the saucepan and gently stir to coat them in the sugar syrup.
5. Cover the saucepan and let the raspberries simmer for about 10 minutes, or until they have softened and the flavors have melded together.
6. If the raspberries are overripe, continue simmering for an additional 5 minutes to allow the sugar to reach a slightly higher degree.
7. Remove the saucepan from the heat and let the compost cool to room temperature.
8. Once cooled, transfer the compost to a serving dish or store it in an airtight container in the refrigerator until ready to use.

## Cooking time
Approximately 15 minutes
