# Wiolet Cakes

## Description
Wiolet Cakes are small, sweet confections made with a sugar syrup flavored with violet and lemon juice. They have a delicate floral flavor and can be made in different colors depending on the ingredients used.

## Options and commentary
- You can choose to make the cakes red, green, or blue depending on the juice you use.
- Adjust the amount of juice according to your taste preference.

## Ingredients:
- 200g double refined sugar
- Juice of violets
- Juice of lemons

## Instructions:
1. In a saucepan, combine the double refined sugar with a small amount of water to create a syrup. 
2. Place the saucepan over medium heat and bring the syrup to a boil. 
3. Continue boiling the syrup until it reaches a stage where it is almost turning back into sugar. This is known as the "soft ball stage" and can be tested by dropping a small amount of syrup into a bowl of cold water. It should form a soft ball that can be easily flattened.
4. Once the syrup reaches the soft ball stage, remove it from the heat.
5. Add the juice of violets and the juice of lemons to the syrup. The amount of juice will depend on your desired flavor intensity. For a stronger violet flavor, use more violet juice. For a stronger lemon flavor, use more lemon juice.
6. Stir the syrup well to combine the juices with the sugar.
7. If you want the cakes to be red, add both violet and lemon juice to the syrup. If you want them to be green, add violet juice and water. If you want them to be blue, add only violet juice.
8. Once the syrup is well mixed, pour it into small molds or onto a greased baking sheet to form small cakes.
9. Allow the cakes to cool and set completely before removing them from the molds or cutting them into desired shapes.
