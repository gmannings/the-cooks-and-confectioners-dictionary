# Roasted Pigeons with Bacon

## Description
This recipe is for roasted pigeons stuffed with a flavorful mixture of bacon, herbs, mushrooms, and truffles. The pigeons are then wrapped in veal and bacon slices and roasted to perfection. They are served with a delicious ragout made from ham, bacon, and a rich gravy.

## Ingredients:
- 4 pigeons
- 4 slices of bacon
- 100g of veal, thinly sliced
- 4 slices of ham
- 4 slices of mushroom
- 1 truffle, finely chopped
- 1 tablespoon of chopped chives
- 1 tablespoon of chopped parsley
- Salt and pepper, to taste
- 1 pinch of mixed spices
- 1 pinch of flour
- 1 cup of veal or chicken broth
- 1 faggot of fresh herbs (such as thyme, rosemary, and bay leaves)

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 180째C (350째F).
2. In a bowl, mix together the chopped bacon, spices, herbs, mushroom slices, truffle, chives, and parsley.
3. Prepare the pigeons by trussing them for roasting. Using your fingers, carefully lift the skin of the breast and stuff the mixture inside.
4. Spit the pigeons and wrap each one with a slice of veal and a slice of bacon. Secure with kitchen twine or toothpicks.
5. Place the pigeons on a roasting rack and place in the preheated oven. Roast for about 25-30 minutes, or until the internal temperature reaches 65째C (150째F).
6. While the pigeons are roasting, prepare the ragout. Cut the ham slices into thin strips and lightly beat them. Line the bottom of a stewpan with the ham strips and place over low heat to simmer.
7. Once the ham starts to stick to the bottom of the pan, add melted bacon and a pinch of flour. Stir well.
8. After a few turns over the stove, add the unsalted gravy, pepper, and the faggot of fresh herbs. Cover the stewpan and let it simmer gently.
9. When the ragout has thickened, remove any excess fat and add veal or chicken broth to further thicken it. Keep warm.
10. Once the pigeons are roasted, remove the bacon and veal wrapping. Place the pigeons on a serving dish and garnish with the ham slices.
11. Pour the ragout sauce over the pigeons and serve hot as a first course.
