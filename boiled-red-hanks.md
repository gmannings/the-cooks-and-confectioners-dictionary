# Boiled Red Hanks

## Description
Boiled Red Hanks is a traditional 18th-century dish made with roasted red hanks (presumably a type of meat), flavored with cloves and spices, and served in a rich broth with onions. It is a hearty and flavorful dish that can be enjoyed as a main course.

## Ingredients:
- 1 kg of pork loin (or any other meat of your choice)
- Cloves
- 1 liter of water
- 500 ml of strong broth (beef or vegetable)
- 250 ml of red wine (Claret)
- 1 onion, fried
- Salt
- Pepper
- Mace (optional)

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 180Â°C.
2. Place the pork loin on a roasting rack and roast it in the preheated oven until it is half cooked. This should take about 30 minutes.
3. Remove the pork loin from the oven and stick cloves into the meat.
4. In a large pot, bring a small quantity of water (about 250 ml) to a boil.
5. Carefully place the half-roasted pork loin into the boiling water and let it simmer for a couple of minutes.
6. Pour out all but 500 ml of the water from the pot.
7. Add the strong broth, red wine, the gravy that dripped from the meat during roasting, fried onion, cloves, mace (if using), salt, and pepper to the pot.
8. Stir the ingredients together and bring the mixture to a simmer.
9. Reduce the heat to low and let the ingredients stew together for about 1 hour, or until the meat is tender and the flavors have melded.
10. While the meat is stewing, prepare sippets by toasting or frying slices of bread until they are crispy.
11. Once the meat is tender, remove it from the pot and slice it into serving portions.
12. To serve, place a sippet in each bowl or plate and top it with a portion of the sliced meat. Ladle the broth and onions over the meat.
13. Serve the Boiled Red Hanks hot and enjoy!
