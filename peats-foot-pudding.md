# Peats Foot Pudding

## Description
Peats Foot Pudding is a traditional 18th-century dish made with minced neats feet (calf's feet) and beef suet. It is flavored with cinnamon, sugar, orange peel, and currants. The mixture is then combined with eggs and grated bread, stuffed into a pudding bag, and boiled for two hours. It is typically served with a sweet sauce.

## Ingredients:
- 2 neats feet (calf's feet)
- 250g beef suet
- Salt, to taste
- 1 teaspoon cinnamon
- 1 tablespoon sugar
- 60g orange peel, finely minced
- 2 handfuls of grated bread
- 6-8 eggs
- Currants, to taste
- Butter, for greasing the pudding bag

## Instructions:
1. In a large pot, bring water to a boil. Add the neats feet and boil until tender. This may take several hours, so plan accordingly.
2. Once the neats feet are tender, remove them from the pot and allow them to cool slightly. Remove the meat from the bones and mince it finely.
3. In a mixing bowl, combine the minced neats feet with the beef suet. Season with salt, cinnamon, and sugar. Mix well.
4. Add the minced orange peel, grated bread, eggs, and currants to the bowl. Mix everything together until well combined.
5. Grease a pudding bag with butter to prevent sticking. Place the pudding mixture into the bag, making sure to leave some room for expansion.
6. Tie the pudding bag tightly to secure the mixture inside. Make sure it is well sealed.
7. Place the pudding bag in a large pot of boiling water. Make sure the water covers the pudding bag completely.
8. Boil the pudding for two hours, making sure to check the water level occasionally and adding more boiling water if needed.
9. After two hours, carefully remove the pudding bag from the pot. Allow it to cool slightly before opening the bag.
10. Serve the Peats Foot Pudding with a sweet sauce of your choice.
