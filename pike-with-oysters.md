# Pike with Oysters

## Description
This recipe is for a dish made with pike fish and oysters. The pike is minced with eel and sweet herbs, seasoned with salt, pepper, nutmeg, and mace, and then stewed in white wine. The dish is garnished with stewed oysters, some green with spinach and others yellow with saffron. It is served hot on sippets.

- You can adjust the seasoning according to your taste preferences.
- The dish can be served with a side of vegetables or mashed potatoes.
