# Fried Tench with White Wine and Capers

## Description
This recipe is for fried tench, a type of freshwater fish. The fish is first fried in browned butter to give it a crispy exterior, then stewed in a flavorful sauce made with white wine, verjuice (a sour juice made from unripe grapes), and various herbs and spices. The dish is finished with the addition of capers, oysters, mushroom juice, and lemon juice, and garnished with fried bread.

## Ingredients:
- 2 tench fillets
- 2 tablespoons butter
- 1/4 cup white wine
- 1/4 cup verjuice (can be substituted with lemon juice)
- Salt and pepper to taste
- 1/4 teaspoon nutmeg
- A bunch of fresh herbs (such as parsley, thyme, and dill)
- 1-2 bay leaves
- 1 tablespoon flour
- 2 tablespoons capers
- 4-6 oysters
- Juice of 1 mushroom (can be substituted with mushroom broth)
- Juice of 1 lemon
- 2 slices of bread

## Instructions:
1. Cut the tench fillets into serving-sized pieces.
2. In a large frying pan, melt the butter over medium heat.
3. Add the tench fillets to the pan and fry them until they are golden brown on both sides. Remove the fillets from the pan and set them aside.
4. In the same pan, add the white wine and verjuice. Allow the liquid to come to a simmer.
5. Season the liquid with salt, pepper, and nutmeg.
6. Tie the fresh herbs and bay leaves together with kitchen twine to make a bouquet garni. Add the bouquet garni to the pan.
7. Sprinkle the flour over the liquid and stir well to combine. This will help thicken the sauce.
8. Return the fried tench fillets to the pan and spoon the sauce over them.
9. Cover the pan and let the tench stew in the sauce for about 10-15 minutes, or until the fish is cooked through and tender.
10. While the tench is stewing, fry the bread slices in a separate pan until they are crispy and golden brown. Set aside.
11. After the tench is cooked, remove the bouquet garni from the pan.
12. Add the capers, oysters, mushroom juice, and lemon juice to the pan. Stir gently to combine.
13. Cook for an additional 2-3 minutes, or until the oysters are heated through.
14. To serve, place the fried bread slices on a serving platter and arrange the tench fillets on top. Spoon the sauce, capers, oysters, and mushrooms over the fish.
15. Garnish with additional fresh herbs, if desired.
