# Shrimp Buttered

## Description
Shrimp Buttered is a dish made with shrimp cooked in a white wine sauce, thickened with eggs and butter. It is served on sippets, which are small pieces of toasted bread.

## Ingredients:
- 2 quarts of shrimp
- 1 pint of white wine
- Nutmeg
- 8 eggs
- 1/2 pound of butter
- Sippets (small pieces of toasted bread)

## Instructions:
1. In a large pot, combine the shrimp and white wine. Add a pinch of nutmeg.
2. Bring the mixture to a simmer over medium heat and cook for about 5 minutes, or until the shrimp are cooked through.
3. In a separate bowl, beat the eggs with a splash of white wine.
4. Melt the butter in a frying pan over low heat.
5. Slowly pour the beaten eggs into the melted butter, stirring constantly.
6. Continue stirring until the mixture thickens to a custard-like consistency.
7. Remove the shrimp from the pot and drain any excess liquid.
8. Add the shrimp to the egg and butter mixture in the frying pan.
9. Stir the shrimp gently to coat them evenly with the sauce.
