# Another Way Pudding

## Description
Another Way Pudding is a rich and creamy dessert made with ale, sack (a type of fortified wine), eggs, sugar, and cream or milk. It has a thick and custard-like consistency and is served chilled.

## Ingredients:
- 1/2 pint (240 ml) ale
- 1 quart (960 ml) sack (fortified wine)
- 1 1/2 pounds (680 g) sugar
- 30 egg whites
- 4 egg yolks
- 3 quarts (2.8 liters) cream or milk

## Instructions:
1. In a large pot, bring the ale, sack, and sugar to a boil over medium heat. Stir until the sugar is dissolved.
2. In a separate bowl, beat the egg whites until stiff peaks form. Set aside.
3. In another bowl, beat the egg yolks until well beaten.
4. Slowly pour the beaten egg yolks into the boiling ale mixture, stirring constantly to prevent curdling.
5. Continue stirring until the mixture thickens.
6. In a separate pot, bring the cream or milk to a boil. Let it cool.
7. Once the ale mixture has cooled, pour in the boiled cream or milk and stir well to combine.
8. Pour the mixture into individual serving bowls or basins.
9. Cover the bowls with plates and refrigerate until set and chilled.
10. Serve the Another Way Pudding cold.
