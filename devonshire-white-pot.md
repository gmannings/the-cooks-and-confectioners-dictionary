# Devonshire White-pot

## Description
Devonshire White-pot is a traditional English dish made with soaked bread, milk, eggs, and butter. It is similar to a bread pudding and has a creamy, custard-like texture.

## Options and commentary
- You can choose to make the white-pot with either flour or rice, or without both. The flour or rice helps to thicken the mixture.
- You can add some flavorings such as vanilla extract, cinnamon, or nutmeg to enhance the taste.
- Serve the white-pot warm or chilled, with a sprinkle of powdered sugar or a dollop of whipped cream on top.

## Ingredients:
- 4 slices of white bread
- 2 cups of milk
- 2 tablespoons of all-purpose flour or 1/4 cup of rice (optional)
- 2 egg yolks
- 2 tablespoons of butter
- Optional flavorings: 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract, 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon, or a pinch of nutmeg
- Optional toppings: powdered sugar, whipped cream

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F).
2. In a bowl, soak the slices of white bread in the milk for about 10 minutes until the bread becomes soft and absorbs the milk.
3. If using flour or rice, add it to the soaked bread mixture and mix well. This will help thicken the white-pot.
4. In a separate bowl, beat the egg yolks until well beaten.
5. Add the beaten egg yolks to the bread mixture and mix until well combined. If using any optional flavorings, add them now and mix well.
6. Grease a deep oven-safe dish with butter or cooking spray.
7. Pour the bread mixture into the greased dish and spread it evenly.
8. Place small pieces of butter on top of the mixture.
9. Cover the dish with a sheet of parchment paper or aluminum foil.
10. Place the dish in the preheated oven, near the mouth of it, and bake for about 45-50 minutes or until the top is golden brown and the center is set.
11. Remove the white-pot from the oven and let it cool for a few minutes before serving.
12. Serve the Devonshire White-pot warm or chilled. You can dust it with powdered sugar or serve it with a dollop of whipped cream on top, if desired.
