# Fealon a Meal Pye

## Description
Fealon a Meal Pye is a traditional 18th century dish made with a joint of veal or any other proportionable joint. The meat is seasoned with a mixture of salt, pepper, cloves, mace, currants, and butter. The pye can be served hot or cold, and if served hot, it is accompanied by a pint of gravy.

## Options and commentary
- You can use a loin of veal or any other joint of meat that is proportionate in size.
- If you prefer a different type of meat, such as lamb, you can use the same seasoning mixture and encase it in pastry.
- The pye can be served hot or cold, depending on your preference.

## Ingredients:
- 1 joint of veal or other proportionate joint of meat
- 2 ounces of salt
- 1 ounce of pepper
- 1 ounce of cloves and mace, finely beaten
- 1/4 ounce of whole mace
- 1/2 pound of currants
- 2 pounds of butter
- 1 pint of gravy (if serving hot)

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F).
2. In a small bowl, mix together the salt, pepper, cloves, and finely beaten mace.
3. Rub the seasoning mixture all over the joint of meat, ensuring it is evenly coated.
4. Place the joint of meat in a large baking dish or roasting pan.
5. Sprinkle the currants over the meat.
6. Cut the butter into small pieces and scatter them over the meat and currants.
7. If serving the pye hot, pour the pint of gravy into the baking dish or roasting pan. If serving cold, you can add more gravy if desired.
8. Cover the baking dish or roasting pan with aluminum foil or a lid.
9. Place the dish in the preheated oven and cook for approximately 2-3 hours, or until the meat is tender and cooked through.
10. If serving the pye hot, remove the foil or lid during the last 30 minutes of cooking to allow the top to brown.
11. Once cooked, remove the dish from the oven and let it rest for a few minutes before serving.
