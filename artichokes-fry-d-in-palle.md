# Artichokes Fry'd in Palle

## Description
This recipe is for fried artichokes that are coated in a simple flour paste and then fried until crispy. The artichokes are served with fried parsley and a touch of rose vinegar, which adds a tangy flavor to the dish.

## Ingredients:
- 4 artichokes
- 1 cup all-purpose flour
- 1 cup water
- Salt, to taste
- Pepper, to taste
- Vegetable oil, for frying
- Fresh parsley, for garnish
- Rose vinegar, for serving

## Instructions:
1. Start by preparing the artichokes. Remove the tough outer leaves until you reach the tender, pale green leaves. Cut off the top third of the artichokes and trim the stem. Cut the artichokes in half lengthwise and remove the choke (the fuzzy part) from the center. Place the artichoke halves in a bowl of water with lemon juice to prevent browning.
2. In a mixing bowl, combine the flour, water, salt, and pepper to make a smooth paste. The consistency should be similar to pancake batter.
3. Drain the artichoke halves and pat them dry with a paper towel.
4. Heat vegetable oil in a deep frying pan or pot to a temperature of 180°C (350°F).
5. Dip each artichoke half into the flour paste, making sure to coat it evenly. Allow any excess batter to drip off.
6. Carefully place the coated artichokes into the hot oil, one at a time. Fry them until they turn golden brown and crispy, which should take about 3-4 minutes per side.
7. Once the artichokes are fried, remove them from the oil using a slotted spoon and place them on a paper towel-lined plate to drain excess oil.
8. In the same hot oil, fry a handful of fresh parsley leaves until they become crispy. This should only take a few seconds. Remove the fried parsley from the oil and place it on the paper towel-lined plate.
9. Arrange the fried artichokes on a serving platter and sprinkle the crispy fried parsley over the top.
10. Serve the artichokes with a drizzle of rose vinegar on top for added flavor.
