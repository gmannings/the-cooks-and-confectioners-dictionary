# Poached Eggs

## Description
Poached eggs are a classic breakfast dish where eggs are gently cooked in simmering water. The eggs have a soft, runny yolk and a delicate, silky texture. They are often served on toast or with other breakfast items.

## Ingredients:
- Water
- Vinegar
- Cloves
- Mace
- Eggs
- Slices of bread (for sippets)
- Butter
- Additional vinegar (for the sauce)

## Instructions:
1. Fill a large saucepan with water and add vinegar, cloves, and mace. The amount of water and vinegar will depend on how many eggs you are poaching, but a general guideline is to use about 1 cup of water and 1 tablespoon of vinegar for each egg.
2. Place the saucepan over medium heat and bring the water to a gentle simmer. The water should be hot but not boiling vigorously.
3. Crack each egg into a small bowl or ramekin, taking care not to break the yolk.
4. Using a spoon or a whisk, create a gentle whirlpool in the simmering water. This will help the egg whites wrap around the yolk and form a neat shape.
5. Carefully slide each egg into the simmering water, one at a time. The eggs should sink to the bottom of the pan.
6. Use a slotted spoon to gently stir the water around each egg, helping the whites to set and form a round shape. Be careful not to break the yolks.
7. Cook the eggs for about 3-4 minutes, or until the whites are set but the yolks are still soft and runny. You can adjust the cooking time depending on how you like your eggs.
8. Once the eggs are cooked to your liking, use the slotted spoon to carefully lift them out of the water and onto a plate lined with paper towels. This will help absorb any excess water.
9. Trim off any uneven or unattractive parts of the poached eggs.
10. While the eggs are cooking, prepare the sippets by toasting slices of bread until golden brown. Cut the toast into small triangles or squares.
11. Arrange the sippets in a dish or on individual plates.
12. In a small saucepan, melt butter over low heat. Add a splash of vinegar and stir to combine. The amount of butter and vinegar will depend on your preference, but a general guideline is to use about 1 tablespoon of butter and 1 teaspoon of vinegar for each serving.
13. Pour the butter and vinegar sauce over the sippets.
14. Carefully place the poached eggs on top of the sippets.
15. Serve the poached eggs immediately while they are still hot.
