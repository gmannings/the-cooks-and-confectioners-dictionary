# White Broth

## Description
White Broth is a comforting and flavorful soup made with mutton broth, spices, dried fruit, and sweet herbs. It is thickened with almonds and egg yolks, sweetened with sugar, and served with slices of white bread. It can be enjoyed on its own or served with any meat dish.

## Ingredients:
- Mutton broth
- Sack (a type of fortified wine)
- Salt
- Whole spice (such as cloves, cinnamon, and nutmeg)
- Dates
- Currants
- Sweet herbs (such as parsley, thyme, and bay leaves)
- Blanch'd almonds
- Egg yolks
- Sugar
- Thin slices of white bread
- Stewed prunes
- Plump raisins

## Instructions:
1. In a large pot, combine mutton broth and sack in equal quantities. Add salt, whole spice, dates, sliced currants, and sweet herbs.
2. Bring the mixture to a boil and then reduce the heat to a simmer. Let it cook for about 1 hour, or until the flavors have melded together.
3. In a separate bowl, blanch the almonds by pouring boiling water over them and letting them sit for a few minutes. Drain the almonds and remove their skins.
4. Once the broth is ready, strain it to remove the solids and return it to the pot.
5. Add the blanched almonds to the broth and simmer for another 10 minutes.
6. In a small bowl, beat the egg yolks until smooth. Gradually add some of the hot broth to the egg yolks, whisking constantly to temper them.
7. Slowly pour the tempered egg yolks into the pot of broth, stirring continuously.
8. Add sugar to taste, adjusting the sweetness according to your preference.
9. Continue to simmer the broth for another 5 minutes, stirring occasionally to prevent the eggs from curdling.
10. Remove the pot from the heat and let the broth cool slightly before serving.
11. To serve, ladle the white broth into bowls and garnish with thin slices of white bread. Optionally, add stewed prunes and plump raisins as a garnish.
