# Boiled Venison with Spinach and Cauliflower

## Description
This recipe is for boiled venison served with spinach and cauliflower. The venison is first boiled in water, while the cauliflower is boiled in milk and water. The spinach is boiled in broth and then seasoned with vinegar, drawn butter, and nutmeg. The dish is assembled with a layer of sippets (small pieces of toasted bread) at the bottom, followed by the spinach arranged around the sides, the venison in the middle, and the cauliflower on top. The dish is garnished with barberries and minced parsley.

## Options and commentary
- Instead of boiling the venison, you can also roast or grill it for a different flavor.
- Feel free to adjust the seasoning according to your taste preferences.
- If you prefer a vegetarian version, you can omit the venison and focus on the spinach and cauliflower.

## Ingredients:
- 1 venison haunch or other cuts
- Salt and pepper, to taste
- 6 cauliflower florets
- 1 cup milk
- 1 cup water
- 1 bunch spinach
- 2 cups strong broth (vegetable or meat-based)
- 2 tablespoons vinegar
- 4 tablespoons drawn butter (melted butter)
- 1/2 teaspoon grated nutmeg
- Sippets (small pieces of toasted bread)
- Barberries, for garnish
- Minced parsley, for garnish

## Instructions:
1. If desired, preheat the oven to the appropriate temperature for roasting the venison.
2. Season the venison with salt and pepper, then place it in a large pot filled with enough water to cover it. Bring the water to a boil and then reduce the heat to a simmer. Cook the venison until it reaches the desired level of doneness. The cooking time will vary depending on the size and cut of the venison.
3. While the venison is cooking, bring a separate pot of milk and water to a boil. Add the cauliflower florets and cook until they are tender. Drain the cauliflower and set it aside.
4. In another pot, bring the strong broth to a boil. Add the spinach and cook until it wilts. Drain the spinach and transfer it to a bowl. Season the spinach with vinegar, 2 tablespoons of drawn butter, and grated nutmeg. Mix well to combine.
5. Once the venison is cooked, remove it from the pot and let it rest for a few minutes. If desired, you can also sauce the venison by combining minced sweet herbs, parsley, beef suet, and hard-boiled egg yolks seasoned with salt, pepper, and nutmeg. Spread the sauce over the venison.
6. To assemble the dish, place sippets in the bottom of a serving dish. Arrange the seasoned spinach around the sides of the dish. Place the venison in the center. Arrange the cauliflower florets on top of the venison. Drizzle the remaining drawn butter over the dish.
7. Garnish the dish with barberries and minced parsley.
8. Serve the boiled venison with spinach and cauliflower hot.

## Cooking time
- The cooking time for the venison will vary depending on the size and cut of the meat.
- The cauliflower will take about 10-15 minutes to cook.
- The spinach will take about 5-7 minutes to cook.
- The overall cooking time will depend on the cooking method chosen for the venison.
