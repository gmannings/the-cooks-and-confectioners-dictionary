## Description
This recipe is for broiling bacon slices to a crispy perfection. Broiling is a cooking method that involves direct heat from above, resulting in a deliciously crispy texture.

## Ingredients:

## Instructions:
1. Preheat your broiler to high heat.
2. Take a sheet of parchment paper and fold it into the shape of a drip pan.
3. Cut the bacon slices into thin strips, removing the rind.
4. Place the bacon slices on the parchment paper.
5. Place the parchment paper with the bacon on a broiler pan or directly on the broiler rack.
6. Position the broiler rack about 4-6 inches away from the heat source.
7. Broil the bacon for about 3-5 minutes per side, or until it reaches your desired level of crispiness.
8. Keep a close eye on the bacon to prevent it from burning.
9. Once the bacon is crispy, remove it from the broiler and transfer it to a paper towel-lined plate to drain excess grease.
