# Puff Pastry

## Description
Puff pastry is a light and flaky pastry made by layering dough and butter. It is commonly used in both sweet and savory dishes, such as pies, tarts, and pastries.

## Ingredients:
- 500g all-purpose flour
- 4 egg whites
- 225g unsalted butter, chilled and cut into small cubes
- Cold water

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 200°C (400°F).

2. In a large mixing bowl, combine the flour and egg whites. Mix well until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs.

3. Add the chilled butter cubes to the flour mixture. Using your fingertips or a pastry cutter, rub the butter into the flour until the mixture resembles breadcrumbs.

4. Gradually add cold water, a little at a time, while mixing the dough with your hands. Continue adding water until the dough comes together and can be formed into a ball. Be careful not to overmix.

5. Transfer the dough onto a lightly floured surface. Roll the dough out into a large rectangle, about 1/4 inch thick.

6. Sprinkle about 75g of the chilled butter cubes evenly over the surface of the dough.

7. Fold the dough in thirds, like a letter, by folding the bottom third up and the top third down. Press the edges lightly to seal.

8. Rotate the dough 90 degrees and roll it out again into a large rectangle. Sprinkle another 75g of butter cubes over the surface and fold in thirds again.

9. Repeat the rolling, sprinkling of butter, and folding process two more times, until you have used all the butter cubes.

10. Butter the edges of a baking dish or pie dish.

11. Carefully transfer the rolled and folded pastry into the prepared dish, pressing it gently against the bottom and sides.

12. Place the dish into the preheated oven and bake for approximately 1 hour, or until the pastry is golden brown and crispy.

13. Remove from the oven and let it cool slightly before serving.
