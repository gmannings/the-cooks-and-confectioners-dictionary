# Broiled Lobsters

## Description
This recipe is for broiling lobsters. The lobsters are boiled first and then placed on a gridiron to be broiled. They are basted with butter and vinegar while broiling. Once cooked, they are served with a sauce made from butter, vinegar, nutmeg, and sliced lemon.

## Options and commentary
- You can choose to baste the lobsters with just butter or a mixture of butter and vinegar, depending on your preference.
- Adjust the amount of nutmeg and lemon slices according to your taste.

## Ingredients:
- 2 lobsters
- Butter
- Vinegar
- Nutmeg
- 1 lemon, sliced

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the broiler in your oven.
2. Fill a large pot with water and bring it to a boil.
3. Place the lobsters in the boiling water and cook them until they are fully cooked. This usually takes about 10-12 minutes per pound of lobster.
4. Remove the lobsters from the pot and let them cool slightly.
5. Once the lobsters are cool enough to handle, use a sharp knife to split them in half lengthwise.
6. Place the lobster halves on a greased gridiron or grill pan.
7. Melt some butter in a small saucepan. If desired, add vinegar to the melted butter to create a basting mixture.
8. Brush the lobster halves with the butter (and vinegar, if using) mixture.
9. Place the gridiron or grill pan with the lobsters under the preheated broiler.
10. Broil the lobsters for about 5-7 minutes, or until they are heated through and the meat is slightly charred.
11. While the lobsters are broiling, prepare the sauce. In a small bowl, mix together melted butter, vinegar, grated nutmeg, and sliced lemon.
12. Remove the lobsters from the broiler and transfer them to a serving platter.
13. Serve the broiled lobsters with the prepared sauce on the side.
