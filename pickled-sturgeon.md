# Pickled Sturgeon

## Description
This recipe is for pickling sturgeon, a type of fish. The sturgeon is prepared by splitting it down the back, removing the roe (if it is a female), and cutting the fillets. The fillets are then bound together with tape or string, seasoned with salt, and boiled. The boiling process helps to remove excess oil and preserve the fish. The pickled sturgeon can be enjoyed as a savory and tangy dish.

## Options and commentary
- If you don't have access to sturgeon, you can try this recipe with another firm-fleshed fish like salmon or halibut.
- You can add additional spices or herbs to the pickling liquid for extra flavor.
- The pickled sturgeon can be served cold as an appetizer or used in salads and sandwiches.

## Ingredients:
- 1 sturgeon (or substitute with another firm-fleshed fish)
- Salt

## Instructions:
1. If the sturgeon is a female, remove the roe and set it aside to make caviar.
2. Split the sturgeon down the back and remove any internal organs.
3. Cut the fillets away from the bones, keeping the skin intact.
4. Trim the fillets into even pieces, discarding the tail piece.
5. Bind the fillet pieces together with tape or string to keep them secure during cooking.
6. Season the fillets generously with salt, ensuring all sides are coated.
7. Fill a large pot with water and bring it to a boil.
8. Carefully place the bound fillets into the boiling water.
9. Boil the sturgeon for 1 and a half hours, skimming off any oil that rises to the surface.
10. Throughout the boiling process, keep the water level topped up with hot water to prevent the sturgeon from becoming rusty.
11. After the cooking time is complete, remove the sturgeon from the pot and allow it to cool.
12. Once cooled, remove the tape or string and transfer the sturgeon to a clean container.
13. Store the pickled sturgeon in the refrigerator for at least 24 hours before serving to allow the flavors to develop.
