# Louced Breast of Mutton

## Description
Louced Breast of Mutton is a traditional dish made with a boneless breast of mutton that is seasoned with a mixture of salt, nutmeg, ginger, sweet herbs, and lemon peel. The seasoned meat is then rolled into a collar, tied up in a cloth, and cooked in boiling liquid. The dish can be finished by adding white wine, lemon slices, lemon peel, and bay leaves. It can be boiled or baked in a pot.

## Options and commentary
