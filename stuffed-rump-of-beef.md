# Stuffed Rump of Beef

## Description
This recipe involves boiling a rump of beef until it is partially cooked, then removing the skin and stuffing it with a mixture of salt, pepper, mace, nutmeg, parsley, marjoram, savory, and thyme. The beef is then seasoned with additional spices, coated with beaten egg, and baked in a deep pan with a mixture of gravy, claret, and vinegar. The dish is served with the cooking liquid poured over it.

## Options and commentary
- You can adjust the amount of seasoning according to your taste preferences.
- You can use a different type of wine instead of claret, such as red wine or beef broth.
- The cooking time may vary depending on the size and thickness of the rump of beef.

## Ingredients:
- 1 rump of beef
- Salt
- Pepper
- 1 teaspoon beaten mace
- 1 teaspoon grated nutmeg
- 1 tablespoon chopped parsley
- 1 tablespoon chopped marjoram
- 1 tablespoon chopped savory
- 1 tablespoon chopped thyme
- 2 eggs, beaten
- 1 pint (473 ml) claret or red wine
- 2 tablespoons vinegar

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F).
2. Place the rump of beef in a large pot and cover it with water. Bring the water to a boil and cook the beef until it is more than half cooked. This will take approximately 1-2 hours, depending on the size of the beef.
3. Remove the beef from the pot and let it cool slightly. Peel off the skin and discard.
4. In a small bowl, mix together salt, pepper, mace, nutmeg, parsley, marjoram, savory, and thyme.
5. Using a sharp knife, make large holes through the fat of the beef. Stuff the seasoning mixture into the holes.
6. Sprinkle the remaining seasoning mixture all over the top of the beef.
7. Brush the beaten eggs over the seasoned beef to bind the seasoning.
8. In a deep baking pan, combine the gravy that ran out while stuffing the beef, claret, and vinegar.
9. Place the stuffed beef in the baking pan, ensuring that the liquid fills the pan up to the top.
10. Bake the beef in the preheated oven for approximately 2 hours, or until it reaches your desired level of doneness.
11. Remove the beef from the oven and transfer it to a serving dish.
12. Pour the cooking liquid from the baking pan all over the beef.
13. Serve the stuffed rump of beef hot, with the cooking liquid as a sauce.
