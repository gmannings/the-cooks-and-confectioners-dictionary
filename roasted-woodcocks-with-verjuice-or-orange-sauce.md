# Roasted Woodcocks with Verjuice or Orange Sauce

## Description
This recipe is for roasting woodcocks, a type of game bird, in the French style. The woodcocks are prepared by pulling, drawing, and washing them, and then trussing them. They are then larded with broad pieces of bacon over their breasts. The woodcocks are roasted and served on toasts dipped in verjuice (a sour juice made from unripe grapes) or the juice of oranges. The gravy from the roasting pan is also used to make the sauce, which is served warm.

## Options and commentary
- Instead of verjuice, you can use lemon juice or white wine as a substitute.
- If you prefer a sweeter sauce, you can use the juice of oranges instead of verjuice.
- The cooking time will vary depending on the size of the woodcocks, but it is typically around 15-20 minutes.

## Ingredients:
- 2 woodcocks
- 4 slices of bacon
- Verjuice or juice of 2 oranges
- Salt and pepper to taste
- Red Port wine
- Cullis of veal and ham (optional)

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F).
2. Pull the woodcocks to remove any feathers.
3. Draw the woodcocks by removing the innards and cleaning the cavity.
4. Wash the woodcocks thoroughly under cold water.
5. Truss the woodcocks by tying their legs together with kitchen twine.
6. Lard the woodcocks by inserting broad pieces of bacon over their breasts.
7. Place the woodcocks on a roasting rack in a roasting pan.
8. Roast the woodcocks in the preheated oven for about 15-20 minutes, or until they are cooked through and the bacon is crispy.
9. While the woodcocks are roasting, prepare the sauce. In a saucepan, bruise the guts and livers of the woodcocks.
10. Season the guts and livers with salt and pepper.
11. Add a splash of red Port wine to moisten the mixture.
12. If the sauce is not thick enough, you can thicken it with a little cullis of veal and ham.
13. Heat the sauce over low heat until it is hot.
14. Squeeze in the juice of 2 oranges or use verjuice as desired.
15. Cut up the roasted woodcocks and place them in the sauce.
