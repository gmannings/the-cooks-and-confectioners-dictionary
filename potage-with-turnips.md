# Potage with Turnips

## Description
Potage with Turnips is a hearty soup made with sliced turnips that are fried and then simmered in a flavorful broth. It is traditionally served with fried bread or sausages and can be garnished with herbs. This dish is a comforting and satisfying option for a cold day.

## Ingredients:
- Turnips
- Lard or cooking oil
- Flour
- Broth (vegetable or chicken)
- Salt
- Pepper
- Bunch of fresh herbs (such as parsley, thyme, and bay leaves)
- Thickening agent (such as cornstarch or flour)
- Fowls (optional)
- Gravy
- Lemon juice

## Instructions:
1. Peel the turnips and cut them into round slices.
2. Heat lard or cooking oil in a pan and fry the turnip slices until they are golden brown. You can use the same lard in which you fried any type of fowl that you plan to serve with the potage.
3. Remove the fried turnips from the pan and set them aside.
4. In a pot, combine the fried turnips, good broth, salt, pepper, and a bunch of fresh herbs.
5. Let the potage simmer over low heat, allowing the flavors to meld together.
6. In a separate bowl, prepare a thickening agent by mixing cornstarch or flour with a small amount of water until it forms a smooth paste.
7. Gradually add the thickening agent to the potage, stirring constantly, until the desired consistency is reached.
8. While the potage is simmering, prepare the fowls and turnips for serving. Dress and garnish them with fried bread or sausages, if desired.
9. When you are ready to serve, add some good gravy and lemon juice to the potage for added flavor.
10. Ladle the potage into bowls and serve hot.
