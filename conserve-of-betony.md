# Conserve of Betony

## Description
Conserve of Betony is a sweet and thick preserve made from betony herb and sugar. It has a rich flavor and can be enjoyed on its own or used as a topping for desserts.

## Ingredients:
- 500 grams of betony herb
- 1.5 kilograms of fine sugar
- 2 liters of water

## Instructions:
1. Wash the betony herb thoroughly to remove any dirt or impurities. Pat dry with a clean towel.
2. In a large stone mortar, pound the betony herb until it forms a paste-like consistency.
3. In a separate pot, combine the sugar and water. Bring to a boil over medium heat, stirring occasionally to dissolve the sugar.
4. Once the sugar has dissolved, add the pounded betony herb to the pot.
5. Reduce the heat to low and simmer the mixture for about 1 hour, or until it reaches the thickness of a syrup. Stir occasionally to prevent sticking.
6. Remove the pot from the heat and let the mixture cool slightly.
7. Transfer the mixture to clean glass jars, making sure to leave some headspace at the top.
8. Seal the jars tightly and store in a cool, dark place.
9. The conserve of betony can be enjoyed immediately, but the flavors will develop and intensify over time.
