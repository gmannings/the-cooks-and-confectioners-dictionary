# Stewed Prawns in Wine and Butter

## Description
This recipe is for a classic dish of prawns stewed in a flavorful mixture of white wine or claret, butter, and seasonings. The prawns are then served in scallop shells and topped with a rich butter sauce flavored with orange or lemon juice. Alternatively, you can stew the prawns in butter and cream and serve them in scallop shells.

## Ingredients:
- 500g prawns, boiled and peeled
- 250ml white wine or claret
