# Lemon Almond Biscuits

## Description
These Lemon Almond Biscuits are a sweet treat made with blanched almonds, lemon rind, and sugar. They have a delicate lemon flavor and a chewy texture. Perfect for enjoying with a cup of tea or coffee.

## Ingredients:
- Rind of 1 lemon
- 250g blanched almonds
- 50g gum dragon (substitute with gum arabic if unavailable)
- 500g fine sugar
- 2 egg whites

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F).
2. Place the lemon rind in a small saucepan and cover with boiling water. Cook for about 5 minutes or until the rind is tender. Drain and set aside.
3. In a separate bowl, blanch the almonds by placing them in cold water for a few minutes. Remove the skins by gently squeezing the almonds between your fingers. Discard the skins.
4. Soak the gum dragon in a small bowl of water for about 10 minutes or until softened.
5. In a mortar and pestle or a food processor, pound the blanched almonds until they form a paste. Gradually add the egg whites while pounding to create a smooth mixture.
6. Pound the cooked lemon rind in a mortar and pestle until it forms a paste.
7. Add the softened gum dragon and the lemon paste to the almond mixture. Mix well to combine.
8. In a separate mortar and pestle, pound 1 pound (450g) of fine sugar until it becomes a fine powder.
9. Gradually add the powdered sugar to the almond mixture, stirring with a spoon to incorporate it.
10. Once all the sugar is added, continue stirring until the mixture forms a smooth dough.
11. Take small portions of the dough and roll them into small rolls or balls.
12. Place the rolls on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper or white papers.
13. Bake in the preheated oven for about 15-20 minutes or until the biscuits are lightly golden.
14. Remove from the oven and let the biscuits cool completely before serving.
