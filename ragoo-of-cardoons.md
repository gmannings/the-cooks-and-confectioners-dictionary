# Ragoo of Cardoons

## Description
A ragoo of cardoons is a rich and flavorful dish made with cardoons, a type of thistle-like vegetable. The cardoons are boiled in white wine with butter, flour, salt, onion, cloves, and bacon. After boiling, they are simmered in a sauce made from veal and ham stock. The dish is finished with a roux made from butter and flour.

## Ingredients:
- 500g cardoons
- 250ml white wine
- 50g butter
- 1 tablespoon flour
- Salt, to taste
- 1 onion
- 4 cloves
- 2-3 slices of bacon
- 250ml veal stock
- 100g ham, diced
- 1 tablespoon butter
- 1 tablespoon flour

## Instructions:
1. Pick and clean the cardoons, removing any tough outer leaves and trimming the ends. Cut the cardoons into 5cm pieces.
2. In a large pot, combine the white wine, butter, flour, salt, onion studded with cloves, and bacon slices. Bring the mixture to a boil.
3. Once the water is boiling, add the cardoons to the pot. Boil for about 15 minutes, or until the cardoons are slightly tender.
4. Remove the cardoons from the pot and let them drain.
5. In a saucepan, combine the veal stock and diced ham. Simmer over a gentle fire.
6. Add the drained cardoons to the saucepan and continue simmering until the cardoons are cooked through.
7. In a separate small saucepan, melt the butter over low heat. Stir in the flour to create a roux.
8. Gradually add the roux to the cardoons and sauce mixture, stirring constantly until the butter is melted and the sauce thickens.
9. Serve the ragoo of cardoons hot.
