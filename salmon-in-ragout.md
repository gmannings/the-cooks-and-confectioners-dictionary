# Salmon in Ragout

## Description
This recipe is for baking salmon slices in a flavorful sauce, known as a ragout. The salmon is cooked in the oven with a mixture of wine, fish broth, verjuice (a sour juice made from unripe grapes), and various herbs and spices. While the salmon is baking, a ragout sauce is prepared using the salmon liver, mushrooms, fried flour, capers, and oysters. The ragout is then poured over the baked salmon and served with a squeeze of lemon juice.

## Ingredients:
- 1 salmon fillet, sliced
- 1/2 cup white wine
- 1/2 cup fish broth
- 1/4 cup verjuice (can be substituted with lemon juice)
- Salt and pepper to taste
- A bunch of fresh herbs (such as parsley, thyme, and dill)
- 4 cloves
- 2 bay leaves
- 1/4 teaspoon grated nutmeg
- 1 green onion, sliced
- 1 salmon liver, finely chopped
- 1 cup mushrooms, sliced
- 2 tablespoons flour
- 2 tablespoons capers
- 6 oysters
- Lemon juice for serving

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F).
2. Place the salmon slices in a covered oven-safe dish.
3. In a bowl, mix together the white wine, fish broth, verjuice (or lemon juice), salt, and pepper.
4. Pour the wine mixture over the salmon slices.
5. Add the fresh herbs, cloves, bay leaves, grated nutmeg, and green onion to the dish.
6. Cover the dish with a lid or aluminum foil.
7. Bake the salmon in the preheated oven for about 20-25 minutes, or until cooked through.
8. While the salmon is baking, prepare the ragout sauce.
9. In a separate pan, heat some oil or butter over medium heat.
10. Add the finely chopped salmon liver to the pan and cook until browned.
11. Add the sliced mushrooms to the pan and cook until they release their moisture and start to brown.
12. Sprinkle the flour over the liver and mushrooms, stirring well to coat.
13. Cook the flour for a minute or two to remove the raw taste.
14. Add the capers and oysters to the pan and cook for another minute.
15. Pour the ragout sauce over the baked salmon slices.
16. Squeeze some fresh lemon juice over the dish before serving.
