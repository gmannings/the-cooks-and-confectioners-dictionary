Salop is a warm, thickened drink made from a mixture of water and salop powder. It was a popular beverage in the 18th century and was often flavored with orange-flower water, rose water, or canary (a type of fortified wine). Lemon juice and sugar can also be added for additional flavor.

4. Remove the saucepan from heat.
5. Stir in orange-flower water or rose water, adjusting the amount to taste.
6. If desired, add canary or fortified wine to taste.
