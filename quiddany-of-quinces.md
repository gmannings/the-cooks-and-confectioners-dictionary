# Quiddany of Quinces

## Description
Quiddany of Quinces is a sweet jelly-like preserve made from quinces. It was a popular dessert in the 18th century.

## Options and commentary
- You can adjust the amount of sugar according to your taste preference.
- This recipe can be easily scaled up or down depending on the quantity of quinces you have.

## Ingredients:
- 1 quart (946 ml) quince liquor (quince juice or water can be used as a substitute)
- 1 pound (454 g) preserved quinces
- 1 pound (454 g) raw quinces, peeled and cored
- 1 pound (454 g) sugar

## Instructions:
1. In a large saucepan, combine the quince liquor, preserved quinces, and raw quinces.
2. Bring the mixture to a boil over medium heat.
3. Reduce the heat to low and simmer the mixture for about 1 hour, or until the quinces are soft and tender.
4. Remove the saucepan from the heat and let the mixture cool slightly.
5. Using a blender or food processor, puree the mixture until smooth.
6. Return the pureed mixture to the saucepan and add the sugar.
7. Place the saucepan back on the stove over medium heat and bring the mixture to a boil.
8. Stir the mixture constantly to dissolve the sugar and prevent it from sticking to the bottom of the pan.
9. Continue boiling the mixture until it reaches the desired consistency. To test the consistency, you can use the "knife point test" mentioned in the original recipe. Dip a knife into the mixture and if it coats the knife and stands up like jelly, it is ready.
10. Once the quiddany has reached the desired consistency, remove the saucepan from the heat.
11. Let the quiddany cool completely before transferring it to sterilized jars for storage.
