# Cheesecakes

## Description
Cheesecakes are a delicious dessert made with a creamy, sweet filling baked in a pastry crust. This recipe from the 18th century uses a custard-like filling made with eggs, flour, cream, butter, and flavored with salt, sugar, cinnamon, and currants.

## Options and commentary
- You can use any type of pastry crust for the cheesecakes, such as shortcrust or graham cracker crust.
- If you prefer a smoother texture, you can strain the custard mixture before pouring it into the crust.
- Feel free to adjust the amount of sugar, cinnamon, and currants to suit your taste.
- You can also add other flavorings such as vanilla extract or lemon zest for extra flavor.
