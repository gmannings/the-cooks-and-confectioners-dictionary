# Modernized Recipe: Mutton Shoulder with Herbs and Lemon

## Description
This recipe is a modernized version of an 18th-century dish called "Another Way." It features a shoulder of mutton that is stripped of its skin, minced, and cooked with a flavorful mixture of herbs, lemon, and broth. The dish can be either fried or stewed, and is finished with a touch of lemon juice or gravy before serving.

## Options and commentary
- You can choose to either fry or stew the minced mutton. Frying will result in a crispy texture, while stewing will yield a more tender and moist dish.
- The skin of the mutton can be breaded or colored for added visual appeal.
- You can use either lemon juice or good quality gravy to enhance the flavor of the dish.

## Ingredients:
- 1 shoulder of mutton, skin removed
- Lard or cooking oil
- Salt and pepper to taste
- 1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg
- 1 cup broth (beef or vegetable)
- 4-5 whole shallots, peeled
- 4-5 mushrooms, sliced
- 1 green lemon (unripe lemon), sliced
- 1 tablespoon chopped fresh herbs (such as parsley, thyme, or rosemary)
- Lemon juice or good quality gravy for serving

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F) if you choose to bake the dish at the end.
2. Strip off the skin of the shoulder of mutton, ensuring that it hangs to the knuckle. Set the skin aside for later use if desired.
3. Mince the mutton flesh into small pieces.
4. Heat a large pan over medium heat and add lard or cooking oil.
5. Add the minced mutton to the pan and season with salt, pepper, and ground nutmeg. Cook until browned and cooked through.
6. Add the broth, whole shallots, sliced mushrooms, green lemon slices, and chopped fresh herbs to the pan. Stir to combine.
7. Option 1: If frying, continue cooking the mixture over medium heat until the flavors meld together and the shallots and mushrooms are tender.
8. Option 2: If stewing, cover the pan with a lid and simmer over low heat for about 1 hour or until the flavors meld together and the shallots and mushrooms are tender.
9. While the mutton mixture is cooking, you can choose to bread or color the reserved mutton skin. If breading, dip the skin in beaten egg and then coat with breadcrumbs. If coloring, brush the skin with a mixture of melted butter and food coloring.
10. Once the mutton mixture is cooked, remove it from the heat and transfer it to a serving dish.
11. If you breaded the mutton skin, place it on a baking sheet and bake in the preheated oven for about 10-15 minutes or until crispy and golden brown.
12. If you colored the mutton skin, simply place it on top of the cooked mutton mixture in the serving dish.
13. Just before serving, drizzle the dish with lemon juice or good quality gravy to enhance the flavors.
14. Serve the mutton shoulder with herbs and lemon hot, accompanied by your choice of side dishes.
