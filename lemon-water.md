# Lemon-water

## Description
Lemon-water is a refreshing citrus-infused drink that can be enjoyed on its own or used as a base for cocktails. This recipe combines the flavors of lemon peels, wine, brandy, and rosewater to create a flavorful and aromatic beverage.

## Ingredients:
- Peels of 10 lemons
- 1 quart (946 ml) of Canary wine
- 1 quart (946 ml) of brandy
- 1 quart (946 ml) of rosewater
- Double-refined sugar

## Instructions:
1. Start by peeling the lemons, making sure to remove only the outer yellow part of the peel. Avoid the white pith as it can add bitterness to the lemon-water.
2. Place the lemon peels in a large container or jar.
3. Pour the Canary wine and brandy over the lemon peels, making sure to use an equal quantity of each.
4. Allow the mixture to stand and infuse for at least a week, or preferably longer. This will allow the flavors to meld together and create a more intense lemon aroma.
5. After the infusion period, strain the mixture through a cloth or filter it through a brown paper to remove the lemon peels.
6. In a separate container, combine an equal quantity of rosewater with double-refined sugar to make a syrup. The amount of rosewater and sugar should be the same as the quantity of lemon-infused liquid obtained from the previous step.
7. Distill the lemon-infused wine and brandy mixture in a bain-marie (water bath) until it reaches a dryness. This process will help concentrate the flavors and remove excess liquid.
8. Once the distillation is complete, mix the concentrated lemon-infused liquid with the rosewater syrup.
9. Transfer the lemon-water to a bottle or container with a tight-fitting lid and store it in a cool, dark place for future use.
