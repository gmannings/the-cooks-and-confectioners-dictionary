# Roasted Venison Shoulder or Joint

## Description
This recipe is for roasting a shoulder or joint of venison. The meat is larded with large strips of bacon and seasoned with salt, pepper, nutmeg, and cloves. It is then marinated in a mixture of white wine, salt, verjuice (a sour juice made from unripe grapes), bay leaves, lemon slices, and herbs. The venison is then roasted over a gentle fire, basted with its own marinade, and served with a rich sauce made from the drippings, cullis (a thick sauce made from meat stock), white pepper, verjuice or lemon juice, vinegar, and capers.

## Options and commentary
- You can use either a shoulder or another joint of venison for this recipe.
- If you can't find verjuice, you can substitute it with a combination of white wine and lemon juice.
- The cooking time will vary depending on the size of the venison joint, but it is typically around 2-3 hours.

## Ingredients:
- 1 shoulder or joint of venison
- Large lardons of bacon
- Salt
- Pepper
- Nutmeg
- Cloves
- White wine
- Verjuice (or substitute with white wine and lemon juice)
- Bay leaves
- Lemon slices
- Fresh herbs (such as thyme, rosemary, and parsley)
- Cullis (meat stock-based sauce)
- White pepper
- Vinegar
- Capers

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to the appropriate temperature for roasting venison (usually around 180Â°C).
2. Lard the venison by inserting large strips of bacon into the meat. Make sure to evenly distribute the lardons throughout the meat.
3. Season the venison with salt, pepper, nutmeg, and cloves. Use your hands to rub the seasonings into the meat, ensuring it is well coated.
4. In a large bowl, combine white wine, verjuice (or white wine and lemon juice), salt, bay leaves, lemon slices, and a faggot of fresh herbs (tied together with kitchen twine).
5. Place the seasoned venison into the marinade and let it sit for 3-4 hours, turning occasionally to ensure even marination.
6. After marinating, remove the venison from the marinade and pat it dry with paper towels.
7. Spit the venison onto a roasting spit or place it on a roasting rack in a roasting pan.
8. Roast the venison over a gentle fire or in the preheated oven. The cooking time will depend on the size of the joint, but it is typically around 2-3 hours. Baste the venison with its own marinade every 30 minutes to keep it moist and flavorful.
9. While the venison is roasting, prepare the sauce. In a saucepan, combine the drippings from the roasting pan and cullis. Heat the mixture over low heat, stirring constantly, until it thickens and becomes a rich sauce.
10. Season the sauce with white pepper, vinegar, and capers. Adjust the seasoning to taste.
11. Just before serving, pour the sauce over the roasted venison, ensuring it is well coated. Garnish with fresh herbs, if desired.
12. Serve the roasted venison shoulder or joint hot, accompanied by the flavorful sauce.

## Cooking time
Approximately 2-3 hours, depending on the size of the venison joint.
