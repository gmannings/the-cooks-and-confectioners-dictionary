# Fried Tongue with Spiced Broth and Grapes

## Description
This recipe is for a dish made with boiled tongue that is sliced and fried in butter. It is then served with a flavorful broth made with strong broth, spices, and grapes. The dish is garnished with sippets (small pieces of toasted bread).

## Options and commentary
- Instead of pork tongue, you can use beef tongue or chicken tongue.
- If you prefer a vegetarian version, you can substitute the tongue with seitan or tofu.
- The spiced broth can be adjusted to your taste by adding more or less of the spices mentioned.
- You can serve the dish with a side of mashed potatoes or steamed vegetables.

## Ingredients:
- 1 pork tongue (or beef tongue, chicken tongue, seitan, or tofu)
- Butter for frying
- 2 cups strong broth (beef or vegetable)
- Salt to taste
- 1/4 teaspoon grated nutmeg
- 2 egg yolks
- A pinch of saffron
- 4 cloves
- 1/4 teaspoon ground mace
- 2 tablespoons verjuice (or lemon juice)
- 1 cup grapes
- Sippets (small pieces of toasted bread)

## Instructions:
1. Place the pork tongue in a large pot and cover it with water. Bring the water to a boil and let the tongue cook until tender. This may take around 2-3 hours, depending on the size of the tongue. 
2. Once the tongue is tender, remove it from the pot and let it cool. Once cooled, peel off the skin and slice the tongue into thin slices.
3. In a frying pan, melt a generous amount of butter over medium heat. Fry the tongue slices in the butter until they are golden brown on both sides. Remove the tongue slices from the pan and set them aside.
4. In the same frying pan, pour in the strong broth and bring it to a simmer. Add salt, grated nutmeg, saffron, cloves, and ground mace to the broth. Let the broth simmer for about 10 minutes to allow the flavors to meld together.
5. In a small bowl, whisk together the egg yolks and verjuice (or lemon juice). Slowly pour this mixture into the simmering broth, stirring constantly to prevent curdling.
6. Add the grapes to the broth and let them cook for a few minutes until they are slightly softened.
7. Place the fried tongue slices back into the pan with the broth and grapes. Let them simmer in the broth for another 5 minutes to heat through.
8. Toast small pieces of bread until they are crispy. These will be used as sippets to serve the dish.
9. To serve, place the fried tongue slices on a plate and pour the spiced broth and grapes over them. Garnish with the sippets of toasted bread.
