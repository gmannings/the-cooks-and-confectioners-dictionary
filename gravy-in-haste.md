# Gravy in Haste

## Description
Gravy in Haste is a quick and flavorful gravy made with ox-kidney, onions, and herbs. It is a versatile sauce that can be used to enhance the flavor of various dishes.

## Ingredients:
- 1 ox-kidney
- Salt and pepper
- 1 shallot, finely chopped

## Instructions:
1. Cut the ox-kidney into slices and season them generously with salt and pepper.

3. Add enough water to just cover the ox-kidney slices.
4. Add the finely chopped shallot, sliced onion, and unsalted butter to the stew-pan.
5. Tie the fresh herbs together with kitchen twine to form a bouquet garni and add it to the stew-pan.
6. Place the stew-pan on the stove over low heat and let it simmer gently for about 30 minutes, or until the ox-kidney is tender and the flavors have melded together.
7. Remove the bouquet garni from the stew-pan.
8. Using a slotted spoon, transfer the ox-kidney slices, onions, and shallots to a serving dish.
9. Pour the remaining liquid from the stew-pan through a fine-mesh sieve to strain out any solids.
10. Pour the strained liquid over the ox-kidney slices, onions, and shallots in the serving dish to create the gravy.
