# Milk Fritters

## Description
Milk fritters are a sweet and crispy dessert made with a batter of milk, eggs, and flour. They are fried until golden brown and then coated with sugar and orange-flower water for a fragrant and flavorful finish.

## Ingredients:
- 250 ml milk
- 2 eggs
- 75 grams all-purpose flour
- Hogs lard or vegetable oil, for frying
- Sugar, for coating
- Orange-flower water, for sprinkling

## Instructions:
1. In a mixing bowl, whisk together the milk, eggs, and flour until well combined. The batter should be thin and smooth, resembling a thin pancake batter.
2. Heat the hogs lard or vegetable oil in a deep saucepan or frying pan over medium heat. The oil should be hot enough to fry the fritters but not smoking.
3. Using the end of a spoon, carefully drop spoonfuls of the batter into the hot oil. Be cautious to avoid overcrowding the pan.
4. Fry the fritters, turning them occasionally, until they are golden brown and crispy on all sides. This should take about 2-3 minutes per batch.
5. Once cooked, remove the fritters from the oil using a slotted spoon and transfer them to a plate lined with paper towels to drain excess oil.
6. While still warm, sprinkle the fritters generously with sugar, coating them evenly.
7. Drizzle the fritters with orange-flower water for a fragrant touch.
8. Sprinkle the fritters with more sugar, ensuring they are well coated.
9. To create a caramelized effect, carefully hold a red-hot fire-shovel over the fritters, allowing the heat to melt and slightly caramelize the sugar.
10. Serve the milk fritters warm and enjoy!
