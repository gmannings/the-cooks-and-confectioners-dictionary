# Hare Stew (French Style)

## Description
This recipe is a modernized version of an 18th-century French recipe for stewed hare. The hare is cooked slowly in a mixture of veal or pork, onions, and broth, resulting in a rich and flavorful dish.

## Options and commentary
- Instead of hare, you can use rabbit or even chicken as a substitute.
- If you prefer a thicker stew, you can add a roux or cornstarch slurry to thicken the sauce.
- Serve the stew with mashed potatoes or crusty bread to soak up the delicious sauce.

## Ingredients:
- 1 hare (or rabbit or chicken), cut into serving pieces
- 200g veal or pork, sliced into 2cm thick pieces
- 2 onions, sliced
- 2 tablespoons lard or cooking oil
- 500ml beef broth
- 2 slices of bread, toasted
- 6 chicken livers
- Salt, to taste
- 1 teaspoon long pepper (or black pepper)
- 1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg
- 1/2 teaspoon ground cloves
- 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
- 100ml red wine (such as Claret)
- 2 tablespoons vinegar

## Instructions:
1. In a large pot or Dutch oven, heat the lard or cooking oil over medium heat. Add the sliced onions and cook until they are golden brown and caramelized.
2. Add the veal or pork slices to the pot and brown them on both sides. Remove the meat and onions from the pot and set aside.
3. In the same pot, add the hare pieces and brown them on all sides. Remove the hare from the pot and set aside.
4. Pour the beef broth into the pot, scraping the bottom to release any browned bits. Return the veal or pork, onions, and hare to the pot.
5. Reduce the heat to low and cover the pot. Let the stew simmer gently for about 2 hours, or until the meat is tender. If the liquid reduces too much, add more beef broth as needed.
6. While the stew is simmering, parboil the chicken livers in a separate pot of beef broth for about 5 minutes. Drain the livers and set aside.
7. In a small saucepan, combine the red wine, vinegar, salt, long pepper, nutmeg, cloves, and cinnamon. Heat the mixture over low heat until it is warm.
8. Place the toasted bread slices in a bowl and pour the warm wine and spice mixture over them. Let the bread soak for a few minutes.
9. Remove the bread from the liquid and place it in a blender or food processor. Add the parboiled chicken livers and blend until smooth.
10. Strain the liver and spice mixture through a fine-mesh sieve, pressing on the solids to extract as much liquid as possible. Discard the solids.
11. When the hare is tender, pour the liver and spice mixture into the pot. Stir well to combine and let the stew simmer for an additional 10 minutes.
12. Taste the stew and adjust the seasoning with salt if needed.
13. Serve the hare stew hot, garnished with fresh herbs if desired.
