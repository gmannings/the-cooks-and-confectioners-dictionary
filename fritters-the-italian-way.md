# Fritters the Italian Way

## Description
These fritters are made with a mixture of rice, cheese, eggs, bread, sugar, and musk. They are then shaped into balls and fried until golden. The fritters are served with a drizzle of orange juice and sugar on top, and garnished with stock-fritters.

## Options and commentary
- You can add different colors to the fritters by using flower petals such as marigolds, violets, blue-bottles, and pinks or carnations. These flowers should be finely crushed and mixed into the dough.
- If the dough is too soft to shape into balls, you can add more grated bread and flour to stiffen it up.

## Ingredients:
- 250g rice
- 500ml cream
- 250g grated cheese
- 4-5 hard-boiled egg yolks
- 100g grated bread
- 50g sugar
- A pinch of musk
- Flower petals (marigolds, violets, blue-bottles, pinks or carnations), crushed (optional)
- Oil for frying
- Juice of oranges
- Sugar for sprinkling
- Stock-fritters for garnish

## Instructions:
1. In a saucepan, bring the cream to a boil.
2. Add the rice to the boiling cream and cook until the mixture thickens, stirring occasionally.
3. Spread the cooked rice mixture onto a dish and let it cool.
4. Once cooled, transfer the rice mixture to a wooden or stone mortar.
5. Add the grated cheese, hard-boiled egg yolks, grated bread, sugar, and musk to the mortar.
6. If desired, add the crushed flower petals to the mortar and mix everything together.
7. Use a pestle to pound and mix the ingredients in the mortar until well combined and the mixture becomes a stiff paste.
8. Shape the paste into small balls using your hands.
9. If the paste is too soft to shape, add more grated bread and flour to stiffen it up.
10. Heat oil in a deep frying pan or pot.
11. Fry the fritters in the hot oil until they turn golden brown on all sides.
12. Remove the fritters from the oil and place them on a paper towel-lined plate to drain excess oil.
13. In a separate bowl, mix the juice of oranges with sugar to create a sweet citrus sauce.
14. Drizzle the orange juice mixture over the fried fritters.
15. Sprinkle some sugar on top of the fritters.
16. Garnish the fritters with stock-fritters.
17. Serve the fritters warm.
