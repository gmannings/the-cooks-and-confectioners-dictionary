## Ingredients:
- 1 kg ripe peaches

## Instructions:
1. Bring a large pot of water to a boil.
2. While the water is heating, prepare an ice bath by filling a large bowl with cold water and ice cubes.
3. Cut a small "X" on the bottom of each peach.
4. Carefully lower the peaches into the boiling water and blanch them for about 30 seconds.
5. Using a slotted spoon, transfer the peaches to the ice bath to cool and stop the cooking process.
6. Once the peaches are cool, peel off the skin and cut them in half. Remove the pits.
7. In a large saucepan, bring enough water to cover the peaches to a boil.
8. Add the peach halves to the boiling water and cook for 1-2 minutes, or until they rise to the top.
9. Using a slotted spoon, transfer the peaches to a bowl of cold water to cool.

12. Skim off any foam that rises to the surface.
13. Add the drained peaches to the syrup and simmer for about 10 minutes, or until the peaches are tender.
14. Remove the peaches from the syrup and place them on a wire rack to drain.
15. Meanwhile, continue boiling the syrup until it reaches a smooth, thick consistency.
16. Return the peaches to the syrup and simmer for another 5 minutes.
17. Remove the peaches from the syrup and place them on a wire rack to drain.
18. In a clean saucepan, bring the syrup to a boil again, adding more sugar if desired.
19. Return the peaches to the syrup and simmer for 5 minutes, or until the syrup has a pearl-like consistency.
