# Braised Calf's Liver

## Description
This recipe is for a traditional 18th-century dish called "Dzels a Calf's Liver, a la Braife." It involves braising the calf's liver with a variety of flavorful ingredients and serving it with a rich sauce. The liver is cooked until tender and then topped with a ragout made from mushrooms, artichoke bottoms, asparagus tops, cockscombs, and veal sweetbreads. This dish can be served as a first course or as a main course.

## Options and commentary
- Instead of larding the liver with lardons, you can use thin strips of bacon to add flavor and moisture to the liver.
- The seafoning mentioned in the recipe can include a combination of salt, pepper, and spices like nutmeg, cloves, or allspice.
- The root vegetables mentioned can be parsnips, carrots, and parsley root.
- For the ragout, you can use a combination of mushrooms, artichoke bottoms, asparagus tops, cockscombs, and veal sweetbreads. If any of these ingredients are not available, you can omit them or substitute with other vegetables or proteins of your choice.
- The sauce can be thickened with a cullis made from veal and ham. If you don't have cullis, you can use a combination of veal or chicken stock and a roux made from butter and flour.
- The liver can also be served with slices of ham prepared separately. The ham can be sweated in a stewpan and then simmered with gravy and thickened with a cullis made from partridges or other game birds.
- Alternatively, the liver can be served with a ragout of succory (chicory) or cucumbers, or with a hashed sauce.
