# Modernized Mince Pie

## Description
This recipe is for a modernized version of an 18th-century mince pie. It is a sweet and savory pie filled with a mixture of minced beef, suet, currants, and spices. The pie is baked until golden and then served with a drizzle of Sack (a fortified wine) and orange juice.

## Options and commentary
- You can use ground beef instead of mincing it yourself.
- If you prefer a vegetarian version, you can substitute the beef with a meat alternative or additional vegetables.
- Feel free to adjust the spices and sweetness to your taste.

## Ingredients:
- 1 pound ground beef
- 1/2 cup suet (or vegetable shortening for a vegetarian version)
- 1 cup currants
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
- 1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg
- 1/4 cup sugar
- 1 pre-made pie crust
- 1/4 cup Sack (fortified wine)
- Juice of 1 orange

## Instructions:
1. Preheat your oven to 180°C (350°F).
2. In a large mixing bowl, combine the ground beef, suet, currants, salt, cinnamon, nutmeg, and sugar. Mix well until all the ingredients are evenly distributed.
3. Roll out the pre-made pie crust and line a pie dish with it.
4. Spoon the mince mixture into the pie crust, spreading it evenly.
5. Cover the pie with another layer of pie crust, sealing the edges by crimping them together.
6. Use a sharp knife to make a few small slits on the top crust to allow steam to escape during baking.
7. Place the pie in the preheated oven and bake for approximately 45 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown.
8. Remove the pie from the oven and let it cool for a few minutes.
9. In a small bowl, mix together the Sack and orange juice.
10. Once the pie has cooled slightly, drizzle the Sack and orange juice mixture over the top.
11. Serve the mince pie warm or at room temperature.
