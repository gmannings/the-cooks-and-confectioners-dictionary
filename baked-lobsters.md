# Baked Lobsters

## Description
Baked lobsters are a delicious and flavorful dish made with cooked lobster meat seasoned with a blend of spices and baked in a pie crust. The dish is then topped with a mixture of butter, white wine, and sugar, and served hot.

## Ingredients:
- 2 lobsters
- Salt
- Pepper
- Ginger
- Nutmeg
- Cinnamon
- 1 pie crust
- 2-3 blades of mace
- 4-5 dates, sliced
- 1 lemon, sliced
- 2 hard-boiled egg yolks, sliced
- 1/4 cup barberries (optional)
- 2 tablespoons butter
- 1/4 cup white wine
- 1 tablespoon sugar

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F).
2. Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Add the lobsters and cook for about 10 minutes until they are fully cooked. Remove the lobsters from the pot and let them cool.
3. Once the lobsters are cool, remove the meat from the shells. Chop the lobster meat into bite-sized pieces.
4. In a bowl, combine the lobster meat with salt, pepper, ginger, nutmeg, and cinnamon. Mix well to evenly coat the lobster meat with the spices.
5. Roll out the pie crust and line a pie dish with it. Place the seasoned lobster meat in the pie crust.
6. Sprinkle the mace blades, sliced dates, lemon slices, hard-boiled egg yolks, and barberries (if using) over the lobster meat.
7. Cover the pie with another layer of pie crust and seal the edges. Make a few small slits on the top crust to allow steam to escape.
8. Place the pie in the preheated oven and bake for about 30-40 minutes until the crust is golden brown.
9. While the pie is baking, prepare the glaze. In a small saucepan, melt the butter over low heat. Add the white wine and sugar, and stir until the sugar is dissolved.
10. Once the pie is baked, remove it from the oven and pour the glaze mixture over the top. Return the pie to the oven for an additional 5 minutes to allow the glaze to set.
11. Remove the pie from the oven and let it cool for a few minutes before serving.
