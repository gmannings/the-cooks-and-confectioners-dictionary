# Cabbage Cream

## Description
Cabbage Cream is a traditional 18th-century dessert made from milk and cream. It is a layered dessert resembling a cabbage, with each layer consisting of cream and milk. The dessert is flavored with rosewater, musk, sugar, and nutmeg.

## Ingredients:
- 1 gallon (3.8 liters) of milk
- Rosewater
- Musk (optional)
- Fine sugar
- Grated nutmeg
- Loaf sugar (for serving)

## Instructions:
1. In a large pot, heat the milk over medium heat until it starts to froth. Skim off the froth as it rises and discard.
2. Once the milk has stopped frothing, carefully pour it into eight or ten bowls, making sure not to create any additional froth.
3. Place the bowls in a location where there is a gentle breeze, allowing them to cool down.
4. Once the milk in the bowls has cooled to a lukewarm temperature, use your hands to gather the cream that has formed on the surface. Crumple the cream together and place it on a plate.
5. Repeat step 4, layering the cream on top of each other until you have four or five layers.
6. Wet a feather with rosewater and musk (if using) and gently stroke it over the layers of cream.
7. Sprinkle fine sugar and grated nutmeg over the cream layers.
8. Repeat steps 2-7, boiling the remaining milk and distributing it into bowls as before. Continue layering the cream, rosewater, musk, sugar, and nutmeg until you have a dessert that resembles a cabbage, with the cream layers stacked on top of each other.
9. Reserve one of the first bowls of cream, as it will be the thickest and most crumpled. Place it on top of the stacked cream layers as the final layer.
10. When serving, scrape loaf sugar over the top of the dessert for added sweetness.

## Cooking time
Approximately 2-3 hours (including cooling time)
