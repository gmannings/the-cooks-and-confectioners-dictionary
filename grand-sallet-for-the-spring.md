## Instructions:
1. Prepare all the vegetables and herbs by washing them thoroughly and patting them dry.
2. Parboil the raisins and currants by placing them in a small saucepan with enough water to cover them. Bring to a boil, then remove from heat and drain.
3. Blanch the almonds by placing them in a heatproof bowl and pouring boiling water over them. Let them sit for a few minutes, then drain and remove the skins.
4. Prepare the pickles by draining and rinsing them if they are store-bought. If making homemade pickles, follow your chosen recipe.
5. Prepare the standard for the salad by carving a castle shape out of a turnip or other hard vegetable. Set aside.
6. Preheat the oven according to the instructions for your pastry dough.
7. Roll out the pastry dough and use it to create the castle shape. Make sure to leave an opening in the center for the tree.
8. In a small bowl, beat the egg yolks. Brush the pastry castle with the egg wash.
9. Create the tree by shaping green herbs into a tree-like form and placing it inside the castle. Use toothpicks if necessary to secure it.
10. Use more green herbs to color the tree and decorate it with flowers.
11. Attach the twelve supporters to the castle by gently pressing them against the sides.
12. Create four rings of pastry dough, each slightly larger than the previous one.
13. Place the largest ring on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Place the castle in the center of the ring.
14. Place the second ring inside the first, leaving a small gap between them. Repeat with the remaining rings, creating a tiered effect.
15. Arrange one type of salad on the topmost ring, and continue to layer different types of salad on each subsequent ring until you reach the dish.
16. Arrange the pickles around the edge of the dish, each type separately.
17. Garnish the dish with additional herbs, flowers, or other decorative elements.
18. Serve the grand sallet immediately and enjoy!
