# Kidney Palty

## Description
Kidney Palty is a savory pastry dish made with minced veal kidney, fat, and meat, flavored with herbs and spices, and encased in puff pastry. It is then fried until golden and crispy.

## Options and commentary
- Instead of veal kidney, you can use beef kidney or lamb kidney.
- If you prefer a lighter version, you can bake the pastries in the oven instead of frying them.
- Serve the Kidney Palty as an appetizer or as a main course with a side salad.

## Ingredients:
- 1 veal kidney (or beef kidney or lamb kidney)
- Fat from the veal kidney
- Some of the veal meat
- Marrow from half a dozen veal marrow bones, chilled
- 1 teaspoon dried marjoram
- 1 teaspoon dried thyme
- 1 teaspoon dried winter savory
- 60 ml rose water
- 6 egg yolks
- 1/2 teaspoon sliced nutmeg
- 225 g sugar
- 225 g currants
- Puff pastry
- Butter or suet for frying

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F) if baking the pastries or heat a large frying pan over medium heat if frying.
2. Remove the veal kidney from the veal loin and trim off any excess fat. Cut the kidney into small pieces.
3. In a food processor, combine the veal kidney, fat, and some of the veal meat. Pulse until finely minced.
4. In a mixing bowl, combine the minced kidney mixture with the chilled veal marrow, dried marjoram, dried thyme, dried winter savory, rose water, egg yolks, sliced nutmeg, sugar, and currants. Mix well until all the ingredients are evenly incorporated.
5. Roll out the puff pastry on a lightly floured surface to a thickness of about 1/4 inch. Cut out small circles or squares, depending on your preference.
6. Spoon a small amount of the kidney mixture onto the center of each pastry circle or square. Fold the pastry over to form a half-moon shape and press the edges together to seal.
7. If baking, place the pastries on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper and bake for about 20-25 minutes, or until the pastry is golden brown and crispy.
8. If frying, melt butter or heat suet in the frying pan. Add the pastries and fry until golden brown on both sides, about 3-4 minutes per side. Remove from the pan and drain on paper towels.
9. Serve the Kidney Palty hot as an appetizer or main course.
