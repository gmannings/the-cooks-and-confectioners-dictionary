# Gammon of Mutton

## Description
Gammon of Mutton is a traditional dish made with a leg of mutton that is marinated, seasoned, and then smoked before being boiled and served cold. The mutton is first marinated in a mixture of white wine, herbs, and spices, then coated with sage and a mixture of spices. It is then wrapped in the skin of a fresh ham and smoked before being boiled. The resulting dish is a flavorful and tender cold meat that can be sliced and served.
