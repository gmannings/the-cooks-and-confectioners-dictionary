# Jumbals of Almonds

## Description
Jumbals of Almonds are a type of sweet pastry made with a mixture of flour, sugar, almonds, butter, cream, and rosewater. They are baked until golden and have a delicate, crumbly texture.

## Options and commentary
- You can add a pinch of salt to enhance the flavor of the jumbals.
- If you prefer a stronger almond flavor, you can add almond extract in addition to the blanched almonds.
- You can shape the jumbals into small rounds, crescents, or any other desired shape.
