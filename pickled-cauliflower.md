# Pickled Cauliflower

## Description
This recipe is for pickling cauliflower florets in a flavorful vinegar-based brine. The cauliflower is first boiled until tender and then soaked in a pickling liquid made with white wine vinegar, spices, and herbs. The pickled cauliflower can be enjoyed as a tangy and crunchy condiment or added to salads and sandwiches.

## Ingredients:
- 1 head of cauliflower
- Water
- Milk
- 500 ml white wine vinegar
- 1 teaspoon whole white pepper
- 1 bay leaf
- 1/4 nutmeg, cut into quarters
- 4 cloves
- 1/4 teaspoon ground mace

## Instructions:
1. Cut the cauliflower into florets, discarding any tough stems.
2. In a large pot, bring water and milk to a boil. Add the cauliflower florets and cook until tender. This should take about 5-7 minutes.
3. Remove the cauliflower from the pot and let it cool completely.
4. In a separate pot, combine the white wine vinegar, whole white pepper, bay leaf, nutmeg quarters, cloves, and ground mace. Bring the mixture to a boil and let it simmer for 5 minutes.
5. Remove the pot from the heat and let the pickling liquid cool completely.
6. Once the pickling liquid is cooled, place the cauliflower florets in a clean, sterilized jar.
7. Pour the pickling liquid over the cauliflower, making sure all the florets are submerged.
8. Seal the jar tightly and let it sit at room temperature for 3 days to allow the flavors to develop.
9. After 3 days, the pickled cauliflower will be ready to eat.
