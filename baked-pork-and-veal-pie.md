# Baked Pork and Veal Pie

## Description
This recipe is for a baked pie made with layers of pork and veal. It is traditionally eaten cold and can be served as a main dish or as a picnic food. The meat is seasoned with a combination of spices and herbs, and the pie is finished with clarified butter.

## Ingredients:
- 1 pork loin
- 1 veal loin
- 4 cloves
- 1/2 teaspoon ground mace
- 1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg
- 1 teaspoon minced thyme
- 4 hard-boiled eggs, yolks only
- Salt and pepper to taste
- 1 teaspoon minced sage
- Saffron-water or 2 egg yolks
- Clarified butter

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F).
2. Bone the pork loin and cut a portion of it into thin slices or collops.
3. Cut the veal loin into the same size collops as the pork.
4. Using the back of a cleaver, beat the pork and veal slices to flatten them slightly.
5. Season the veal collops with cloves, mace, nutmeg, minced thyme, and the yolks of hard-boiled eggs. Mix well to coat the veal evenly.
6. Season the pork collops with salt, pepper, minced sage, and the yolks of hard-boiled eggs. Mix well to coat the pork evenly.
7. In a baking dish, start by layering a portion of the pork collops, followed by a layer of veal collops. Continue layering until all the meat is used, making sure the first and last layers are pork.
8. Close up the pie by covering it with a pastry crust or a layer of dough. Make sure to seal the edges well.
9. Brush the top of the pie with saffron-water or beaten egg yolks for a golden color.
10. Bake the pie in the preheated oven for about 1 hour or until the crust is golden brown and the meat is cooked through.
11. Once the pie is baked and cooled, fill it with clarified butter. This will help preserve the pie and add flavor.
12. Store the pie in a cool place until ready to serve.
