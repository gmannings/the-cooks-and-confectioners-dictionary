# Weavers with Oysters

## Description
This recipe is for a dish called "Weavers with Oysters" from an 18th-century cookbook. Weavers are a type of fish, and in this recipe, they are cooked in a white wine and fish broth sauce, flavored with spices, lemon, parsley, and onions. The dish is then served with a ragout of oysters, which are cooked in butter, flour, bread crumbs, and their own liquor. 

## Ingredients:
- 4 weaver fish fillets
- 1 cup white wine
- 1 cup fish broth
- 2 tablespoons butter
- Salt and pepper to taste
- Spices (such as paprika, cayenne pepper, or your choice)
- 1 bay leaf
- 2-3 slices of lemon
- A small bunch of parsley
- 2 onions, sliced
- 12-16 oysters
- 1 tablespoon flour
- 1 cup bread crumbs
- Chives, chopped (for garnish)

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F).
2. Rinse the weaver fish fillets under cold water and pat them dry with a cloth.
3. In a saucepan, combine the white wine, fish broth, and butter. Season with salt, pepper, and spices of your choice.
4. Place the weaver fish fillets in the saucepan, along with the bay leaf, lemon slices, parsley, and sliced onions.
5. In another saucepan, melt a tablespoon of butter and add the flour. Stir with a wooden spoon until the mixture turns brown.
6. Add the bread crumbs to the browned butter and flour mixture, stirring well.
7. Open the oysters and place them in a sieve to drain, saving the liquor.
8. In the same saucepan with the browned butter and bread crumbs, add the oysters and cook them for about 5-6 minutes over low heat.
9. Season the oysters with pepper, chopped chives, and parsley. Add some of their own liquor and fish broth to moisten them. Heat them over the fire, but do not let them boil.
10. Meanwhile, let the weaver fish fillets stew in the saucepan for about 15-20 minutes, or until they are cooked through.
11. Once the weaver fish fillets are cooked, remove them from the saucepan and drain them well.
12. Place the weaver fish fillets on a serving dish and pour the oyster ragout over them.
13. Garnish with additional chopped chives, if desired.
