## Ingredients:
- 2 pigeons

- 100g butter
- 2 bay leaves
- 500ml good quality gravy
- Salt and pepper, to taste
- 1/2 teaspoon nutmeg
- 1/2 teaspoon cloves
- 1/2 teaspoon mace
- 2-3 shallots, finely chopped
- 1 sprig thyme
- 1 sprig winter savory
- 1 lemon, zest only
- 1 tablespoon flour
- 1 egg yolk

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 180Â°C.
2. Clean the pigeons thoroughly, removing any feathers and innards. Rinse them under cold water and pat dry with paper towels.
3. Finely chop the parsley, spinach, and sorrel.
4. In a large skillet, melt the butter over medium heat. Add the chopped herbs and cook until wilted. Remove from heat and let it cool.
5. Once the herb mixture is cooled, stuff some of it into the pigeons' craws. Reserve some of the mixture for the sauce.
6. Place the stuffed pigeons in a stew-pan and pour enough gravy over them to cover.
7. Season the pigeons with salt, pepper, nutmeg, cloves, mace, shallots, thyme, winter savory, and lemon zest.
8. In a separate small skillet, brown some butter. Add it to the pigeons in the stew-pan.
9. Cover the stew-pan with a lid and place it in the preheated oven. Cook for about 1 hour or until the pigeons are tender.
10. Once the pigeons are cooked, remove them from the stew-pan and keep them warm.
11. In a small bowl, mix together the flour, egg yolk, and the remaining herb mixture.
12. Return the stew-pan to the stovetop over low heat. Add the flour mixture to the pan and stir well to combine.
13. Cook the sauce for a few minutes until it thickens slightly.
14. Serve the stewed pigeons with the sauce spooned over the top.
