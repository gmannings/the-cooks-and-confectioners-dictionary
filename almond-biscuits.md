# Almond Biscuits

## Description
These almond biscuits are a sweet treat made with a combination of sweet and bitter almonds. They are light and delicate, with a crisp exterior and a soft interior.

## Options and commentary
- You can use almond flour instead of grinding your own almonds.
- If you don't have access to bitter almonds, you can use all sweet almonds.
- You can add a teaspoon of almond extract for extra flavor.
- These biscuits are traditionally baked in a campaign oven, but you can use a regular oven with the temperature adjusted accordingly.

## Ingredients:
- 250g sweet almonds
- 60g bitter almonds (optional)
- 200g powdered sugar
- 2 egg whites

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F) and line baking sheets with parchment paper.
2. Blanch the almonds by placing them in boiling water for a minute, then drain and rinse with cold water. Remove the skins by gently squeezing the almonds between your fingers.
3. Grind the almonds in a food processor or blender until they resemble a fine meal. If using almond flour, skip this step.
4. In a large mixing bowl, combine the ground almonds (or almond flour) with the powdered sugar.
5. In a separate bowl, whisk the egg whites until frothy.
6. Gradually add the frothy egg whites to the almond mixture, stirring with a spatula until well combined. The mixture should come together and form a sticky dough.
7. Using a spoon, drop small portions of the dough onto the prepared baking sheets, spacing them about 2 inches apart. The biscuits should be about the size of a shilling coin (approximately 2 cm in diameter).
8. Place the baking sheets in the preheated oven and bake for about 10-12 minutes, or until the biscuits start to rise and turn golden brown.
9. Once the biscuits have risen and are lightly browned, move the baking sheets to a lower rack in the oven and bake for an additional 5-7 minutes to ensure they are cooked through.
10. Remove the biscuits from the oven and allow them to cool completely on the baking sheets before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely.

## Cooking time
Approximately 20-25 minutes.
