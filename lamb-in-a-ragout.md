# Lamb in a Ragout

## Description
This recipe is for a delicious lamb dish cooked in a rich ragout sauce. The lamb is larded with strips of bacon and then browned before being simmered in a flavorful broth with herbs and mushrooms. The dish is served with a sauce made from fried oysters, flour, and anchovies, and is finished with a squeeze of lemon juice and garnished with fried mushrooms.

## Ingredients:
- 1/4 lamb, cut into four quarters
- 4 strips of bacon
- 2 cups broth (chicken or vegetable)
- Salt and pepper to taste
- 4 cloves
- 1 bunch of fresh herbs (such as thyme, rosemary, and parsley)
- 1 cup mushrooms, sliced
- 8 oysters, fried
- 1 tablespoon flour
- 2 anchovies
- Juice of 1 lemon
- Additional mushrooms for garnish

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F).
2. Cut the lamb into four quarters and lard each piece with strips of bacon.
3. Heat a saucepan over medium heat and add the larded lamb. Toss it around to brown it slightly.
4. Transfer the lamb to an ovenproof pot or stewpan.
5. Pour the broth over the lamb and season with salt, pepper, cloves, and the bunch of fresh herbs.
6. Add the sliced mushrooms to the pot.
7. Cover the pot with a lid and place it in the preheated oven.
8. Cook the lamb for approximately 2 hours, or until it is tender and cooked through.
9. While the lamb is cooking, prepare the sauce. In a separate pan, fry the oysters until they are golden brown. Remove them from the pan and set aside.
10. In the same pan, add the flour and cook it for a minute or two until it is lightly browned.
11. Add the anchovies to the pan and stir them into the flour.
12. Gradually add some of the broth from the lamb pot to the pan, stirring constantly to create a smooth sauce.
13. Once the sauce has thickened, add the fried oysters back into the pan.
14. When the lamb is ready to be served, squeeze the juice of one lemon over it.
15. Garnish the dish with fried mushrooms.
16. Serve the lamb with the ragout sauce on the side.
