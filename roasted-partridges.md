# Roasted Partridges

## Description
This recipe is for roasting partridges and serving them with a flavorful sauce made from bread, onion, lemon, and butter. The partridges are roasted until tender and juicy, and then the sauce is poured over them to enhance their flavor.

## Ingredients:
- 2 partridges
- Salt
- Water
- 1/4 cup grated bread
- 1 whole onion
- 1 lemon, minced
- 2 tablespoons butter

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F).
2. Clean and truss the partridges.
3. Place the partridges on a roasting rack in a roasting pan.
4. Sprinkle salt over the partridges.
5. Roast the partridges in the preheated oven for about 30-40 minutes, or until they are cooked through but still juicy. Baste the partridges with their own juices occasionally during cooking.
6. While the partridges are roasting, prepare the sauce. In a saucepan, combine water, grated bread, and the whole onion. Bring to a boil and let it simmer for about 10 minutes.
7. Remove the onion from the saucepan and discard it.
8. Add the minced lemon and butter to the saucepan. Stir well to combine.
9. Cook the sauce for another 2-3 minutes, until the butter has melted and the sauce has thickened slightly.
10. Once the partridges are cooked, remove them from the oven and let them rest for a few minutes.
11. Place the partridges on a serving platter and pour the sauce over them.
12. Serve the roasted partridges with the sauce.
