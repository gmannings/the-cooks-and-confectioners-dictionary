# Compote of Currants

## Description
A compote of currants is a sweet and tangy dessert made by cooking currants in a sugar syrup. It can be served on its own or used as a topping for various desserts.

## Ingredients:
- 500g currants
- 200g sugar

## Instructions:
1. Rinse the currants and remove any stems or leaves.
2. Place the sugar in a saucepan and add enough water to cover it.
3. Heat the sugar and water over medium heat until it reaches the "blown" stage, which is approximately 115째C (240째F) on a candy thermometer. This is when the sugar syrup forms thin threads when dropped from a spoon.
4. Add the currants to the sugar syrup and bring to a boil.
5. Remove the saucepan from the heat.
6. If the currants are sufficiently coated with the sugar syrup, transfer them to serving dishes. If not, return the saucepan to the heat and boil for a few more minutes.
7. Allow the compote to cool before serving.

## Cooking time
Approximately 15 minutes

# Conserve of Currants

## Description
A conserve of currants is a thick, sweet spread made by cooking currants with sugar. It can be used as a filling for pastries or as a spread on bread or toast.

## Ingredients:
- 500g currants
- 400g sugar

## Instructions:
1. Rinse the currants and remove any stems or leaves.
2. Place the currants in a preserving pan and heat over medium heat to release their juice. Stir occasionally to prevent sticking.
3. Once the currants have released their juice, remove them from the heat and strain them through a sieve to remove any solids.
4. Return the strained juice to the preserving pan and heat over medium heat to reduce and thicken.
5. In a separate saucepan, heat the sugar until it reaches the "cracked" stage, which is approximately 150째C (300째F) on a candy thermometer. This is when the sugar syrup forms hard threads when dropped into cold water.
6. Slowly pour the hot sugar syrup into the thickened currant juice, stirring constantly to combine.
7. Continue cooking the mixture over low heat, stirring frequently, until it reaches a thick, spreadable consistency.
8. Remove the pan from the heat and let the conserve cool slightly.
9. Transfer the conserve to molds or jars and allow it to cool completely before using or storing.

## Cooking time
Approximately 30-45 minutes
