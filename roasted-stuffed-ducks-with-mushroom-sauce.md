# Roasted Stuffed Ducks with Mushroom Sauce

## Description
This recipe is for roasted ducks that are stuffed with a flavorful mixture of veal sweetbreads, mushrooms, truffles, and oysters. The ducks are then roasted until golden and served with a rich mushroom sauce. This dish is perfect for a special occasion or a fancy dinner.

## Ingredients:
- 2 wild ducks
- 200g veal sweetbreads
- 100g mushrooms, finely chopped
- 50g truffles, finely chopped
- 50g oysters, finely chopped
- 1 tablespoon finely chopped fresh herbs (such as thyme, rosemary, and sage)
- 1 tablespoon finely chopped chives
- 1 tablespoon finely chopped parsley
- Salt and pepper, to taste
- 500ml mushroom broth or vegetable broth

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 180Â°C.
2. Clean the wild ducks and remove any excess fat or feathers. Set aside.
3. In a bowl, combine the veal sweetbreads, mushrooms, truffles, oysters, fresh herbs, chives, and parsley. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Mix well to combine.
4. Stuff the ducks with the prepared mixture, making sure to pack it tightly. Use kitchen twine to tie up the ducks securely.
5. Place the stuffed ducks on a roasting rack in a roasting pan. Roast in the preheated oven for about 1 hour or until the ducks are golden brown and cooked through. Baste the ducks with their own juices every 20 minutes.
6. While the ducks are roasting, prepare the mushroom sauce. In a saucepan, heat the mushroom broth over medium heat until hot but not boiling.
7. Once the ducks are cooked, remove them from the oven and transfer them to a serving platter. Let them rest for a few minutes before carving.
8. Pour the hot mushroom broth over the ducks, covering them completely. Serve the ducks hot as a side dish, with the mushroom sauce on the side.

## Cooking time
Approximately 1 hour for roasting the ducks.
