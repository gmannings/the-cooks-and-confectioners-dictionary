## Options and commentary

## Instructions:
1. Pour the milk into a large pot and bring it to a boil over medium heat.
2. Once the milk starts to rise, remove it from the heat and let it sit for a while to allow the cream to separate.

4. Sweeten the cream with sugar or sweetener to taste. Start with a small amount and adjust according to your preference.
5. Add scented waters or flavorings of your choice to enhance the flavor of the cream. Start with a few drops and adjust according to your taste.
