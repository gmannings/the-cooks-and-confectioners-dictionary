# Cream Toast (Pain Perdu)

## Description
Cream Toast, also known as Pain Perdu, is a classic French dish made with slices of bread soaked in a mixture of cream, milk, sugar, and cinnamon, then fried until golden brown. It is a delicious and indulgent breakfast or brunch option.

## Ingredients:
- 450g French rolls (or any crusty bread)
- 240ml cream
- 60ml milk
- Sugar
- Cinnamon
- 3-4 eggs
- Clarified butter

## Instructions:
1. Slice the French rolls into thick slices, about the width of your finger.
2. Crumble and crust the slices to create a textured surface.
3. Arrange the slices in a brass or silver dish.
4. Pour half a pint (240ml) of cream and a quarter of a pint (120ml) of milk over the bread slices.
5. Sprinkle sugar and beaten cinnamon over the bread slices.
6. Turn the slices of bread in the cream mixture to ensure they are evenly soaked. Be careful not to break them.
7. Allow the bread slices to soak until they are tender but still firm enough to be turned without breaking.
8. In a separate bowl, break three or four raw eggs.
9. Dip each soaked slice of bread into the beaten eggs, coating both sides.
10. Heat clarified butter in a frying pan over medium heat.
11. Fry the coated bread slices in the clarified butter until they are a good brown color. Be careful not to burn them or make them black.
12. Remove the fried slices from the pan and drain them well to remove excess butter.
13. Sprinkle a little sugar around the slices for added sweetness.
14. Serve the Cream Toast hot as a second course for breakfast or brunch.
