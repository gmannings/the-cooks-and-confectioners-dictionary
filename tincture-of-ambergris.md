# Tincture of Ambergris

## Description
Tincture of Ambergris is a highly aromatic liquid used for perfuming various items and can also be added to cordials for flavor. It is made by infusing ambergris in spirit of wine (high-proof alcohol) for a period of time.

## Ingredients:
- 1 pint (473 ml) high-proof alcohol (such as vodka or grain alcohol)
- 4 grams musk
- 56 grams ambergris

## Instructions:
1. In a bottle, combine the high-proof alcohol, musk, and ambergris.
2. Close the bottle tightly and shake it gently to mix the ingredients.
3. Place the bottle in a container filled with horse dung. Make sure the bottle is fully submerged.
4. Leave the bottle in the horse dung for two weeks to allow the ingredients to infuse.
5. After two weeks, carefully pour off the infused spirit of wine into a separate bottle for use. 
6. Refill the original bottle with fresh high-proof alcohol to continue infusing the ambergris for future use.
7. The tincture is now ready to use. A drop of this tincture can be added to perfumes or used to flavor cordials.

## Options and commentary
- If ambergris is not available or too expensive, it can be substituted with a synthetic ambergris fragrance oil.
- The tincture can be stored in a cool, dark place for an extended period of time.

## Cooking time
2 weeks (infusing time)
