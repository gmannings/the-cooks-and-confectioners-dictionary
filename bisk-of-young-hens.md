# Bisk of Young Hens

## Description
This recipe is for a rich and flavorful dish called "Bisk" made with young hens. The hens are fried to a golden brown color and then stewed with broth, bacon, beef, cloves, herbs, seasoning, and green citron. The dish is garnished with veal sweetbreads, cockscombs, mushrooms, truffles, and artichoke bottoms. Just before serving, the potage (soup) is marbled with lemon juice and veal cullis. This recipe can also be made with other poultry such as capons, pullets, or quails.

## Options and commentary
- Instead of young hens, you can use chicken or Cornish hens.
- If green citron is not available, you can use lemon zest or lemon slices.
- Veal sweetbreads, cockscombs, mushrooms, truffles, and artichoke bottoms can be difficult to find. You can omit some or all of these garnishes or substitute with other ingredients like roasted vegetables or saut√©ed mushrooms.
- Veal cullis is a rich sauce made from veal stock. If you don't have veal cullis, you can use beef or chicken stock instead.

## Ingredients:
- 2 young hens (or chicken or Cornish hens)
- Vegetable oil, for frying
- 1 liter of good broth (chicken or vegetable)
- 2 slices of lean bacon
- 2 slices of beef
- 1/4 teaspoon of ground cloves
- 1 bunch of fresh herbs (such as thyme, parsley, and bay leaves)
- Salt and pepper, to taste
- Zest of 1 lemon (or green citron)
- Optional garnishes: veal sweetbreads, cockscombs, mushrooms, truffles, artichoke bottoms
- Juice of 1 lemon

## Instructions:
1. Truss the young hens (or chicken or Cornish hens) neatly.

8. Once the hens are cooked, remove them from the pot and keep them warm.
9. Strain the broth from the pot and return it to the pot.
