# Barley Sugar

## Description
Barley Sugar is a type of hard candy made from barley water and caramelized sugar. It has a sweet and slightly nutty flavor, and a hard, brittle texture.

## Ingredients:
- 200g barley
- 1 liter water
- 500g granulated sugar
- Olive oil, for greasing

## Instructions:
1. In a large pot, bring the water to a boil.
2. Add the barley to the boiling water and cook for about 30 minutes, or until the barley is soft.
3. Strain the barley through a fine-mesh sieve, pressing down to extract as much liquid as possible. Discard the cooked barley.
4. Return the barley water to the pot and bring it to a simmer.
5. Gradually add the sugar to the simmering barley water, stirring constantly until the sugar is completely dissolved.
6. Increase the heat to medium-high and continue to cook the mixture, without stirring, until it reaches the caramel stage. This is when the sugar has turned a deep amber color and has reached a temperature of around 170°C (338°F) on a candy thermometer.
7. Remove the pot from the heat and let the boiling settle for a few minutes.
8. Meanwhile, grease a marble or granite surface with a small amount of olive oil.
9. Carefully pour the hot caramelized sugar onto the greased surface, spreading it out into a thin layer using a heat-resistant spatula or the back of a spoon.
10. Allow the caramel to cool and harden for a few minutes until it becomes slightly firm but still pliable.
11. Using a sharp knife, cut the hardened caramel into small pieces or roll it into lengths as desired.
12. Let the barley sugar cool completely before storing it in an airtight container.
