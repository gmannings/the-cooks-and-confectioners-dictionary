# Cream Rice Pudding

## Description
Cream Rice Pudding is a delicious and creamy dessert made with rice, cream, eggs, and spices. It has a smooth texture and is flavored with ginger, cinnamon, and mace. The addition of currants adds a burst of sweetness to the pudding. This recipe can be baked in a pastry crust or in a dish or pan.

## Ingredients:
- 1 quart (946 ml) cream
- 2 ounces (56 grams) pickled rice
- Sugar, to taste
- 1 teaspoon ginger
- 1 teaspoon cinnamon
- 1/2 teaspoon mace
- 8 egg yolks
- 2 egg whites
- 2 ounces (56 grams) currants, picked and washed
- Pinch of salt
- Sugar, for garnish
- Comfits, orange slices, or cinnamon sticks, for garnish

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 350°F (175°C).

2. In a large saucepan, bring the cream to a boil.

3. Add the pickled rice, sugar, ginger, cinnamon, and mace to the boiling cream. Stir well.

4. Reduce the heat to low and simmer the mixture until the rice is cooked and the cream has thickened slightly. This should take about 20-25 minutes. Stir occasionally to prevent sticking.

5. Remove the saucepan from the heat and let the mixture cool until it is cold.

6. In a separate bowl, beat the egg yolks and egg whites together until well combined.

7. Strain the cooled cream mixture into the beaten eggs, stirring constantly to prevent curdling.

8. Add the picked and washed currants and a pinch of salt to the mixture. Stir well to combine.

9. Pour the pudding mixture into a pastry crust or a greased baking dish or pan.

10. Bake the pudding in the preheated oven for about 40-45 minutes, or until the top is golden brown and the pudding is set.

11. Remove the pudding from the oven and let it cool slightly.

12. Garnish the pudding with sugar and your choice of comfits, orange slices, or cinnamon sticks.

13. Serve the Cream Rice Pudding warm or chilled.
