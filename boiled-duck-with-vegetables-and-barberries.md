# Boiled Duck with Vegetables and Barberries

## Description
This recipe is for a boiled duck dish that is flavored with onions, parsley, turnips, endive, and barberries. The duck is parboiled before being cooked in a flavorful broth with the vegetables and barberries. The dish is finished with butter, verjuice (a sour juice made from unripe fruit), and a combination of spices. The result is a tender and flavorful duck dish with a hint of sweetness from the barberries.

## Ingredients:
- 1 tame duck
- 1 onion, chopped
- 1 handful of parsley, chopped
- 500 ml strong mutton broth
- 1 turnip, cut into pieces and parboiled
- 1 endive, washed and chopped
- 100 g barberries, picked and washed
- 225 g butter
- 30 ml verjuice
- 1/2 teaspoon large mace
- 1/2 teaspoon pepper
- 1 teaspoon sugar

## Instructions:
1. Parboil the duck by placing it in a large pot of boiling water and cooking it for about 10 minutes. This will help remove any excess fat and impurities from the duck.
2. Remove the duck from the pot and set it aside.
3. In a pipkin or a large saucepan, combine the chopped onion and parsley.
4. Add the strong mutton broth to the pipkin.
5. Add the parboiled turnip, chopped endive, and washed barberries to the pipkin.
6. Place the pipkin over medium heat and bring the mixture to a boil.
7. Reduce the heat to low and let the mixture simmer for about 30 minutes, or until the vegetables are tender.
8. Add the butter and verjuice to the pipkin.
9. Stir the mixture continuously until the butter has melted and everything is well combined.
10. Season the mixture with the large mace, pepper, and sugar. Adjust the seasoning to taste.
11. Continue cooking the mixture, stirring occasionally, until it reaches the desired consistency.
12. Once the mixture is ready, remove it from the heat.
13. Serve the boiled duck with the vegetables and barberries, spooning the flavorful broth over the top.
