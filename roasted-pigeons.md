# Roasted Pigeons

## Description
This recipe is for roasting pigeons and stuffing them with a flavorful mixture of minced pigeon livers, beef suet or marrow, grated bread, minced hard-boiled eggs, salt, nutmeg, mace, and thyme. The pigeons are then roasted on a spit and served with a rich gravy made from the pan drippings, claret, sliced nutmeg, raw egg yolk, butter, and minced lemon.

## Ingredients:
- 4 pigeons
- 4 pigeon livers
- 100g beef suet or marrow
- 50g grated bread
- 2 hard-boiled eggs, yolks minced
- Salt, to taste
- Nutmeg, to taste
- Mace, to taste
- Tops of thyme, shredded
- 100ml verjuice (or substitute with white wine vinegar)
- 200ml claret (or substitute with red wine)
- 1/2 lemon, minced
- 1 raw egg yolk
- 50g butter

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 180Â°C.
2. Prepare the pigeons by trussing them.
3. In a bowl, combine the minced pigeon livers, beef suet or marrow, grated bread, minced hard-boiled egg yolks, salt, nutmeg, mace, and shredded thyme.
4. Mix in the verjuice (or white wine vinegar) to bind the stuffing mixture together.
5. Cut the skin of each pigeon between the legs and body, being careful not to break the skin.
6. Gently lift the skin from the flesh using your fingers, creating a pocket without detaching the skin.
7. Stuff the pigeons with the prepared mixture, making sure to fill the pocket evenly.
8. Truss the legs of each pigeon tightly to secure the stuffing inside.
9. Spit the pigeons onto a roasting spit and place them in the preheated oven.
10. Roast the pigeons for about 20-25 minutes, or until the skin is golden brown and the meat is cooked through. Baste occasionally with the pan drippings.
11. While the pigeons are roasting, prepare the gravy. In a saucepan, combine the reserved gravy from the roasting pan, claret (or red wine), sliced nutmeg, and a small amount of the stuffing mixture.
12. Simmer the gravy over low heat for 10-15 minutes, allowing the flavors to meld together.
13. In a separate bowl, beat the raw egg yolk and butter together until well combined.
14. Stir in the minced lemon.
15. Gradually add the thickened gravy to the egg yolk and butter mixture, whisking constantly to prevent curdling.
16. Once all the gravy is incorporated, return the mixture to the saucepan and heat gently until thickened.
17. Remove the roasted pigeons from the oven and let them rest for a few minutes.
18. Serve the pigeons with the thickened gravy on the side.

## Cooking time
Approximately 20-25 minutes for roasting the pigeons.
