# Veal Pasty

## Description
A veal pasty is a savory pie made with a flaky pastry crust and filled with seasoned veal, spices, and lemon. It is baked until golden and served with a rich white wine and butter sauce.

## Options and commentary
- You can use other types of meat such as chicken or beef instead of veal.
- Feel free to add additional spices or herbs to the filling for extra flavor.
- If you prefer a thicker crust, you can double the quantity of flour in the pastry.

## Ingredients:
- 1 sheet of pastry
- 1 pound (450g) veal, boneless and diced
- Salt and pepper, to taste
- 2 tablespoons butter
- 1 teaspoon whole mace
- 1 lemon, thinly sliced
- 2 tablespoons white wine
- 2 tablespoons butter
- 2 egg yolks
- 1 tablespoon sugar

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F).
2. Roll out the pastry sheet and line a pie dish with it. Set aside.
3. Season the diced veal with salt and pepper.
4. Spread the butter on the bottom of the pastry-lined dish.
5. Place the seasoned veal in the dish.
6. Sprinkle the whole mace over the veal.
7. Arrange the lemon slices on top of the veal.
8. Dot the top with butter.
9. Cover the filling with another layer of pastry and seal the edges.
10. Bake the pasty in the preheated oven for about 45 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown.
11. While the pasty is baking, prepare the sauce. In a small saucepan, heat the white wine and butter over low heat until the butter is melted.
12. In a separate bowl, whisk together the egg yolks and sugar until well combined.
13. Slowly pour the warm wine and butter mixture into the egg yolks, whisking constantly.
14. Return the mixture to the saucepan and cook over low heat, stirring constantly, until the sauce thickens slightly.
15. Once the pasty is cooked, remove it from the oven and cut it into serving portions.
16. Pour the prepared sauce into the pasty, making sure it fills the gaps between the meat and lemon slices.
17. Serve the veal pasty hot, with the sauce poured over each portion.
