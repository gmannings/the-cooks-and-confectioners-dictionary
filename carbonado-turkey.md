## Description

## Options and commentary
- You can use a whole turkey or turkey breast for this recipe.
- Instead of grilling the turkey, you can broil it in the oven.
- Barberries can be substituted with cranberries or currants.
- You can use either orange or lemon for garnish, depending on your preference.

## Ingredients:
- 1 whole turkey or turkey breast
- Butter, for basting
- Salt
- For the sauce:
  - Gravy
  - Strong broth
  - 1 tablespoon drawn butter
  - Salt
  - 1 anchovy, finely chopped
  - 1/4 teaspoon grated nutmeg
  - 1 tablespoon grated bread
- Barberries, cranberries, or currants, for garnish
- Orange or lemon slices, for garnish

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F).
2. Place the turkey on a roasting rack in a roasting pan. Roast the turkey until it is almost cooked through.
3. Remove the turkey from the oven and let it cool slightly. Carve the turkey into thick slices.
4. Using a sharp knife, make long cuts in each slice of turkey, about 1/2 inch apart. Then, make perpendicular cuts to create a checkered pattern.
5. Brush the turkey slices with melted butter and sprinkle with salt.
6. Place the turkey slices on a preheated grill or under the broiler in the oven. Cook until the turkey is nicely browned and grill marks appear, turning it two or three times to cook evenly.
7. While the turkey is grilling, prepare the sauce. In a saucepan, combine the gravy, strong broth, drawn butter, salt, anchovy, grated nutmeg, and grated bread. Bring the sauce to a boil and cook until it thickens slightly.
8. Remove the turkey from the grill or broiler and transfer it to a serving dish.
9. Pour the sauce over the turkey slices, making sure to coat them evenly.
10. Sprinkle the barberries, cranberries, or currants over the turkey slices.
11. Garnish the dish with orange or lemon slices.
12. Serve the Carbonado à Turkey immediately.
