# Stuffed Pigeon Pie

## Description
This recipe is for a traditional 18th-century dish called Stuffed Pigeon Pie. It features pigeons that are stuffed with a flavorful mixture of chopped livers, bacon, marrow, herbs, and mushrooms. The pigeons are then baked in a pastry crust and served with a ragout of veal sweetbreads, cock's combs, and mushrooms.

## Ingredients:
- 4 large pigeons
- 8 slices of bacon
- 4 veal sweetbreads
- 4 cock's combs
- 200g mushrooms
- Fresh herbs (such as parsley and chives)
- Salt and pepper
- Pastry dough for the pie crust

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F).
2. Draw the pigeons and truss them.
3. Beat the pigeons on the breasts to break their bones slightly.
4. Lard the pigeons by inserting large lardons of bacon into the meat.
5. Chop the pigeon livers and raw bacon into small pieces.
6. Finely chop the fresh herbs, mushrooms, and truffles.
7. In a mortar and pestle, pound together the chopped livers, bacon, marrow, herbs, mushrooms, and truffles until well combined.
8. Stuff the bodies of the pigeons with the prepared farce mixture.
9. Roll out the pastry dough and line a pie dish with it.
10. Spread a layer of the farce mixture on the bottom of the pie dish.
11. Season the stuffed pigeons with salt and pepper.
12. Arrange the pigeons in the pie dish, placing a bay leaf on top.
13. Lay thin slices of bacon over the pigeons.
14. Cover the pie with the remaining pastry dough, sealing the edges.
15. Bake the pie in the preheated oven for approximately 1 hour, or until the pastry is golden brown and the pigeons are cooked through.
16. Remove the pie from the oven and let it cool slightly.
17. Cut the pie into slices, removing any excess fat.
18. In a separate pan, prepare a ragout by cooking the veal sweetbreads, cock's combs, and mushrooms with some butter or oil until they are cooked through.
19. Pour the prepared ragout into the pie, filling the cavity left by the removed fat.
20. Serve the Stuffed Pigeon Pie as a side dish at the table.
