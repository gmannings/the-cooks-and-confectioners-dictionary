# Carraway Cake

## Description
Carraway Cake is a traditional 18th-century cake flavored with caraway seeds. It has a rich and buttery texture and is often served as a dessert or with tea.

## Options and commentary
- You can use all-purpose flour as a modern alternative to the "fine flour" mentioned in the recipe.
- Instead of rubbing the butter into the flour, you can use a food processor or a pastry cutter to achieve the same result.
- Rosewater, Canary (a type of fortified wine), and ale yeast may not be readily available in modern kitchens. You can substitute them with vanilla extract, white wine, and active dry yeast respectively.
- Naples-Biskets are a type of biscuit or cookie. You can use ladyfingers or sponge cake as a substitute.
- Carraway-Confects are candied caraway seeds. If you can't find them, you can use regular caraway seeds or omit them altogether.
- The baking time may vary depending on your oven. Keep an eye on the cake and adjust the baking time accordingly.

## Ingredients:
- 500g all-purpose flour
- 680g unsalted butter
- 6 tbsp rosewater
- 240ml white wine (Canary substitute)
- 240ml heavy cream
- 180ml warm water
- 3 tsp active dry yeast (ale yeast substitute)
- 2 large eggs
- 4 egg yolks
- 1 1/2 cups sugar
- 340g ladyfingers or sponge cake (Naples-Biskets substitute)
- 170g candied caraway seeds (Carraway-Confects substitute)
- 170g mixed candied citrus peel (optional)
- Zest of 1 lemon, 1 orange, and 1 lime (optional)

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F).
2. In a large mixing bowl, combine the flour and butter. Rub the butter into the flour until it resembles fine crumbs.
3. In a separate bowl, mix together the rosewater, white wine, heavy cream, warm water, yeast, eggs, and egg yolks.
4. Pour the liquid mixture into the flour and butter mixture. Stir until well combined.
5. Let the batter rest in a warm place for about 30 minutes, or until it has doubled in size.
6. Meanwhile, chop the ladyfingers or sponge cake into small pieces. If using, chop the candied citrus peel as well.
7. Once the batter has risen, add the chopped ladyfingers or sponge cake, candied caraway seeds, and optional candied citrus peel and zest. Mix well.
8. Grease a cake pan or line it with parchment paper. Pour the batter into the pan.
9. Place the cake pan in the preheated oven and bake for approximately 1 hour and 30 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.
10. Remove the cake from the oven and let it cool in the pan for 10 minutes. Then transfer it to a wire rack to cool completely.

## Cooking time
Approximately 1 hour and 30 minutes.
