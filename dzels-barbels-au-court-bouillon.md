# Dzels Barbels au Court Bouillon

## Description
Dzels Barbels au Court Bouillon is a traditional 18th century French dish made with barbel fish cooked in a flavorful court bouillon broth. The fish is poached in a mixture of white wine, verjuice, and various spices, giving it a delicate and aromatic flavor. It is typically served dry on a clean napkin, accompanied by a garnish of parsley or garden cress.

## Ingredients:
- 1 large barbel fish
- Vinegar
- Salt
- 500 ml white wine
- 250 ml verjuice (or substitute with lemon juice)
- Pepper
- Nutmeg
- Cloves
- Bay leaves
- Onion
- Lemon or orange peel
- Parsley or garden cress for garnish

## Instructions:
1. Clean the barbel fish by removing the scales and internal organs. Do not remove the skin.
2. Place the cleaned barbel fish on a dish and pour scalding hot vinegar and salt over it. Let it sit for a few minutes.
3. In a fish pan or large pot, combine the white wine, verjuice (or lemon juice), salt, pepper, nutmeg, cloves, bay leaves, onion, and lemon or orange peel.
4. Place the fish pan on the stove and bring the mixture to a boil over high heat.
5. Once the mixture is boiling rapidly, carefully place the barbel fish into the pan.
6. Reduce the heat to low and let the fish simmer in the court bouillon for about 15-20 minutes, or until it is cooked through and flakes easily with a fork.
7. Carefully remove the cooked barbel fish from the court bouillon and transfer it to a clean napkin or kitchen towel to drain excess liquid.
8. Serve the barbel fish dry on the napkin, replacing the traditional dish of roast meat.
9. Garnish with parsley or garden cress.
