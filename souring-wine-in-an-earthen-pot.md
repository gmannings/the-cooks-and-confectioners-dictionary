## Ingredients:

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F).

4. Roll out the pastry dough into a circle large enough to cover the mouth of the earthen pot.
5. Place the pastry dough over the mouth of the pot, ensuring it forms a tight seal.

8. Boil the pot in the water for 30 minutes.
9. After 30 minutes, remove the pot from the boiling water and allow it to cool.
10. Once cooled, remove the pastry dough seal from the pot.
11. The wine in the pot should now be sour. Transfer it to a clean container for storage or use it immediately in your desired recipe.
