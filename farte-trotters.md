# Farte Trotters

## Description
Farte Trotters is a dish made from boiled and stuffed pig trotters. The trotters are first boiled in broth with herbs, then stuffed with a mixture of veal, bacon, suet, and seasonings. They are then rolled up, browned in the oven, and served with a mushroom sauce.

## Ingredients:
- 4 pig trotters
- 1 liter broth
- 1 bunch chives
- 1 bunch parsley
- 500g veal leg
- 250g fat bacon
- 250g suet
- 1 French roll
- 250ml milk or broth
- Salt and pepper
- 4 eggs
- 1/2 teaspoon nutmeg
- 1 onion
- 1 tablespoon melted suet
- Flour
- 1 shallot
- 250ml mushroom ragout or sauce

## Instructions:
1. Scald the pig trotters to remove any hair. 
2. In a large pot, bring the broth to a boil and add the chives and parsley. 
3. Add the pig trotters to the pot and simmer for about 2 hours, or until the meat is tender. 
4. Remove the trotters from the broth and let them cool slightly. 
5. Cut off the claws and remove the leg bones, leaving the skin intact. 
6. Lay the trotters flat and make a forced-meat stuffing. 
7. In a separate pot, boil the veal leg, bacon, and suet for 30 minutes. 
8. Drain the meat and let it cool in cold water to prevent the bacon from becoming oily when minced. 
9. Mince the veal, bacon, and suet separately until very fine. 
10. Mix the minced meat together in a bowl. 
11. Soak the crumb of the French roll in milk or broth and add it to the minced meat. 
12. Season the mixture with salt, pepper, nutmeg, finely chopped onion, and parsley. 
13. Add the raw eggs to the mixture and mix well. 
14. Spread the forced-meat stuffing onto each trotter, then roll them up tightly. 
15. Sprinkle the rolled trotters with melted suet and dust them with flour. 
16. Place the trotters in a baking dish or pan and brown them in the oven. 
17. Once browned, remove the trotters from the dish and drain any excess fat. 
18. Rub the dish with a shallot to add flavor. 
19. Pour the mushroom ragout or sauce over the trotters in the dish. 
20. Serve the Farte Trotters hot in plates or small dishes.
