# Bolonia Autages

## Description
Bolonia Autages is a traditional 18th-century sausage made from a combination of beef and pork, flavored with herbs and spices. The sausages are then smoked or dried for several days to enhance the flavors and preserve them.

## Options and commentary
- You can use lean beef and pork cuts such as sirloin and loin for a healthier version of the sausage.
- If you prefer a milder flavor, reduce the amount of herbs and spices used.
- Instead of smoking or drying the sausages, you can cook them in a pan or on a grill for a shorter cooking time.

## Ingredients:
- 1.5 kg beef (buttock or sirloin)

6. Add the egg yolks and flour to the mixture. Mix until everything is well combined.
7. Transfer the mixture to a mortar and pound it until it forms a smooth paste.
