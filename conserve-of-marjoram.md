# Conserve of Marjoram

## Description
Conserve of Marjoram is a sweet and fragrant preserve made with fresh marjoram and sugar. It has a thick syrup-like consistency and can be used as a topping for desserts, added to cocktails, or used as a flavoring in various dishes.

## Ingredients:
- 100g fresh marjoram leaves
- 200g fine sugar

## Instructions:
1. Wash the fresh marjoram leaves and pat them dry.
2. Using a wooden mortar and pestle or a bowl and the back of a spoon, bruise the marjoram leaves to release their flavor and aroma.
3. In a saucepan, combine the fine sugar with an equal amount of water. For example, if you have 200g of sugar, add 200ml of water.
4. Place the saucepan over medium heat and bring the sugar-water mixture to a boil, stirring occasionally to dissolve the sugar completely.
5. Once the sugar has dissolved, reduce the heat to low and let the mixture simmer until it reaches a thick syrup-like consistency. This should take about 10-15 minutes.
6. Add the bruised marjoram leaves to the syrup and stir well to combine.
7. Continue to simmer the mixture for another 5 minutes to infuse the marjoram flavor into the syrup.
8. Remove the saucepan from the heat and let the conserve cool completely.
9. Once cooled, transfer the conserve of marjoram to a clean, sterilized jar for storage.

## Cooking time
Approximately 20-25 minutes.
