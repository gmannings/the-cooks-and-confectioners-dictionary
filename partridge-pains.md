# Partridge Pains

## Description
Partridge Pains are a dish made with roasted partridges, chicken or capon meat, bacon, suet, mushrooms, artichoke bottoms, truffles, garlic, sweet herbs, soaked bread crumbs, and egg yolks. The ingredients are seasoned and mixed together to form a thick mixture, which is then shaped into round patties and breaded. The patties are then fried until golden and served as a side dish or used to garnish larger dishes.

## Ingredients:
- 2 roasted partridges
- 1 chicken or capon breast, cooked and shredded
- 100g parboiled bacon, chopped
- 50g suet, diced
- 50g mushrooms, chopped
- 50g artichoke bottoms, chopped
- 25g truffles, chopped
- 1 clove of garlic, minced
- 1 tablespoon fresh herbs (such as parsley, thyme, and rosemary), chopped
- 50g bread crumbs, soaked in gravy
- 2 egg yolks
- Salt and pepper, to taste
- Flour, for coating
- 2 eggs, beaten
- Vegetable oil, for frying

## Instructions:
1. In a large mixing bowl, combine the shredded partridge meat, cooked chicken or capon breast, chopped bacon, diced suet, chopped mushrooms, chopped artichoke bottoms, chopped truffles, minced garlic, and fresh herbs. Mix well to combine.
2. Add the soaked bread crumbs and egg yolks to the mixture. Season with salt and pepper. Mix until all the ingredients are evenly distributed and the mixture holds together.
3. Take a small portion of the mixture and shape it into a round patty, about the thickness of an egg. Repeat with the remaining mixture.
4. Dip the tip of a knife into the beaten eggs and use it to shape the patties, smoothing the edges and giving them a neat appearance.
5. Coat each patty in flour, shaking off any excess.
6. Heat vegetable oil in a frying pan over medium heat. Fry the patties in batches until golden brown on both sides, about 3-4 minutes per side. Remove from the pan and drain on paper towels.
7. Serve the Partridge Pains as a side dish or use them to garnish larger dishes.
