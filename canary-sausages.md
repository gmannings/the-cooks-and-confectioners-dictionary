# Canary Sausages

## Description
Canary sausages are a type of sausage made with pork fat, eggs, spices, and flavorings. They are traditionally stuffed into casings and then cooked. The sausages have a rich and flavorful taste, with hints of nutmeg, cloves, mace, and cinnamon.

## Options and commentary
- Instead of using pork fat, you can use butter or vegetable shortening as a modern alternative.
- If you don't have access to casings, you can shape the sausage mixture into patties and cook them as sausage patties.
- The recipe mentions rinsing the casings in rose water, but this step can be skipped if you don't have rose water available.

## Ingredients:
- 1 pint of Canary wine (or any sweet white wine)
- 4-5 egg yolks
- Salt
- Grated nutmeg
- Ground cloves
- Ground mace
- Ground cinnamon
- Sugar
- 100g of pork fat (or butter/vegetable shortening)
- A few drops of rose water
- Caraway seeds
- Sausage casings (optional)

## Instructions:
1. In a mixing bowl, combine the Canary wine, egg yolks, a pinch of salt, grated nutmeg, ground cloves, ground mace, ground cinnamon, and a sprinkle of sugar. Mix well until all the ingredients are incorporated.
2. In a separate bowl, melt the pork fat (or butter/vegetable shortening) and let it cool slightly.
3. Add the melted fat to the wine and egg mixture. Mix well to combine.
4. Add a few drops of rose water and a sprinkle of caraway seeds to the mixture. Mix again.
5. If using casings, rinse them in rose water to remove any salt or preservatives. Then, fill the casings with the sausage mixture using a sausage stuffer or a piping bag.
6. If not using casings, shape the sausage mixture into patties.
7. Preheat a skillet or grill pan over medium heat. Cook the sausages for about 10-12 minutes, turning occasionally, until they are browned and cooked through.
8. Serve the sausages hot with your choice of accompaniments.

## Cooking time
Approximately 10-12 minutes.
