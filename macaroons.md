# Macaroons

## Description
Macaroons are sweet, chewy cookies made with almonds and sugar. They have a delicate texture and are often flavored with rosewater. This recipe yields a large batch of macaroons.

## Options and commentary
- You can use blanched almonds or almond flour as a modern alternative to whole almonds.
- If you don't have rosewater, you can use vanilla extract or almond extract for flavoring.
- Wafers are not commonly used in modern macaroon recipes. Instead, you can use parchment paper or silicone baking mats to line the baking sheets.

## Ingredients:
- 450g blanched almonds or almond flour
- 675g powdered sugar
- 8 egg whites
- 1 teaspoon rosewater (or vanilla extract or almond extract)

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 160°C (325°F) and line baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone baking mats.
2. In a large bowl, combine the blanched almonds or almond flour with the powdered sugar.
3. In a separate bowl, whisk the egg whites until frothy.
4. Gradually add the egg whites to the almond mixture, stirring well after each addition.
5. Add the rosewater (or vanilla extract or almond extract) and mix until the batter is slightly thicker than fritter batter.
6. Drop spoonfuls of the batter onto the prepared baking sheets, spacing them about 2 inches apart.
7. Bake the macaroons for 12-15 minutes, or until they are lightly golden on the edges.
8. Remove from the oven and let the macaroons cool completely on the baking sheets before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely.
