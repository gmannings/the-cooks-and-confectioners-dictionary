## Ingredients:
- 1 boneless pork loin (approximately 1 kg)

- 1/2 teaspoon black pepper
- 1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg
- 1/2 teaspoon ground cloves
- 1/2 teaspoon dried savory

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F).

3. In a separate bowl, mix together the fresh thyme leaves, sage leaves, and grated lemon zest.
