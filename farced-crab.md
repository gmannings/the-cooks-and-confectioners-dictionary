# Farced Crab

## Description
Farced Crab is a dish made by stuffing the meat of a boiled crab into its shell, along with minced fresh eel and a mixture of seasonings, herbs, eggs, fruits, and vegetables. The stuffed crab is then baked and served with a rich sauce made from butter, white wine, and various garnishes.

## Options and commentary
- Instead of using a whole crab, you can use crab meat that is already cooked and picked.
- If fresh eel is not available, you can substitute it with another mild-flavored fish.
- The choice of fruits and vegetables can vary based on personal preference and availability. Grapes, gooseberries, barberries, boiled artichokes, or asparagus can all be used.
- Almond paste can be made by grinding blanched almonds with a little water or milk until smooth.
- The garnishes can include scalded grapes, gooseberries, or barberries, as well as slices of orange or lemon.
- Pistachios, sliced almonds, pine-apple seeds, or decorative pastry cutouts can be used to garnish the dish.
