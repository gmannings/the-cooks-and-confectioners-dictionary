## Ingredients:
- 2 large veal sweetbreads
- 1 pound (450g) leg of veal
- 1/2 pound (225g) fat bacon
- 1/2 pound (225g) suet
- 1 French roll, soaked in milk or broth
- 4 raw eggs
- Salt and pepper to taste
- 1 small onion, minced
- 1/2 teaspoon nutmeg
- 1/4 cup minced parsley
- Slices of bacon
- Slices of veal
- Salt and pepper to season
- Spices (optional)
- Whole chives
- 1 onion, sliced
- Fresh herbs (such as thyme, rosemary, and bay leaves)
- 10-12 cockscombs
- Melted bacon fat
- Small mushrooms
- Truffles, sliced
- Gravy

## Instructions:
1. Blanch the veal sweetbreads by placing them in hot water for a few minutes. Then transfer them to cold water to cool.
2. Cut the sweetbreads in half lengthwise and make small holes in each piece.
3. Prepare the forcemeat mixture by boiling the leg of veal, fat bacon, and suet together for 30 minutes. Then transfer them to cold water to cool.
4. Mince each ingredient separately until they resemble a paste-like consistency.
5. Combine all the minced ingredients in a stone mortar and add the soaked French roll, raw eggs, salt, pepper, minced onion, nutmeg, and minced parsley. Pound everything together until well combined and forms a paste.
6. Stuff the sweetbreads with the forcemeat mixture.
7. In a stewpan, layer slices of bacon and veal on the bottom. Season with salt, pepper, spices (if desired), minced parsley, whole chives, sliced onion, and fresh herbs.
8. Place the stuffed sweetbreads on top of the seasoned bacon and veal.
9. Cover the sweetbreads with more slices of veal and bacon.
10. Cover the stewpan and cook the sweetbreads over low heat, both from the top and bottom (a la braise), until they are tender and cooked through.
11. While the sweetbreads are cooking, clean and slit the cockscombs. Stuff them with some of the same forcemeat mixture.
12. In a separate saucepan, melt some bacon fat and add the stuffed cockscombs, small mushrooms, sliced truffles, salt, pepper, and a bundle of fresh herbs. Cook gently until the cockscombs are tender.
13. Remove the cockscombs from the saucepan and drain them.
14. Arrange the cockscombs in a ring on a serving dish.
15. Pour the remaining ragout (cooking liquid from the cockscombs) over the cockscombs.
16. Serve the sweetbreads and cockscombs hot as a first course.
