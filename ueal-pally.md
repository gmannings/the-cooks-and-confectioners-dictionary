## Ingredients:
- 250 grams of fine flour
- 225 grams of butter, cold and cut into small pieces
- 1/2 teaspoon of salt
- 1/2 egg, beaten
- 120 milliliters of cold cream or milk

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to the temperature required for your final pie.
2. In a large mixing bowl, combine the fine flour, cold butter pieces, and salt.
3. Use your fingertips or a pastry cutter to rub the butter into the flour until the mixture resembles breadcrumbs.
4. Make a well in the center of the mixture and add the beaten egg and cold cream or milk.
5. Gradually incorporate the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients, mixing with a fork or your hands until a dough forms. Be careful not to overmix.
6. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead it gently for a minute or two until it comes together smoothly.
7. Divide the dough into two equal portions and shape each portion into a disk.
8. Wrap the dough disks in plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes to allow the gluten to relax and the dough to firm up.
9. After chilling, remove one dough disk from the refrigerator and let it sit at room temperature for a few minutes to soften slightly.
10. Roll out the dough on a lightly floured surface to fit your pie dish or tart pan. Make sure to roll it evenly and to the desired thickness.
11. Carefully transfer the rolled-out dough to your pie dish or tart pan, pressing it gently into the bottom and sides.
12. Trim any excess dough from the edges and crimp or decorate the edges as desired.
13. If using for a pre-baked pie crust, prick the bottom of the crust with a fork to prevent it from puffing up during baking. Alternatively, you can line the crust with parchment paper and fill it with pie weights or dried beans.
14. Bake the crust in the preheated oven according to the instructions for your specific pie recipe or until it is golden brown and cooked through.
15. Remove the crust from the oven and let it cool completely before filling.

## Cooking time
The cooking time will vary depending on the final pie recipe and baking temperature used.
