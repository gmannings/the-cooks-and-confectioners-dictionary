# Farced Calves Tongues

## Description
Farced Calves Tongues is a dish made by stuffing calves tongues with a mixture of minced chicken breast, boiled ham, blanched bacon, mushrooms, chives, parsley, soaked bread crumbs, beef suet, and raw eggs. The stuffed tongues are then braised in a stew-pan until tender. The dish can be served with various sauces or ragouts, such as a hashed sauce, ragout of ham, bacon, veal sweetbreads, endive, or cucumbers.

## Ingredients:
- 4 calves tongues
- 200g minced chicken breast
- 100g boiled ham, finely chopped
- 50g blanched bacon, finely chopped
- 50g mushrooms, finely chopped
- 2 tablespoons chives, finely chopped
- 2 tablespoons parsley, finely chopped
- 50g bread crumbs, soaked in cream
- 50g beef suet, finely chopped
- 2-3 raw eggs, yolks only
- Salt and pepper to taste
- Nutmeg to taste
- 1 ladle of beef gravy

## Instructions:
1. Cut a small hole in the end of each calf's tongue, next to the throat, without breaking the skin.
2. Carefully insert your finger into the hole and run it along the length of the tongue to create a cavity. Be gentle to avoid tearing the skin.
3. In a mortar, pound together the minced chicken breast, boiled ham, blanched bacon, mushrooms, chives, parsley, soaked bread crumbs, beef suet, and egg yolks.
4. Season the mixture with salt, pepper, and nutmeg, and continue pounding until well combined.
5. Stuff each calf's tongue with the prepared mixture, ensuring the cavity is completely filled.
6. Place the stuffed tongues in a stew-pan and add enough water to cover them halfway.
7. Bring the water to a simmer over medium heat, then reduce the heat to low and cover the pan.
8. Allow the tongues to braise for about 1.5-2 hours, or until they are tender. Check occasionally and add more water if needed.
9. Once the tongues are halfway stewed, add a ladle of beef gravy to the pan to enhance the flavor.
10. Continue stewing the tongues until they are fully tender and cooked through.
11. Serve the farced calves tongues with a choice of sauces or ragouts, such as a hashed sauce, ragout of ham, bacon, veal sweetbreads, endive, or cucumbers.
