# Boiling Sugar to its Crack'd Duality

## Description
This recipe is for boiling sugar to its crack'd quality, which is a stage in the sugar boiling process. The crack'd quality refers to the consistency of the sugar syrup when it is cooled. It should form a hard, brittle texture that makes a crackling noise when broken. This is often used as a base for making candies and other sweet treats.

## Ingredients:
- Granulated sugar

## Instructions:
1. In a heavy-bottomed saucepan, add the granulated sugar.
2. Place the saucepan over medium heat and start melting the sugar.
3. Stir the sugar constantly with a wooden spoon until it completely melts and turns into a clear syrup.
4. Continue cooking the syrup, stirring occasionally, until it reaches the desired temperature. For the crack'd quality, the temperature should be around 150-160°C (300-320°F).
5. To test if the sugar has reached the crack'd quality, prepare a bowl of cold water.
6. Dip the tip of your finger into the cold water to wet it.
7. Quickly dip your wet finger into the boiling sugar, making sure to coat it with a thin layer of syrup.
8. Immediately dip your sugar-coated finger back into the cold water.
9. Keep your finger in the water and rub off the sugar with your other two fingers.
10. If the sugar breaks with a crackling noise, it has reached the crack'd quality. If it doesn't break or makes a soft, chewy sound, continue cooking the syrup for a few more minutes and repeat the test.
11. Once the sugar has reached the crack'd quality, remove the saucepan from heat and use the syrup as desired in your recipe.

## Cooking time
Approximately 10-15 minutes, depending on the heat and the desired temperature.
