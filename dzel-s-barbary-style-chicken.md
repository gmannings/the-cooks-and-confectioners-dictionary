# Dzel's Barbary-style Chicken

## Description
This recipe is a modernized version of an 18th-century recipe for Barbary-style chicken. The chicken is trussed, the bones are broken, and the bodies are stuffed with a flavorful filling. The chicken is then boiled in milk, seasoned with herbs, and finally grilled until brown. It is served with a tangy Ramolade sauce.

## Options and commentary
- Instead of boiling the chicken in milk, you can also roast it in the oven for a crispy skin.
- Feel free to adjust the seasoning and herbs according to your taste preferences.
- Ramolade sauce is a tangy mayonnaise-based sauce flavored with herbs and spices. You can make your own or use a store-bought version.

## Ingredients:
- 1 whole chicken
- Salt and pepper
- For the filling:
  - 200g ground meat (pork or chicken)
  - 1 small onion, finely chopped
  - 2 cloves of garlic, minced
  - 1/4 cup breadcrumbs
  - 1/4 cup milk
  - 1 egg
  - Salt and pepper
  - Herbs of your choice (e.g., parsley, thyme, rosemary)
- 1 liter milk (for boiling)
- For the Ramolade sauce:
  - 1/2 cup mayonnaise
  - 1 tablespoon Dijon mustard
  - 1 tablespoon capers, chopped
  - 1 tablespoon gherkins, chopped
  - 1 tablespoon fresh herbs (e.g., parsley, chives), chopped
  - Salt and pepper

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F) if you prefer to roast the chicken instead of boiling it.

2. Truss the chicken by tying the legs together with kitchen twine. This will help the chicken cook evenly.

3. Use a rolling pin or a heavy object to break the bones of the chicken. This will make it easier to stuff and cook.

4. In a bowl, combine the ground meat, chopped onion, minced garlic, breadcrumbs, milk, egg, salt, pepper, and herbs. Mix well until all the ingredients are evenly combined.

5. Stuff the chicken with the filling mixture, making sure to distribute it evenly throughout the body cavity.

6. If boiling the chicken: Place the chicken in a large pot and pour in the milk. Bring the milk to a boil over medium heat, then reduce the heat to low and simmer for about 1 hour or until the chicken is cooked through. Remove the chicken from the pot and set aside.

7. If roasting the chicken: Place the chicken on a roasting rack in a baking dish. Season the chicken with salt, pepper, and herbs. Roast in the preheated oven for about 1 hour or until the chicken is cooked through and the skin is crispy.

8. If boiling the chicken: Preheat a grill or grill pan over medium-high heat. Place the boiled chicken on the grill and cook for a few minutes on each side until browned.

9. If roasting the chicken: Skip this step.

10. While the chicken is grilling, prepare the Ramolade sauce. In a small bowl, combine the mayonnaise, Dijon mustard, chopped capers, chopped gherkins, fresh herbs, salt, and pepper. Mix well until all the ingredients are combined.

11. Remove the chicken from the grill and let it rest for a few minutes. Serve the chicken with the Ramolade sauce on the side.
