# Preserved Walnuts

## Description
Preserved walnuts are a sweet and tangy treat that can be enjoyed on their own or used as a topping for desserts. The walnuts are boiled to remove their bitterness, then cooked in a sugar syrup until they become tender and flavorful. They can be preserved in the syrup or dried in the oven for a longer shelf life.

## Options and commentary
- You can add additional flavors to the syrup, such as lemon peel or amber, to enhance the taste of the preserved walnuts.
- If you prefer a liquid consistency, you can add some apricot syrup to the preserved walnuts.
- Preserved walnuts can be enjoyed on their own, used as a topping for ice cream or yogurt, or incorporated into baked goods.
