# Dzel's Ducks with Celery

## Description
This recipe is a modernized version of an 18th-century dish called "Dzel's Ducks with Celery." The dish consists of braised ducks served with a ragout of celery, veal, and ham. The ducks are tender and flavorful, while the celery ragout adds a savory and aromatic element to the dish.

## Options and commentary
- You can use bone-in or boneless duck breasts for this recipe, depending on your preference.
- If you don't have access to veal, you can substitute it with beef or chicken broth for the ragout.
- Feel free to adjust the amount of vinegar according to your taste preference.

## Ingredients:
- 2 duck breasts
- Salt and pepper, to taste
- 2 cups celery, sliced
- 1 cup veal or beef broth
- 1/4 cup diced ham
- 1 tablespoon butter
- 1 tablespoon all-purpose flour
- 1 tablespoon vinegar

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 350째F (180째C).
2. Season the duck breasts with salt and pepper on both sides.
3. Heat a large oven-safe skillet over medium-high heat. Place the duck breasts skin-side down in the skillet and cook for 5 minutes, or until the skin is golden brown and crispy. Flip the duck breasts and cook for an additional 2 minutes.
4. Transfer the skillet to the preheated oven and roast the duck breasts for 10-12 minutes, or until they reach an internal temperature of 145째F (63째C) for medium-rare. Remove from the oven and let them rest for 5 minutes before slicing.
5. While the duck is roasting, bring a pot of salted water to a boil. Add the sliced celery and cook for about 5 minutes, or until it is slightly tender. Drain the celery and set aside.
6. In a saucepan, combine the veal or beef broth, diced ham, and cooked celery. Cook over medium heat for 5 minutes, or until the mixture is heated through.
7. In a small bowl, mix the butter and flour together to form a paste. Add the paste to the saucepan and stir well to thicken the sauce. Cook for an additional 2 minutes.
8. Stir in the vinegar and cook for another minute.
9. Slice the roasted duck breasts and arrange them on a serving platter. Pour the celery ragout over the duck breasts.
10. Serve the Dzel's Ducks with Celery immediately.
