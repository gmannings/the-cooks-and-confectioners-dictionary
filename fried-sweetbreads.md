# Fried Sweetbreads

## Description
Fried sweetbreads are a delicious and elegant dish made from blanched sweetbreads that are coated in a batter and fried until golden brown. They are then served with fried parsley for added flavor and presentation.

## Ingredients:
- 2 sweetbreads
- Juice of 1 lemon
- Salt
- Pepper
- 4 whole cloves
- 1 bay leaf
- A few sprigs of chives
- 1 onion, sliced
- 1 handful of flour
- 1 egg
- Butter, the size of a walnut
- Hogs lard (or vegetable oil) for frying
- Fresh parsley for garnish

## Instructions:
1. Start by blanching the sweetbreads. Place them in a pot of boiling water and cook for 5 minutes. Remove from the water and let them cool slightly.
2. Once the sweetbreads have cooled, cut each of them into three or four pieces.
3. Prepare a marinade by combining the lemon juice, salt, pepper, cloves, bay leaf, chives, and sliced onion in a bowl. Add the sweetbread pieces to the marinade and let them sit for 2 hours.
4. In the meantime, prepare the batter. In a mixing bowl, combine the flour and a pinch of salt. Gradually add water while whisking until you have a smooth batter. Beat in the egg and melted butter until well combined.
5. Remove the sweetbread pieces from the marinade and pat them dry with a cloth.
6. Dip each sweetbread piece into the batter, making sure it is evenly coated.
7. Heat the hogs lard (or vegetable oil) in a frying pan over medium heat. Carefully place the battered sweetbread pieces into the hot oil and fry until they are golden brown on all sides. This should take about 3-4 minutes per side.
8. Once the sweetbreads are fried, remove them from the pan and drain them on a paper towel-lined plate.
9. In the same pan, fry some parsley until it is crispy.
10. To serve, place a napkin on a serving dish and arrange the fried sweetbreads on top. Garnish with the fried parsley in the center.
11. Serve the fried sweetbreads on plates or small dishes.
