## Description
This recipe is for candying damsons, which are small, tart plums. Candying is a preservation technique that involves coating the fruit in sugar syrup and then drying them. The result is a sweet and chewy treat that can be enjoyed on its own or used in various desserts.

## Ingredients:

- Warm brandy
- Fine sugar

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to a low temperature, around 120Â°C.
2. Take the preserved damsons and remove them from the syrup.
3. Rinse the damsons in warm brandy to wash off the syrup.
4. Place the damsons on a baking tray lined with parchment paper.
5. Sprinkle a generous amount of fine sugar over the damsons, ensuring they are evenly coated.
6. Place the tray in the preheated oven and let the damsons dry for about 10 minutes.
7. Remove the tray from the oven and sprinkle more sugar over the damsons.
8. Repeat steps 6 and 7 two or three more times, until the damsons are completely dry and coated in a thick layer of sugar.
9. Allow the candied damsons to cool completely before storing them in an airtight container.
