# Almond Pudding

## Description
This recipe is for a creamy and fragrant almond pudding. It is made by boiling cream with ginger, then combining it with a mixture of ground almonds, eggs, flour, sugar, and rose water. The pudding is then boiled and served with a buttery sauce flavored with orange and sack (a type of fortified wine).

## Ingredients:
- 1 quart (946 ml) cream
- 1/2 teaspoon ground ginger
- 3/4 pound (340 g) blanched almonds
- 2-3 tablespoons cream
- 11 egg yolks
- 6 egg whites
- 4 tablespoons flour
- 1-2 tablespoons rose water
- 6 ounces (170 g) fine sugar
- Butter, for greasing
- Orange chips, for garnish
- 4 tablespoons butter
- 2 tablespoons sack (fortified wine)
- 2 tablespoons sugar

## Instructions:
1. In a large saucepan, bring the cream and ground ginger to a boil. Reduce the heat and let it simmer for a few minutes. Remove from heat and let it cool.
2. In a food processor or blender, grind the blanched almonds with 2-3 tablespoons of cream until you get a smooth paste.
3. In a mixing bowl, beat the egg yolks and egg whites together until well combined.
4. Add the ground almonds, flour, rose water, and fine sugar to the beaten eggs. Mix well to combine.
5. Once the cream has cooled, pour it into the almond mixture. Stir until everything is well incorporated.
6. Strain the mixture through a fine-mesh strainer to remove any lumps.
7. Grease a double-layered linen cloth with butter. Tie it tightly to form a pudding bag.
8. Place the pudding bag in a large pot of boiling water. Make sure the water level is high enough to cover the pudding bag.
9. Boil the pudding for about an hour, or until it is firm and cooked through.
10. Carefully remove the pudding bag from the pot and let it cool slightly.
11. Unwrap the pudding and transfer it to a serving dish.
12. Decorate the pudding with orange chips.
13. In a small saucepan, melt the butter over low heat. Add the sack and sugar, and stir until the sugar has dissolved.
14. Pour the buttery sauce over the pudding.
15. Serve the almond pudding warm with the butter sauce.
