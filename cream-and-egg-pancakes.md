# Cream and Egg Pancakes

## Description
Cream and Egg Pancakes are a delicious and fluffy breakfast dish made with a batter of cream, eggs, flour, and spices. These pancakes are a great alternative to traditional pancakes made with butter or lard.

## Options and commentary
- You can use heavy cream or whipping cream for this recipe.
- Feel free to adjust the amount of sugar according to your taste preference.
- You can add additional spices like cinnamon or vanilla extract for extra flavor.

## Ingredients:
- 1 quart (950 ml) cream
- 12 eggs
- 2 nutmegs, grated
- 1 teaspoon beaten mace
- 1/2 pound (225 g) sugar
- Flour, as needed

## Instructions:
1. In a large mixing bowl, combine the cream and eggs. Beat them well together until fully incorporated.
2. Add the grated nutmegs, beaten mace, and sugar to the cream and egg mixture. Stir well to combine.
3. Gradually add flour to the mixture, stirring continuously, until the batter reaches a consistency that is neither too thick nor too thin. The amount of flour needed may vary, but aim for a smooth and pourable batter.
4. Heat a frying pan over medium heat. Once the pan is hot, wipe it clean with a paper towel to remove any residue.
5. Pour a ladleful of the batter onto the hot frying pan, spreading it out gently with the back of the ladle to form a round pancake shape.
6. Cook the pancake for a few minutes on one side until golden brown, then flip it over using a spatula and cook the other side until golden brown as well.
7. Remove the pancake from the pan and place it on a plate. Repeat the process with the remaining batter, adding more oil or butter to the pan as needed.
8. Serve the cream and egg pancakes warm with your favorite toppings such as maple syrup, fresh fruits, or whipped cream.
