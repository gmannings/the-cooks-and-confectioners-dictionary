# Bufoles

## Description
Bufoles is a dish made with layers of beef steaks, bacon, onions, parsley, and spices, cooked in a stew-pan. It is then served with a sauce made from partridge carcasses.

## Ingredients:
- 500g beef steaks (such as sirloin or ribeye)
- 200g bacon, thinly sliced
- 2 onions, thinly sliced
- 1 bunch of parsley, chopped
- Spices (such as salt, pepper, and any other preferred spices)
- Carcasses of 2 partridges

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 180Â°C.
2. Take the beef steaks and pound them lightly with the back of a knife to tenderize them.
3. In a stew-pan, arrange a layer of thinly sliced bacon at the bottom.
4. Sprinkle a layer of chopped onions, parsley, and spices over the bacon.
5. Place another layer of beef steaks on top of the onions and spices.
6. Repeat steps 3-5 until all the ingredients are used, finishing with a layer of bacon on top.
7. Cover the stew-pan tightly with a lid.
8. Place the stew-pan in the preheated oven and cook for about 2 hours, or until the beef is tender.
9. While the bufoles are cooking, prepare the cullis sauce. In a separate saucepan, simmer the partridge carcasses in water for about 1 hour to extract the flavors.
10. Remove the carcasses from the saucepan and discard any excess fat.
11. Strain the liquid from the carcasses to remove any solids.
12. Pour the cullis sauce over the cooked bufoles when they are ready to be served.

## Cooking time
Approximately 2 hours for cooking the bufoles.
