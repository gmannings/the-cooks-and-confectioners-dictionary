# Cracknels

## Description
Cracknels are a type of crispy biscuit or cracker that originated in the 18th century. They are made with a simple dough that is flavored with rosewater and nutmeg, and then baked until golden and crispy.

## Ingredients:
- 3 liters of flour
- 454 grams of butter
- 8 egg yolks
- 8 tablespoons of rosewater
- 1 grated nutmeg
- Cold water

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F).

2. In a large mixing bowl, combine the flour, grated nutmeg, and a pinch of salt.

3. In a separate bowl, beat the egg yolks with the rosewater until well combined.

4. Add the egg yolk mixture to the flour mixture and mix until it resembles coarse crumbs.

5. Gradually add cold water, a little at a time, and mix until the dough comes together and forms a stiff paste.

6. On a lightly floured surface, roll out the dough to a thickness of about 1/4 inch.

7. Cut the dough into desired shapes, such as rectangles or circles.

8. Place the cut dough onto baking sheets lined with parchment paper.

9. Bake in the preheated oven for about 15-20 minutes, or until the cracknels are golden brown and crispy.

10. Remove from the oven and let them cool completely on a wire rack.
