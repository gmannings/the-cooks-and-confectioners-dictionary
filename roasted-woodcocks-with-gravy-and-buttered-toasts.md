# Roasted Woodcocks with Gravy and Buttered Toasts

## Description
This recipe is for roasted woodcocks, a small game bird. The woodcocks are roasted and basted with butter, then coated with grated bread. The gravy is preserved and served with buttered toasts. Alternatively, you can roast the woodcock guts, mince them, and add them to the gravy along with a little claret.

## Ingredients:
- 2 woodcocks
- Butter, for basting
- Grated bread
- Salt and pepper, to taste
- 4 slices of bread
- Claret (optional)

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F).
2. Draw the woodcocks by removing the innards and feathers. Wash them thoroughly.
3. Truss the woodcocks by tying the legs and wings close to the body.
4. Spit the woodcocks on a roasting spit or place them on a roasting rack in a roasting pan.
5. Roast the woodcocks in the preheated oven for about 15-20 minutes, or until they are almost cooked through.
6. Baste the woodcocks with butter every 5 minutes during the roasting process.
7. When the woodcocks are almost roasted, remove them from the oven and sprinkle them with grated bread, coating them evenly.
8. Return the woodcocks to the oven and continue roasting for another 5 minutes, or until the bread coating is golden brown and crispy.
9. While the woodcocks are roasting, prepare the gravy. Pour any drippings from the roasting pan into a saucepan and heat over medium heat.
10. If desired, roast the woodcock guts alongside the woodcocks. Once roasted, mince the guts and set aside.
11. Add the minced guts (if using) to the saucepan with the drippings. Stir in a little claret, if desired, and cook for a few minutes to combine the flavors.
12. In the meantime, toast the slices of bread until golden brown.
13. Butter the toasted bread slices.
14. Serve the roasted woodcocks with the gravy and buttered toasts on the side.
