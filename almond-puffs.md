# Almond Puffs

## Description
Almond Puffs are delicate, sweet pastries made with ground almonds and flavored with orange flower water. They have a light and airy texture and are perfect for a sweet treat or afternoon tea.

## Ingredients:
- 60g blanched almonds
- 250ml orange flower water
- 3 egg whites
- 100g sifted sugar

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F).
2. In a food processor, grind the blanched almonds until they are very fine.
3. In a mixing bowl, combine the ground almonds, orange flower water, and sifted sugar. Mix well until the sugar is dissolved.
4. In a separate bowl, whip the egg whites until they form stiff peaks.
5. Gently fold the whipped egg whites into the almond mixture until well combined.
6. Gradually add more sifted sugar to the mixture until it forms a paste-like consistency.
7. Using a spoon or piping bag, shape the almond mixture into small cakes on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper.
8. Bake the almond puffs in the preheated oven for about 15-20 minutes, or until they are lightly golden brown.
