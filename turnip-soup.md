# Turnip Soup

## Description
This recipe is for a hearty turnip soup, made with diced turnips that are fried and then boiled in a flavorful gravy. The soup can be served with a roasted duck in the middle for added richness. The dish is garnished with diced turnips boiled in white broth and fried turnip pieces shaped like cock's combs. The bread is soaked in fat and gravy for extra flavor.

## Options and commentary
- Instead of frying the turnips in hogs lard or clarified butter, you can use vegetable oil or olive oil.
- If you don't have a roasted duck, you can omit it or substitute it with roasted chicken or turkey.
- The garnish of diced turnips boiled in white broth and fried turnip pieces shaped like cock's combs is optional. You can garnish the soup with fresh herbs or croutons instead.
- For soaking the bread, you can use the fat and gravy from the soup or use butter or olive oil.
