# Frically Partridges

## Description
Frically Partridges is a dish made with roasted partridges that are then fried with onions and served with a flavorful sauce made from gravy, anchovies, eggs, white wine, grated bread, and drawn butter. The dish has a rich and savory flavor.

## Ingredients:
- 2 partridges
- 1 onion, chopped
- 1/2 pint (240 ml) gravy
- 2-3 anchovies, finely chopped
- 2 egg yolks
- 1/4 cup (60 ml) white wine
- 1/4 cup (30 g) grated bread
- 2 tablespoons (30 g) drawn butter

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F).
2. Place the partridges on a roasting rack and roast them in the preheated oven until they are three-quarters cooked, about 30-40 minutes.
3. Remove the partridges from the oven and let them cool slightly. Carve the partridges into serving pieces.
4. In a large frying pan, heat some oil or butter over medium heat. Add the chopped onion and sauté until it becomes translucent and lightly browned.
5. Add the carved partridge pieces to the frying pan with the onions and cook for a few minutes until they are heated through.
6. In a separate saucepan, combine the gravy, chopped anchovies, beaten egg yolks, white wine, grated bread, and drawn butter. Stir well to combine.
7. Place the saucepan over medium heat and cook the sauce, stirring constantly, until it thickens to a desired consistency.
8. Pour the thickened sauce over the fried partridge pieces in the frying pan. Stir gently to coat the partridges evenly with the sauce.
9. Cook the partridges in the sauce for a few more minutes until they are fully heated and the flavors have melded together.
10. Transfer the frically partridges to a serving dish and garnish with fresh herbs, if desired.
11. Serve the frically partridges hot.
