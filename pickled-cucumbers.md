# Pickled Cucumbers

## Description
This recipe is for pickling small cucumbers. The cucumbers are soaked in a brine, then layered with dill, long pepper, and mace in a jar. Hot vinegar is poured over the cucumbers and the jar is sealed. The vinegar is then boiled and poured over the cucumbers multiple times, with a piece of alum added. The pickled cucumbers are then ready to be stored.
