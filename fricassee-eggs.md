# Fricassee Eggs

## Description
Fricassee Eggs is a dish made with hard-boiled eggs, white Port wine, gravy, oysters, mushrooms, and spinach. It is a rich and flavorful dish that can be served as a main course or as a side dish.

## Options and commentary
- Instead of white Port wine, you can use a dry white wine or chicken broth as a substitute.
- If you don't have access to fresh oysters, you can use canned oysters or omit them altogether.
- You can use button mushrooms or any other type of mushrooms you prefer.
- For the garnish, you can use lemon slices and crispy bread croutons.

## Ingredients:
- 12 eggs
- 180 ml white Port wine (or substitute)
- 360 ml good quality gravy
- Salt and pepper to taste
- 2 blades of mace
- 100 g oysters
- 100 g mushrooms
- 30 g butter
- 1 egg yolk
- 1 tablespoon flour
- 200 g spinach
- 200 g large oysters (optional)
- Lemon slices, for garnish
- Crispy bread croutons, for garnish

## Instructions:
1. Boil the eggs until they are hard-boiled. Once cooked, remove the shells and cut the eggs into quarters.
2. In a stewpan, combine the quartered eggs, white Port wine, gravy, salt, pepper, and blades of mace.
3. Add the oysters and mushrooms to the stewpan.
4. In a separate bowl, mix the butter, egg yolk, and flour together until well combined. This will be used to thicken the sauce.
5. Pour the butter mixture into the stewpan and stir well to combine.
6. Place the stewpan on the stove over medium heat and cook until the sauce thickens and the ingredients are heated through.
7. While the fricassee is cooking, prepare the spinach by blanching it in boiling water for a few minutes until wilted. Drain and set aside.
8. If using large oysters, cook them separately by boiling them in water until they are cooked through. Drain and set aside.
9. To serve, arrange the fricassee eggs on a serving dish. Surround the dish with the cooked large oysters and garnish with lemon slices and crispy bread croutons.
