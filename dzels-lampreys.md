# Dzels Lampreys

## Description
Dzels Lampreys is a dish made with lampreys, a type of eel-like fish. The lampreys are cleaned, seasoned, and stewed in a flavorful mixture of white wine, browned butter, herbs, and spices. The dish is finished with the addition of the lamprey's blood, fried flour, capers, and slices of lemon.

## Ingredients:
- 4 lampreys
- Salt
- Pepper
- Nutmeg
- 1 cup white wine
- 2 tablespoons butter
- A bunch of sweet herbs (such as parsley, thyme, and rosemary)
- 1 bay leaf
- 2 tablespoons flour
- 2 tablespoons capers
- Slices of lemon for garnish

## Instructions:
1. Begin by bleeding the lampreys. To do this, make a small incision near the head of each lamprey and collect the blood in a bowl. Set the blood aside for later use.
2. Clean the lampreys by rinsing them in warm water. Remove any excess slime or impurities.
3. Cut the lampreys into pieces, about 2-3 inches in length.
4. Season the lamprey pieces with salt, pepper, and nutmeg. Make sure to coat all sides of the pieces evenly.
5. In an earthen pan or a heavy-bottomed pot, melt the butter over medium heat until it turns brown. This will add a rich, nutty flavor to the dish.
6. Add the lamprey pieces to the pot and cook them for a few minutes on each side until they are lightly browned.
7. Pour in the white wine, along with the sweet herbs and bay leaf. The wine will help tenderize the lampreys and infuse them with flavor.
8. Reduce the heat to low and cover the pot. Let the lampreys simmer gently for about 30 minutes, or until they are cooked through and tender.
9. In a separate bowl, mix the lamprey blood with the flour until well combined. This will help thicken the sauce.
10. Remove the lamprey pieces from the pot and set them aside.
11. Increase the heat to medium and add the blood-flour mixture to the pot, stirring constantly. This will create a thick, rich sauce.
12. Add the capers to the pot and continue cooking for a few more minutes until the sauce has thickened and the flavors have melded together.
13. Return the lamprey pieces to the pot and gently stir to coat them with the sauce.
14. Garnish the dish with slices of lemon.
15. Serve the Dzels Lampreys hot, accompanied by crusty bread or steamed vegetables.
