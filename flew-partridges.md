# Flew Partridges

## Description
This recipe involves parboiling partridges and then cutting them into small pieces. The meat is then stewed with the bones, seasoned with salt and pepper, and finished with a squeeze of lemon juice. The dish is served hot.

## Ingredients:
- 6 partridges
- Salt
- Pepper
- Sweet oil (such as olive oil)
- Juice of 1 lemon

## Instructions:
1. Parboil the partridges by placing them in a pot of boiling water for a few minutes. This will partially cook the birds and make it easier to cut them into pieces.
2. Remove the partridges from the pot and let them cool slightly.
3. Cut the partridges into small pieces, separating the joint bones.
4. Cut the meat into large slices, but do not completely detach it from the bones.
5. Place the meat and bones (except the breast bones) into a pot or pipkin.
6. Add some of the liquid from the parboiling process to the pot.
7. Season the meat and bones with salt and pepper.
8. Place the pot on the stove and stew the meat and bones over low heat.
9. After a while, add a little sweet oil to the pot.
10. Continue stewing until the meat is cooked through and tender.
11. Squeeze the juice of a lemon into the pot and stir well.
12. Pour the stewed partridges into a large dish.
13. Serve the dish hot.
