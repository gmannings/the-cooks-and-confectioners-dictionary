# White Hippocrals

## Description
White Hippocrals is a sweet and spiced wine-based drink that was popular in the 18th century. It is made with white wine, cinnamon, sugar, lemon, and spices. This beverage can be enjoyed chilled or served warm.

## Ingredients:
- 1 gallon (3.8 liters) of white wine (white Lisbon wine or any dry white wine)
- 2 ounces (56 grams) of cinnamon sticks
- 2 pounds (907 grams) of sugar
- 1/2 teaspoon of ground mace
- A few whole black peppercorns
- 2 lemons, cut into four pieces
- Optional: a grain of musk and amber, beaten with sugar and wrapped in cotton

## Instructions:
1. In a large container, combine the white wine, cinnamon sticks, sugar, ground mace, and whole black peppercorns.
2. Add the lemon pieces to the mixture.
3. Allow the ingredients to infuse in the wine for some time, preferably overnight or for at least 4-6 hours.
4. After the infusion period, strain the mixture using a straining bag or a fine-mesh sieve to remove the solid ingredients.
5. If desired, wrap a grain of musk and amber, beaten with sugar, in cotton and attach it to the end of the straining bag to give the drink a fragrant aroma.
6. Hang the straining bag over a vessel or container, ensuring that it is securely placed underneath to collect the strained liquid.
7. Allow the liquid to drip from the straining bag for several hours or overnight until you have collected all the strained liquor.
8. Once all the liquid has been collected, transfer it to a clean container or bottles for storage.
9. Serve the White Hippocrals chilled or warm, depending on your preference.

## Options and commentary:
- You can use any dry white wine of your choice if white Lisbon wine is not available.
- Adjust the amount of sugar according to your taste preference. You can reduce or increase the amount as desired.
- The addition of musk and amber is optional and may not be easily accessible. If you choose to use it, make sure to wrap it securely in cotton to prevent it from mixing with the drink.
- Feel free to experiment with other spices such as cloves or nutmeg to add more complexity to the flavor.
