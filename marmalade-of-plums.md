# Marmalade of Plums

## Description
This recipe is for making a delicious plum marmalade. The plums are either pitted or scalded to remove the stones, then cooked down and sweetened with sugar. The marmalade is then simmered and preserved in jars.

## Ingredients:
- Plums
- Sugar

## Instructions:
1. If the plums are easy to pit, remove the stones. If not, scald the plums in boiling water until they become very soft.
2. Drain the plums well and squeeze them through a sieve to remove any skins or large pieces.
3. Transfer the plum puree to a saucepan and place it over low heat.
4. Add an equal weight of cracked sugar to the plum puree. For example, if you have 500 grams of plum puree, add 500 grams of sugar.
5. Stir the mixture continuously over low heat until the sugar has dissolved completely.
6. Increase the heat to medium and bring the mixture to a simmer. Cook for about 20-30 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the marmalade thickens and reaches the desired consistency.
7. While the marmalade is still hot, carefully pour it into clean glass jars or pots.
8. Sprinkle the top of each jar with a layer of sugar to help preserve the marmalade.
9. Seal the jars tightly and allow them to cool completely before storing them in a cool, dark place.

## Cooking time
Approximately 20-30 minutes.
