# Barley Soup with Veal

## Description
This recipe is for a hearty and comforting barley soup with tender pieces of veal. The barley is boiled in two waters to remove any impurities and then cooked with a knuckle of veal to create a flavorful broth. The soup is seasoned with salt, raisins, sweet herbs, whole mace, and slices of white bread.

## Ingredients:
- 200g barley
- 500g veal knuckle
- Salt, to taste
- 50g raisins
- 1 faggot of sweet herbs (such as thyme, parsley, and bay leaves)
- 1 whole mace
- 4 slices of white bread

## Instructions:
1. In a large pot, bring water to a boil and add the barley. Boil the barley for 5 minutes, then drain and rinse with cold water. Repeat this process one more time to remove any impurities from the barley.
2. Place the veal knuckle in the pot with the barley and add enough water to cover the ingredients. Bring to a boil and then reduce the heat to a simmer. Cook for about 1 hour, or until the veal is tender.
3. Remove the veal knuckle from the pot and set it aside to cool slightly. Once cool enough to handle, remove the meat from the bone and shred it into small pieces. Discard any excess fat or gristle.
4. Return the shredded veal to the pot with the barley and broth. Add salt to taste, along with the raisins, faggot of sweet herbs, and whole mace. Stir well to combine.
5. Simmer the soup for an additional 30 minutes to allow the flavors to meld together.
6. While the soup is simmering, toast the slices of white bread until golden brown. Cut the toasted bread into small cubes.
7. Serve the barley soup hot, garnished with the toasted bread cubes.
