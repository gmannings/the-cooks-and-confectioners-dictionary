# Sultanes

## Description
Sultanes are a type of sweet pastry made with a mixture of eggs, sugar, flour, and a hint of musk. They are baked until golden and then rolled up into wafer-like shapes. Sultanes can be served upright in plates or china dishes.

## Ingredients:
- 8 eggs (yolks and whites)
- Powdered sugar (equal weight to the eggs)
- Fine flour (half the weight of the eggs)
- A pinch of musk (powdered) mixed with a little sugar

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to the recommended temperature for baking pastries.

2. In a mixing bowl, combine the yolks and whites of the eggs.

3. Add powdered sugar to the eggs, using the same weight as the combined weight of the eggs.

4. Mix the sugar and eggs until well combined.

5. Add fine flour to the mixture, using half the weight of the eggs.

6. Grind a grain of musk into a fine powder and mix it with a little sugar.

7. Add the musk-sugar mixture to the bowl and mix well.

8. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.

9. Using a spoon, drop small portions of the mixture onto the parchment paper, forming small rounds or shapes. Leave enough space between each portion for them to spread slightly during baking.

10. Sprinkle a little sugar on top of each portion.

11. Place the baking sheet with the sultanes in a portable oven with heat sources at the top and bottom.

12. Bake the sultanes until they turn a good golden color. This may take approximately 15-20 minutes, but keep an eye on them as baking times may vary.

13. Once baked, remove the sultanes from the oven and carefully peel off the parchment paper.

14. While still warm, roll each sultane into a wafer-like shape.

15. Arrange the rolled sultanes upright in plates or china dishes for serving.

## Cooking time
Approximately 15-20 minutes, depending on the oven.
