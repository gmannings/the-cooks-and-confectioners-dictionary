# Milk Chocolate

## Description
This recipe is for making milk chocolate from scratch. It involves combining milk, unsweetened chocolate, sugar, flour or starch, and a little salt. The mixture is then dissolved and boiled to create a smooth and creamy milk chocolate.

## Ingredients:
- 1 liter of milk
- 115 grams of unsweetened chocolate
- 115 grams of fine sugar
- 7 grams of fine flour or starch
- A pinch of salt

## Instructions:
1. In a saucepan, heat the milk over medium heat until it is hot but not boiling.
2. While the milk is heating, finely chop the unsweetened chocolate.
3. Once the milk is hot, add the chopped chocolate to the saucepan and stir until it is completely melted and well combined with the milk.
4. In a separate bowl, mix together the fine sugar, fine flour or starch, and a pinch of salt.
5. Gradually add the sugar mixture to the saucepan, stirring constantly to prevent lumps from forming.
6. Continue to cook the mixture over medium heat, stirring constantly, until it thickens and reaches a smooth and creamy consistency. This may take about 10-15 minutes.
7. Once the milk chocolate has thickened, remove it from the heat and let it cool slightly.
8. Pour the milk chocolate into molds or a shallow dish lined with parchment paper.
9. Allow the milk chocolate to cool completely at room temperature, then transfer it to the refrigerator to chill and set for at least 2 hours.
10. Once the milk chocolate is firm, remove it from the molds or dish and cut it into desired shapes or break it into pieces.

## Cooking time
Approximately 10-15 minutes for cooking, plus 2 hours for chilling and setting.
