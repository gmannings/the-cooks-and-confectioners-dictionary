# Soop au Bourgeois

## Description
Soop au Bourgeois is a traditional 18th century soup made with broth, gravy, endive, celery, and bread. It can be served with a chicken in the middle for added flavor and garnished with a rim and celery pieces.

## Options and commentary
- You can choose to make the soup either brown or clear. To make it brown, blanch the herbs in boiling water before adding them to the gravy. To make it clear, skip the blanching step.
- You can add a pullet or chicken in the middle of the soup for added flavor and texture.
- Garnish the soup with a rim and celery pieces on the outside for presentation.

## Ingredients:
- Good broth
- Gravy
- Heads of endive
- 3 bunches of celery
- French roll crusts
- Pullet or chicken (optional)

## Instructions:
1. Wash the heads of endive and three bunches of celery. Peel off the outer layer of the celery and cut them into pieces about an inch in length. Swing them dry in a napkin.
2. If you want the soup to be brown, blanch the herbs in boiling water for five or six minutes. If you want it clear, skip this step.
3. Put the blanched or unblanched herbs into a quart of boiling gravy.
4. Put the French roll crusts into a pint and a half of gravy. Boil it and strain it through a sieve.
5. When the herbs are almost ready, add the strained gravy to them.
6. If desired, place a pullet or chicken in the middle of the soup.
7. Garnish the soup with a rim and celery pieces on the outside.
8. Soak bread in good broth or gravy.
