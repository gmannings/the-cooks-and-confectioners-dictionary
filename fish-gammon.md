- If carp skins are not available, you can use any other fish skin or even substitute with bacon.
- The boiling liquid can be made with a mixture of half wine and half water, seasoned with pepper, cloves, and a bay leaf.
- The dish can be served cold or at room temperature.

## Ingredients:
- Fresh salmon
- Tenches
- Eels
- Carp roes
- Butter
- Salt
- Pepper
- Nutmeg
- Carp skins (or substitute with fish skin or bacon)

## Instructions:
1. Mince the flesh of fresh salmon, tenches, eels, and carp roes.
2. Pound the minced fish flesh in a mortar with butter, salt, pepper, and nutmeg until well combined.
3. Lay out the carp skins (or substitute) and spread the minced fish mixture on top, shaping it into a gammon-like form.
4. Wrap the fish mixture tightly in a clean linen cloth and tie it securely.
5. In a large pot, bring a mixture of half wine and half water to a boil. Season the liquid with pepper, cloves, and a bay leaf.
6. Carefully place the wrapped fish gammon into the boiling liquid and let it simmer for a certain amount of time (exact cooking time will depend on the size of the gammon).
