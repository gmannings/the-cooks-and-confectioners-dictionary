# Dried Apricots

## Description
This recipe is for making dried apricots. The apricots are first peeled, sliced, and blanched in a sugar syrup. Then they are soaked in the syrup for a few days to absorb the flavors. Finally, they are dried in a low-temperature oven or dehydrator until they are completely dry.

## Ingredients:
- 1 kg ripe apricots
- 500 g sugar
- Water

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 50째C (120째F) or the lowest temperature setting if your oven doesn't go that low. Alternatively, you can use a food dehydrator set to a low temperature.
2. Wash the apricots and remove the skins by gently peeling them off.
3. Cut the apricots into thin slices and remove the pits.
4. In a saucepan, combine the sugar with enough water to make a syrup. Use half the weight of the apricots in sugar. For example, if you have 1 kg of apricots, use 500 g of sugar.
5. Heat the syrup over medium heat until it reaches the candy stage. This is when the syrup reaches a temperature of around 120째C (250째F) and forms a soft ball when dropped into cold water.
6. Add the sliced apricots to the syrup and cook them until they become tender. This should take about 10-15 minutes.
7. Remove the saucepan from the heat and let the apricots cool in the syrup.
8. Once cooled, transfer the apricots and syrup to a container and let them sit for 2-3 days, stirring gently once a day to ensure all the apricots are evenly soaked in the syrup.
9. After the soaking period, remove the apricots from the syrup and place them on a wire rack or baking sheet lined with parchment paper.
10. Place the apricots in the preheated oven or dehydrator and dry them for several hours, or until they are completely dry and leathery. This can take anywhere from 6 to 12 hours, depending on the thickness of the slices and the moisture content of the apricots.
11. Once the apricots are dry, remove them from the oven or dehydrator and let them cool completely.
12. Store the dried apricots in an airtight container in a cool, dry place.

## Cooking time
Approximately 6-12 hours, depending on the thickness of the slices and the moisture content of the apricots.
