# Quince Marmalade

## Description
This recipe is for making quince marmalade, a sweet and tangy spread made from quinces. The marmalade has a jelly-like consistency and can be enjoyed on toast, scones, or used as a filling for pastries.

## Options and commentary
- You can choose to strain the marmalade through a straining bag or a linen cloth to remove any solids, but avoid squeezing the quinces to prevent cloudiness in the marmalade.
- Adding a little claret (red wine) to the marmalade gives it a deeper flavor, but it is optional.
- Spices such as cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves, and mace can be added to enhance the flavor of the marmalade.

## Ingredients:
- Quinces (unpeeled), cut into quarters
- Water
- Sugar (equal weight to the quinces)
- Optional: Claret (red wine)
- Optional: Cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves, and mace

## Instructions:
1. Place the quince quarters in a large pot and cover them with water.
2. Boil the quinces until they dissolve and turn into a marmalade-like consistency. This may take around 1-2 hours.
3. Once the quinces have dissolved, strain the mixture through a straining bag or linen cloth. Do not squeeze the quinces, just let the liquid strain naturally. Set the quince liquor aside.
4. In a separate pot, add the sugar and heat it over medium heat until it becomes caramelized or "crack'd." This may take around 10-15 minutes.
5. Carefully pour the caramelized sugar into the quince liquor. If desired, add a little claret (red wine) to the mixture.
6. Optional: Add spices such as cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves, and mace to the pot.
7. Boil the mixture together, skimming off any impurities that rise to the surface. Stir the mixture occasionally.
8. Continue boiling until the marmalade reaches the consistency of a fine jelly. You can test this by spooning a small amount onto a plate. If it falls in large drops or returns to its pearled quality, it is ready.
9. Remove the pot from the heat and strain the marmalade through a linen cloth or sieve to remove any remaining solids.
10. Transfer the marmalade into pots or glasses for storage.
11. Alternatively, you can pour the marmalade into leaden molds. Once cooled, place the molds in hot water (bain-marie) to loosen the marmalade pieces. The marmalade will easily fall out and can be stored in boxes.

## Cooking time
Approximately 1-2 hours for boiling the quinces, 10-15 minutes for caramelizing the sugar, and additional time for boiling the marmalade to the desired consistency.
