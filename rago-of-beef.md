# Rago of Beef

## Description
This recipe is for a slow-cooked beef dish, known as a rago. The beef is larded with bacon and cooked in a stew-pan with additional bacon slices. It is seasoned with salt, pepper, nutmeg, cloves, and herbs, and then covered with bacon strips. The dish is cooked slowly for twelve hours, and then a little brandy is added for flavor. It is garnished with pickles and served.

## Options and commentary
- Instead of larding the beef with bacon, you can use a marbled cut of beef, such as chuck roast, which will provide enough fat for flavor and tenderness.
- You can adjust the seasoning to your taste, adding more or less salt, pepper, nutmeg, cloves, and herbs.
- The brandy can be omitted if desired, or you can substitute it with red wine or beef broth for added flavor.

## Ingredients:
- 1.5 kg beef (such as chuck roast), cut into large chunks
- 200 g bacon, cut into thick lardons
- Salt, to taste
- Pepper, to taste
- 2 nutmegs, grated
- 6 cloves, ground
- Fresh herbs (such as thyme, rosemary, and parsley), tied together with kitchen twine
- 200 g bacon slices
- 500 g lard
- 50 ml brandy
- Pickles, for garnish

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 150Â°C.
2. Using a sharp knife, make small incisions in the beef and insert the bacon lardons into the meat.
3. Place the beef chunks in a large stew-pan and arrange the bacon slices at the bottom.
4. Season the beef with salt, pepper, grated nutmeg, ground cloves, and add the tied herbs.
5. Cover the beef with the bacon slices, ensuring it is completely covered.
6. Add the lard to the stew-pan, making sure the beef is submerged.
7. Cover the stew-pan with a lid and place it in the preheated oven.
8. Cook the beef for 12 hours, checking occasionally to ensure it is cooking gently and not boiling.
9. After 12 hours, remove the stew-pan from the oven and carefully pour in the brandy.
10. Return the stew-pan to the oven and cook for an additional 30 minutes.
11. Remove the beef from the stew-pan and let it rest for a few minutes before slicing.
