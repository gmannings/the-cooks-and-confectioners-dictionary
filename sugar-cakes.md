# Sugar Cakes

## Description
Sugar Cakes are sweet, buttery cakes that were popular in the 18th century. They are made with a combination of sugar, flour, butter, eggs, cream, and aromatic spices like cinnamon and nutmeg. The dough is rolled out into thin cakes and baked until golden and crisp.

## Ingredients:
- 450g fine sugar
- 225g fine flour
- 450g unsalted butter, softened
- 8 egg yolks
- 1 tsp rose water
- 1 tsp ground cinnamon
- 1 tsp ground nutmeg
- 120ml cream

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F).
2. In a large bowl, combine the fine sugar and fine flour. Sift the mixture to remove any lumps.
3. Add the softened butter to the sugar and flour mixture. Use your hands or a pastry cutter to work the butter into the dry ingredients until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs.
4. In a separate bowl, beat the egg yolks with the rose water until well combined.
5. Add the cinnamon and nutmeg to the egg yolk mixture and stir to combine.
6. Pour the egg yolk mixture into the bowl with the butter and dry ingredients. Mix well until a stiff dough forms.
7. Gradually add the cream to the dough, kneading it in until the dough becomes smooth and pliable.
8. On a lightly floured surface, roll out the dough to a thickness of about 1/4 inch.
9. Use a cookie cutter or a glass to cut out round shapes from the rolled dough. Prick the surface of each cake with a fork to prevent them from puffing up during baking.
10. Place the cakes on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper or a silicone baking mat.
11. Bake in the preheated oven for about 12-15 minutes, or until the edges of the cakes are golden brown.
12. Remove from the oven and let the cakes cool on a wire rack before serving.
