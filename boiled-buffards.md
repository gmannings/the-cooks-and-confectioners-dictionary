# Boiled Buffards

## Description
Boiled Buffards is a dish made with minced pork and beef, flavored with herbs and spices, and stuffed into the skins of the buffards (a type of bird).

## Instructions:
1. In a large bowl, combine the minced pork, minced beef, beef suet, salt, pepper, nutmeg, and chopped herbs. Mix well.
2. Add the egg yolks, boiled artichoke bottoms, roasted chestnuts, diced marrow, and diced skirrets to the meat mixture. Mix until well combined.
3. Stuff the mixture into the skins of the buffards, making sure to prick them on the back to prevent bursting during cooking.
4. Place the stuffed buffards into a deep dish.
5. Pour the strong broth and white wine over the stuffed buffards in the dish.
6. Sprinkle the large mace over the dish.
7. Add the quartered boiled artichokes, salt, barberries (if using), grapes, pears, and meatballs to the dish.
8. Cover the dish with a lid or foil.
9. Place the dish on the stove and bring the broth to a simmer.
10. Reduce the heat to low and let the buffards stew for about 1-2 hours, or until they are cooked through and tender.
11. While the buffards are cooking, prepare the sippets by toasting small pieces of bread until crisp.
12. Once the buffards are cooked, remove them from the dish and place them on a serving platter.
13. Strain the cooking liquid and pour it over the buffards.
14. Garnish the dish with lemon slices, lemon peel, chestnuts, large mace, and egg yolks.
15. Melt some butter and brush it over the buffards to give them a glossy finish.
16. Serve the boiled buffards on the sippets, with the garnishes arranged around them.
