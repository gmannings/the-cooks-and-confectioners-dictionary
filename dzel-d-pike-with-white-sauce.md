# Dzel'd Pike with White Sauce

## Description
This recipe is for preparing a pike fish in a white sauce. The pike is first gutted, scaled, and cleaned, then boiled in a mixture of wine and water with herbs. The white sauce is made by melting butter with flour, seasoning it with salt, pepper, nutmeg, lemon slices, chives, anchovies, water, and vinegar. The sauce is then thickened over a stove and poured over the cooked pike before serving.

## Ingredients:
- 1 pike fish
