# Alamode Beef

## Description
Alamode Beef is a dish made with a piece of beef that is larded with fat bacon and seasoned with spices. It is then stewed in a flavorful broth until tender. The dish can be served hot or cold.

## Ingredients:
- Piece of beef (such as chuck roast or brisket)
- Fat bacon
- Salt
- Pepper
- Nutmeg
- Cloves
- Mace
- Sweet herbs (such as thyme, rosemary, or parsley)
- Shalots (shallots)
- Bay leaf
- Beef broth
- Claret (red wine)
- Anchovies

## Instructions:
1. Remove the fat skin from the piece of beef and pound it with a meat mallet or rolling pin to flatten it.
2. Lard the beef by inserting lardons of fat bacon into the meat, making sure they are as thick as your finger and as long as the meat is thick.
3. Season the beef with salt, pepper, nutmeg, cloves, and mace, rubbing the spices into the meat.
4. In a large pot, boil another piece of beef to make a strong broth. Add a handful of sweet herbs, shalots, and bay leaf to the broth.
5. Remove the boiled beef from the pot and add the larded beef to the broth. Stew the beef in the broth until it is tender and the broth has a well-developed flavor.
6. If there is excess broth, remove some of it from the pot. Add claret and anchovies to the pot and continue stewing until the liquid thickens and has a strong, spiced flavor.
7. Remove the beef from the pot and discard the bay leaf and shalots.
8. Serve the Alamode Beef hot or cold.

## Cooking time
The cooking time will vary depending on the size and cut of the beef, but it is typically cooked for several hours until tender.
