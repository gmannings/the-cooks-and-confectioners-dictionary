# Roasted Conger

## Description
Roasted Conger is a classic dish made with a large fat Conger eel. The eel is prepared by cleaning, scraping off the slime, and splitting it. It is then stuffed with a mixture of beaten nutmeg, parboiled oysters, salt, and stripped thyme. The eel is roasted with the skin on to preserve its flavor and moisture. The gravy from the roasted eel is used to make a delicious sauce with claret wine, wine vinegar, anchovies, beaten butter, and slices of orange. Alternatively, the eel can be cut into pieces and roasted with bay leaves placed between each piece.

## Options and commentary
- Instead of Conger eel, you can use another type of fatty fish such as salmon or mackerel.
- If you don't have access to fresh oysters, you can use canned oysters or omit them altogether.
- The sauce can be customized by adding herbs like parsley or tarragon for extra flavor.
- The roasted eel can be served as a main dish with the sauce on the side, or it can be flaked and used in salads or sandwiches.

## Ingredients:
- 1 large Conger eel (or substitute with salmon or mackerel)
- 1/2 teaspoon grated nutmeg
- 12 large oysters, parboiled (optional)
- Salt to taste
- 1 tablespoon fresh thyme leaves, stripped
- 1 cup claret wine
- 1/4 cup wine vinegar
- 2 anchovies, dissolved in a little warm water
- 2 tablespoons butter, beaten
- 2-3 slices of orange
- Bay leaves (if roasting in pieces)

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F).
2. Clean the Conger eel by removing the innards and washing it thoroughly. Scrape off any slime from the skin.
3. Cut off the fins of the eel and split it lengthwise like an "S".
4. In a small bowl, mix together the grated nutmeg, parboiled oysters (if using), salt, and stripped thyme leaves.
5. Stuff the eel's belly with the nutmeg mixture.
6. If roasting the eel whole, place it on a roasting rack with the skin side up. If roasting in pieces, cut the eel into 3-inch long pieces and place bay leaves between each piece.
7. Roast the eel in the preheated oven for about 25-30 minutes, or until it is cooked through and the skin is crispy.
8. While the eel is roasting, prepare the sauce. In a saucepan, combine the claret wine, wine vinegar, dissolved anchovies, beaten butter, and slices of orange.
9. Bring the sauce to a boil and let it simmer for a few minutes to allow the flavors to meld together.
10. Once the eel is cooked, remove it from the oven and let it rest for a few minutes.
11. Strain the juices from the roasting pan into the saucepan with the sauce.
12. Simmer the sauce for another 5 minutes to thicken slightly.
13. Serve the roasted Conger eel with the sauce on the side or drizzled over the top.

## Cooking time
Approximately 25-30 minutes for roasting the eel. Additional time for preparing the sauce.
