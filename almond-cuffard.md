# Almond Cuffard

## Description
Almond Cuffard is a creamy and rich dessert made with almonds, cream, eggs, and sugar. It is baked until set and then served with a garnish of biscuits and muscadines.

## Options and commentary
- You can use almond flour instead of blanching and grinding whole almonds.
- If you don't have rose water, you can use almond extract for a similar flavor.
- Biscuits can refer to small, sweet cookies or sponge cake. Choose your preferred option.
- Muscadines are a type of grape, but you can use any other sweet grapes as a substitute.
- Double refined sugar can be replaced with powdered sugar.

## Ingredients:
- 450g almond flour (or blanched almonds)
- 2 cups (480ml) rose water (or almond extract)
- 2 liters cream
- 20 egg whites
- 450g fine sugar
- Biscuits (cookies or sponge cake)
- Muscadines or sweet grapes
- Powdered sugar

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F).
2. If using blanched almonds, blanch them by placing them in boiling water for a few minutes, then remove the skins. Grind the almonds in a food processor until very fine.
3. In a large bowl, combine the almond flour (or ground almonds) with the rose water (or almond extract). Mix well until you have a smooth almond paste.
4. Strain the almond paste through a fine-mesh sieve into another large bowl.
5. Add the cream to the almond mixture and stir until well combined.
6. In a separate bowl, whisk the egg whites until they form stiff peaks.
7. Gradually add the fine sugar to the egg whites, continuing to whisk until the mixture is glossy and forms stiff peaks.
8. Gently fold the egg white mixture into the almond and cream mixture until fully incorporated.
9. Pour the custard mixture into individual crusts or cups.
10. Place the cups on a baking sheet and bake in the preheated oven for about 30-40 minutes, or until the custard is set and lightly golden on top.
11. Remove the baked cuffards from the oven and let them cool slightly.
12. Transfer the cuffards to a serving dish or individual plates.
13. Sprinkle biscuits (crumbled cookies or small pieces of sponge cake) over the cuffards.
14. Decorate with muscadines or sweet grapes, placing them on top of the cuffards.
15. Finally, sprinkle double refined sugar (or powdered sugar) over the cuffards for a sweet finishing touch.
