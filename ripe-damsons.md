# Ripe Damsons

## Description
This recipe is for making ripe damsons, a type of plum, into a fermented beverage. The damsons are soaked in warm water to plump them up, then boiled and strained. The resulting liquid is fermented with yeast or the lees of good wine, and then aged in a cool cellar for a few months.

## Ingredients:
- Ripe damsons
- Water
- Yeast or lees of good wine

## Instructions:
1. Place the ripe damsons in a tub.
2. Warm enough water to cover the damsons and pour it over them.
3. Cover the tub with clothes to keep it warm and let it sit for at least a day and a night, until the damsons have plumped up.
4. Add more water to the tub.
5. Boil the damsons and water over a brisk fire for five to six hours.
6. Strain the mixture to remove the damsons.
7. Set the liquid aside to cool.
8. Once the liquid has cooled, add yeast or the lees of good wine to start the fermentation process.
9. Allow the liquid to ferment for a while.
10. Transfer the fermented liquid to a wine cask.
11. Add a few fresh damsons to the cask.
12. Close the cask tightly and store it in a cool cellar for two to three months.

## Cooking time
