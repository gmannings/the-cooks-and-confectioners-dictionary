# Cullis and Ragoo of Mushrooms, Truffles, etc.

## Description
This recipe is for a rich and flavorful sauce called Cullis, along with a Ragoo made with mushrooms, truffles, and other ingredients. The Cullis is a thickened sauce that can be used as a base for other dishes, while the Ragoo is a savory mixture of mushrooms and truffles. These dishes can be served hot and are a great accompaniment to meats or vegetables.

## Ingredients:
- 500g mushrooms (any variety)
- 50g truffles (fresh or canned)
- 2 shallots, finely chopped
- 2 cloves of garlic, minced
- 2 tablespoons butter
- 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
- 500ml chicken or vegetable broth
- Salt and pepper to taste

## Instructions:
1. Clean the mushrooms by wiping them with a damp cloth or paper towel. Slice them into thin pieces.
2. If using fresh truffles, clean them and slice them into thin pieces as well. If using canned truffles, drain and rinse them before slicing.
3. In a large skillet, melt the butter over medium heat. Add the shallots and garlic, and saut√© until they become translucent and fragrant.
4. Add the mushrooms and truffles to the skillet and cook until they release their moisture and start to brown slightly.
5. Sprinkle the flour over the mushrooms and truffles, stirring well to coat them evenly. Cook for another minute to cook off the raw flour taste.
6. Slowly pour in the chicken or vegetable broth, stirring constantly to prevent lumps from forming. Continue stirring until the mixture thickens and comes to a simmer.
7. Reduce the heat to low and let the sauce simmer for about 10 minutes, allowing the flavors to meld together. Season with salt and pepper to taste.
8. Remove from heat and serve the Cullis and Ragoo hot.

## Cooking time
Approximately 30 minutes.
