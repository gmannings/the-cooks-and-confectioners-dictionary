## Description
This recipe is a modernized version of an 18th-century dish that combines a leg of mutton with cucumbers. The mutton is marinated and then cooked with a flavorful ragout made from bacon, flour, and gravy. The dish is hearty and delicious, perfect for a special occasion or a comforting family meal.

## Options and commentary
- You can use lamb instead of mutton if you prefer a milder flavor.
- If you don't have access to fresh cucumbers, you can use pickled cucumbers or zucchini as a substitute.
- Feel free to adjust the seasoning and spices according to your taste preferences.

## Ingredients:
- 1 leg of mutton (or lamb)
- 2 cucumbers
- 100g bacon, diced
- 2 tablespoons flour
- 500ml good quality gravy
- Salt and pepper to taste

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F).
2. Marinate the cucumbers: Peel the cucumbers and slice them into thin rounds. Place the cucumber slices in a bowl and sprinkle them with salt. Let them sit for 15 minutes to draw out excess moisture. Rinse the cucumbers under cold water and pat them dry with a paper towel.
3. Toss the cucumbers: In a large skillet, heat a tablespoon of oil over medium heat. Add the cucumber slices and sauté them for 2-3 minutes until they start to soften. Remove the cucumbers from the skillet and set them aside.
4. Make the ragout: In the same skillet, add the diced bacon and cook until it starts to brown. Sprinkle the flour over the bacon and stir well to combine. Cook for another minute to cook off the raw flour taste.
5. Add the gravy: Slowly pour the gravy into the skillet, stirring constantly to prevent lumps from forming. Bring the mixture to a simmer and cook for 5 minutes until the sauce thickens slightly.
6. Cook the mutton: Place the leg of mutton in a roasting pan and season it with salt and pepper. Pour the prepared ragout over the mutton, covering it completely. Cover the roasting pan with foil and place it in the preheated oven.
7. Roast the mutton: Roast the mutton for approximately 2-3 hours, or until the meat is tender and cooked to your desired level of doneness. Baste the mutton with the cooking juices every 30 minutes to keep it moist.
8. Rest and serve: Once the mutton is cooked, remove it from the oven and let it rest for 10-15 minutes before carving. Serve the mutton slices with the cucumbers and ragout on the side.

## Cooking time
Approximately 2-3 hours.
