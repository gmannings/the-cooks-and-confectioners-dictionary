# Fricasseed Chicken with Champagne Wine

## Description
This recipe is a modernized version of an 18th-century dish called "Fritaller Chickens with Champaign Wine." It features tender chicken cooked in a rich and flavorful sauce made with bacon, butter, truffles, mushrooms, and champagne wine. The dish is finished with a velvety sauce made from egg yolks and veal gravy. It is a luxurious and elegant dish that is perfect for special occasions.

## Ingredients:
- 1 whole chicken, cut into pieces
- 2 slices of bacon, diced
- 2 tablespoons butter
- 4 truffles, sliced
- 8 button mushrooms, sliced
- 4 cockscombs (optional)
- 1 onion, studded with 3-4 cloves
- Salt and pepper to taste
- 2 tablespoons flour
- 1 cup strong chicken broth
- 2 glasses of champagne or sparkling wine
- 3-4 egg yolks
- 1/4 cup veal gravy
- Fresh parsley, finely chopped

## Instructions:
1. Prepare the chicken by cleaning and cutting it into pieces. Remove the skin if desired.
2. In a large stew-pan, cook the diced bacon over medium heat until crispy. Remove the bacon from the pan and set aside.
3. In the same pan, melt the butter over medium heat. Add the sliced truffles, mushrooms, and cockscombs (if using). Cook for 5 minutes, or until the mushrooms are tender.
4. Season the chicken pieces with salt and pepper, then add them to the pan with the mushrooms. Cook until the chicken is browned on all sides.
5. Add the studded onion to the pan and sprinkle in the flour. Stir well to coat the chicken and mushrooms with the flour.
6. Pour in the strong chicken broth and stir to combine. Bring the mixture to a simmer.
7. In a separate saucepan, bring the champagne or sparkling wine to a boil. Let it simmer for a few minutes to reduce slightly.
8. Pour the reduced champagne into the stew-pan with the chicken. Stir well to combine.
9. In a small bowl, whisk together the egg yolks and veal gravy until smooth.
10. Add the egg yolk mixture to the stew-pan, along with the finely chopped parsley. Stir gently to incorporate the sauce into the chicken and mushrooms.
11. Continue cooking the fricassee over low heat until the sauce thickens and coats the back of a spoon. Be careful not to let it boil, as the eggs may curdle.
12. Once the sauce has thickened, remove the pan from the heat and transfer the fricassee to a serving dish.
13. Serve the fricassee hot, garnished with additional parsley, if desired. It can be accompanied by rice, mashed potatoes, or crusty bread.
