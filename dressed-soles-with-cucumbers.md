# Dressed Soles with Cucumbers

## Description
This recipe is for a dish of fried soles served with a sauce made from browned cucumbers. The cucumbers are marinated in vinegar and spices, then browned in butter and simmered in fish broth. The fried soles are added to the sauce and cooked briefly before serving.

## Options and commentary
- Instead of soles, you can use any white fish fillets such as cod or haddock.
- If you prefer a lighter sauce, you can use vegetable broth instead of fish broth.
- The cooking time may vary depending on the thickness of the fish fillets.

## Ingredients:
- 4 sole fillets
- 3-4 cucumbers
- Vinegar
- Salt
- Pepper
- 1 onion
- Butter
- Fish broth or vegetable broth
- Brown sauce or roux made from fried flour

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to a low temperature to keep the fried soles warm while preparing the sauce.

2. Fry the sole fillets according to your preferred method until cooked through. Set them aside to drain.

3. Cut the cucumbers in half lengthwise and remove the seeds. Dice the cucumbers into small pieces.

4. In a bowl, combine the diced cucumbers, vinegar, salt, pepper, and sliced onion. Allow the cucumbers to marinate in this mixture for 2 hours, turning them occasionally.

5. After marinating, drain the cucumbers and pat them dry with a kitchen towel.

6. In a saucepan, melt butter over medium heat. Add the diced cucumbers to the pan and cook until they are browned.

7. Pour in enough fish broth to moisten the cucumbers and reduce the heat to low. Allow the cucumbers to simmer gently for a few minutes.

8. Once the cucumbers are cooked to your desired tenderness, skim off any fat that has risen to the surface of the sauce.

9. Add the brown sauce or roux made from fried flour to the pan to thicken the sauce. Stir well to combine.

10. Place the fried sole fillets into the saucepan with the cucumbers. Let them simmer together for a few minutes to allow the flavors to meld.

11. Transfer the dressed soles with cucumbers to a serving dish. Pour the sauce over the fish and serve immediately.

## Cooking time
Approximately 2 hours marinating time + 30 minutes cooking time.
