# Raspberry Wine

## Description
Raspberry wine is a sweet and fruity alcoholic beverage made from raspberries and sugar. It has a rich flavor and can be enjoyed on its own or used as a base for cocktails.

## Ingredients:
- 2 kg raspberries
- 3.6 kg double-refined sugar

## Instructions:
1. In a large earthenware pan, combine the raspberries and sugar. Stir well to ensure the sugar is evenly distributed.
2. Let the mixture sit for two days, stirring and crushing the raspberries occasionally.
3. After two days, transfer the mixture to a clean, fine-mesh cloth. Hang the cloth over another pan to allow the liquid to drip into it for 24 hours. This will help separate the raspberry juice from the solids.
4. Once the liquid has finished dripping, transfer it to a fermentation vessel with a tap. Allow the liquid to ferment for a week or ten days, making sure to remove any scum that forms on the surface.
5. If the wine appears clear and free from sediment, it is ready to be bottled. Use a siphon or funnel to transfer the wine into clean, sterilized bottles.
6. Let the wine stand in the bottles for a week to allow any remaining sediment to settle. After a week, carefully transfer the wine to fresh bottles, leaving behind the sediment at the bottom.
7. Repeat this process of transferring the wine to fresh bottles two or three times, as long as there is sediment present.
8. Store the raspberry wine in a cool, dark place for at least a month to allow it to mature and develop its flavors.

## Cooking time
Approximately 2 weeks (including fermentation and bottling time)
