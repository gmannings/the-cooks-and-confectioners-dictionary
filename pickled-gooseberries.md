# Pickled Gooseberries

## Description
Pickled gooseberries are a tangy and flavorful condiment that can be enjoyed with a variety of dishes. The gooseberries are first soaked in a saltwater brine to enhance their flavor and preserve their texture. They are then pickled in verjuice, a tart juice made from unripe grapes, which adds a delicious acidity to the berries. This recipe yields a small batch of pickled gooseberries that can be stored for several months.

## Ingredients:
- 500g gooseberries
- 50g salt
- 500ml water
- 500ml verjuice

## Instructions:
1. Rinse the gooseberries and remove any stems or leaves.
2. In a large bowl, combine the salt and water to make a brine. Stir until the salt is dissolved.
3. Place the gooseberries in the brine and let them soak overnight. This will help enhance their flavor and texture.
4. The next day, drain the gooseberries and rinse them thoroughly to remove any excess salt.
5. In a saucepan, heat the verjuice over medium heat until it comes to a simmer.
6. Add the gooseberries to the simmering verjuice and cook for 5 minutes. This will help infuse the berries with the pickling flavors.
7. Using a slotted spoon, transfer the gooseberries to sterilized jars, leaving some space at the top.
8. Pour the hot verjuice over the gooseberries, making sure they are completely covered.
9. Seal the jars tightly and let them cool to room temperature.
10. Once cooled, store the pickled gooseberries in the refrigerator for at least 1 week before using. This will allow the flavors to develop and the berries to fully pickle.
