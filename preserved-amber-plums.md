# Preserved Amber Plums

## Description
Preserved Amber Plums are a sweet and tangy treat made by boiling plums in sugar syrup until they are tender and then drying them. The plums are soaked in a clarified sugar syrup for several days to infuse them with flavor and preserve them. This recipe results in plums that are soft, juicy, and full of flavor.

## Ingredients:
- Plums
- Sugar

## Instructions:
1. Prick the plums with a pin in several places.
2. Place the plums in a pot of cold water and bring it to a boil.
3. Once the plums rise to the top of the water, remove them from the heat and transfer them to a bowl of cold water.
4. Drain the plums and place them in earthen or copper pans.
5. Heat the sugar in a separate pot until it is clarified and pour it over the plums in the pans.
6. Let the plums soak in the clarified sugar syrup overnight.
7. The next day, bring the plums and syrup to a boil again and simmer until the syrup becomes somewhat smooth.
8. Repeat step 7 for the next two days, boiling the syrup until it becomes very smooth and then pearled.
9. On the fourth day, give the plums seven or eight boilings, adding more sugar each time to maintain the same degree of boiling.
10. After each simmering, leave the plums in the earthen or copper pans to soak.
11. Finally, place the pans in a stove or oven to dry the plums.
