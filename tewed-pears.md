# Tewed Pears

## Description
Tewed pears are a classic dessert made by slowly stewing pears in a mixture of water, wine, and spices until they become tender and infused with flavor. The pears are then sweetened with sugar and served with their syrup. This recipe is a modernized version of an 18th-century recipe for tewing pears.

## Ingredients:
- 4 pears (such as Bartlett or Bosc), peeled and cored
- 1 cup water
- 1 cup red wine (such as Claret)
- 2 cinnamon sticks, lightly crushed
- 4 cloves
- 1/4 cup sugar

## Instructions:
1. In a medium-sized pot or saucepan, combine the water and red wine.
2. Add the peeled and cored pears to the pot, making sure they are fully submerged in the liquid.
3. Place the pot over medium heat and bring the liquid to a gentle simmer.
4. Reduce the heat to low and let the pears stew gently for about 2 hours, or until they become tender. Stir occasionally to ensure even cooking.
5. After about 1 hour of cooking, add the crushed cinnamon sticks and cloves to the pot. This will infuse the pears with warm, aromatic flavors.
6. When the pears are almost tender, add the sugar to the pot and stir until it dissolves completely. The sugar will sweeten the pears and create a syrup.
7. Continue to cook the pears for another 10-15 minutes, or until they are fully tender and the syrup has thickened slightly.
8. Remove the pot from the heat and let the pears cool slightly in the syrup.
9. Once cooled, carefully transfer the pears to a deep plate or serving dish, arranging them in a single layer.
10. Pour the syrup over the pears, making sure to cover them completely.
11. Serve the tewed pears warm or at room temperature, spooning some of the syrup over each serving.
