# Lamb Collar

## Description
Lamb Collar is a traditional dish made by rolling a boneless side of lamb with a flavorful seasoning mixture, bacon, and then boiling it until tender. It is then served with a fragrant broth and can be enjoyed hot or cold.

## Ingredients:
- 1 boneless side of lamb
- Salt
- Pepper
- Nutmeg
- Savory herbs (such as thyme, rosemary, or oregano), finely chopped
- Lemon peel
- Slices of bacon
- Water
- Fennel
- Parsley roots
- Ginger, sliced
- Nutmeg
- 1 quart (950 ml) white wine
- 6 bay leaves
- Peel of 1 lemon
- Slices of lemon

## Instructions:
1. Remove the bones from the side of lamb and place it in a large bowl or container. Cover the lamb with salted water and let it soak for a while to remove any excess blood. Then, pat the lamb dry with paper towels.
2. In a small bowl, mix together salt, pepper, nutmeg, and the finely chopped savory herbs.
3. Sprinkle the seasoning mixture evenly over the lamb, making sure to cover all sides. Grate the lemon peel over the lamb to add a citrusy flavor.
4. Lay the slices of bacon over the seasoned lamb, covering it completely.
5. Roll up the lamb tightly into a collar shape, making sure the bacon stays in place. Use kitchen twine to tie the collar securely.
6. Prepare a large pot of water and add salt to it. Bring the water to a boil.
7. Carefully place the lamb collar into the boiling water. Skim off any foam or impurities that rise to the surface.
8. Add fennel, parsley roots, sliced ginger, and nutmeg to the pot. Let the lamb collar simmer in the seasoned water for about 1 hour or until it is tender.
9. After the lamb collar has simmered, pour in the white wine and continue to cook for another 15 minutes.
10. Finally, add the bay leaves, lemon peel, and slices of lemon to the pot. Cover the pot and let the flavors meld together for a few minutes.
11. Remove the lamb collar from the pot and let it cool slightly before unwrapping the cloth and removing the twine.
12. Serve the lamb collar hot or cold, sliced into rounds, with some of the flavorful broth and garnished with the lemon slices and bay leaves.
