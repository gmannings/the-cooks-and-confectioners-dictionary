# Baked Wild Boar Leg

## Description
This recipe is for baking a leg of wild boar. The leg is seasoned and larded with a mixture of spices, then baked in a pie crust. The dish is rich and flavorful, perfect for a special occasion or a festive meal.

## Options and commentary
- If you can't find wild boar, you can use pork leg as a substitute.
- The spices used in the recipe are pepper, ginger, and nutmeg. Adjust the amount according to your taste preference.
- The leg can be soaked in the spice mixture for two days and then parboiled, or you can skip the soaking step and directly parboil the leg.
- The pie crust should be thick and strong to hold the boar leg and the filling.

## Ingredients:
- 1 leg of wild boar (or pork leg)
- Lard (for larding)
- Pepper
- Ginger
- Nutmegs
- Pie crust (fine, strong, thick)

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F).
2. Season the leg of wild boar (or pork leg) with pepper, ginger, and nutmeg. Rub the spices all over the leg, ensuring it is well coated.
3. If soaking the leg: Place the seasoned leg in a container and cover it with the spice mixture. Let it soak in the refrigerator for two days.
4. If not soaking the leg: Skip to step 5.
5. Parboil the leg: Place the leg in a large pot and cover it with water. Bring the water to a boil and let the leg simmer for about 20 minutes. This will partially cook the leg and help remove any gamey flavors.
6. Remove the leg from the pot and let it cool slightly.
7. Roll out the pie crust and line a pie dish with it. Make sure the crust is thick and strong to hold the leg and the filling.
8. Place the parboiled leg in the pie dish, removing any bones if necessary.
9. Sprinkle some of the spice mixture over the leg. Add whole cloves and bay leaves on top.
10. Lay slices of lard over the leg and dot it with a good amount of butter.
11. Cover the pie dish with another layer of pie crust, sealing the edges well.
12. Make a small vent in the top crust to allow steam to escape during baking.
13. Place the pie dish in the preheated oven and bake for about 2 to 3 hours, or until the crust is golden brown and the leg is cooked through.
14. Every 30 minutes, open the oven and baste the leg with fresh butter to keep it moist.
15. Once baked, remove the pie from the oven and let it rest for a few minutes before serving.
16. Serve the baked wild boar leg hot, slicing it into portions along with the pie crust.
