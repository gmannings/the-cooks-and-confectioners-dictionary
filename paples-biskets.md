# Paples Biskets

## Description
Paples Biskets are a type of sweet biscuit made with flour, eggs, sugar, rosewater, and caraway seeds. They are baked until golden and glazed with a sugar-water mixture.

## Ingredients:
- 450 grams of fine flour
- 8 eggs
- 450 grams of double refined loaf sugar
- 2 tablespoons of damask rosewater
- 28 grams of caraway seeds
- Water
- Additional sugar for glazing

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 180Â°C.
2. In a mixing bowl, combine the fine flour, double refined loaf sugar, and caraway seeds.
3. In a separate bowl, beat the eggs until well mixed.
4. Gradually add the beaten eggs to the dry ingredients, mixing well after each addition.
5. Add the damask rosewater to the mixture and continue to mix until a thick batter is formed. If the batter is too thick, add small amounts of water until the desired consistency is reached.
6. Grease tin-pans with butter or cooking spray.
7. Pour the batter into the prepared tin-pans, filling them about three-quarters full.
8. Place the tin-pans in the preheated oven and bake for approximately 20-25 minutes, or until the biskets are golden brown and cooked through.
9. While the biskets are baking, prepare the glaze by dissolving additional sugar in water. The amount of sugar used will depend on personal preference for sweetness.
10. Once the biskets are baked, remove them from the oven and immediately brush the tops with the sugar-water glaze.
11. Allow the biskets to cool completely before serving.

## Cooking time
Approximately 20-25 minutes.
