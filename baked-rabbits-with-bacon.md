# Baked Rabbits with Bacon

## Description
This recipe is for a classic dish of baked rabbits, seasoned with bacon and other flavorful ingredients. The rabbits are first larded with bacon and then layered with vegetables and herbs. They are then baked in the oven or under a baking cover. The dish is served with a savory sauce called Saingaraz, made with bacon, gravy, vinegar, and herbs.

## Options and commentary
- Instead of rabbits, you can use chicken or any other poultry of your choice.
- You can add other vegetables like mushrooms or bell peppers to the dish for added flavor and texture.
- The Saingaraz sauce can be adjusted to your taste by adding more or less vinegar and herbs.

## Ingredients:
- 2 rabbits (or chicken)
- 200g bacon, sliced into lardons
- 100g lean ham, diced
- 200g veal, sliced
- 1 onion, sliced
- Fresh herbs (such as parsley, chives, and thyme)
- 2 carrots, sliced
- 2 parsnips, sliced
- Salt and pepper
- 500ml good quality gravy
- 2 tablespoons flour
- 2 tablespoons vinegar

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F).
2. Cut the livers of the rabbits into quarters and lard them with the bacon lardons and diced ham.
3. In a stewpan, arrange a layer of bacon slices at the bottom. Add a layer of veal slices on top, followed by sliced onions, herbs, carrots, and parsnips. Season with salt and pepper.
4. Place the larded rabbit quarters on top of the vegetables. Repeat the layering process with the remaining vegetables, bacon, veal, and herbs.
5. Cover the stewpan with a lid or aluminum foil and place it in the preheated oven. Alternatively, you can use a baking cover with fire both over and under the stewpan.
6. While the rabbits are baking, prepare the Saingaraz sauce. Cut some slices of bacon and beat them well. In a separate pan, melt a little bacon fat and add the flour. Cook for a minute to make a roux. Gradually add the gravy, stirring constantly to avoid lumps. Add a bunch of fresh herbs and let the sauce simmer.
7. After the rabbits are baked enough, remove them from the stewpan and let them drain. Transfer the rabbits to the Saingaraz sauce and let them simmer for a few minutes.
8. Serve the baked rabbits with the Saingaraz sauce poured over them as a first course.
