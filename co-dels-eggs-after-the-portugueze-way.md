# Co dels Eggs after the Portugueze Way

## Description
Co dels Eggs is a traditional Portuguese dessert made with egg yolks, sugar, and citrus flavors. It is a sweet and creamy dish with a delicate texture. The eggs are cooked in a mixture of sugar, orange-flower water, lemon juice, and a pinch of salt. Once cooked, they are chilled and then shaped into a pyramid. The dish is garnished with march-pane (almond paste) and lemon peel.

## Ingredients:
- 200g sugar
- 50ml orange-flower water
- Juice of 2 lemons
- Pinch of salt
- 8 egg yolks
- March-pane (almond paste)
- Lemon peel, for garnish

## Instructions:
1. In a saucepan, dissolve the sugar in the orange-flower water, lemon juice, and salt over medium heat. Stir until the sugar is completely dissolved.
2. In a separate bowl, whisk the egg yolks until well beaten.
3. Slowly pour the sugar mixture into the beaten egg yolks, whisking continuously to prevent the eggs from curdling.
4. Return the mixture to the saucepan and cook over low heat, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon or a silicone spatula. Continue cooking until the mixture thickens and coats the back of the spoon. This should take about 10-15 minutes.
5. Remove the saucepan from the heat and let the mixture cool to room temperature.
6. Once cooled, transfer the mixture to the refrigerator and chill for at least 2 hours, or until set.
7. Take the chilled mixture and shape it into a pyramid using a spoon or a piping bag.
8. Garnish the pyramid with pieces of march-pane and lemon peel.
9. Serve chilled.
