# Pickled Plum Buds

## Description
This recipe is for pickling plum buds, a traditional method of preserving plums in the 18th century. The plum buds are first boiled in a saltwater solution, then strained and pickled in a mixture of white wine, egg whites, mace, and pepper. The pickled buds are then boiled multiple times until they turn green and are finally sealed with paper and leather.
