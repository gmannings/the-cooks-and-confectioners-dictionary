# Fricassee of Tongues

## Description
Fricassee of Tongues is a dish made from tender boiled tongues that are sliced and fried in butter. They are then simmered in a flavorful broth or gravy seasoned with various herbs and spices. The dish is finished with a thickening agent such as grated bread or almond paste and can be garnished with whole grapes or barberries. This recipe can also be used to fricassee udder, which is boiled until tender.

## Ingredients:
- 2 boiled tongues
- Butter for frying
- 2 cups strong broth or gravy
- Salt
- Pepper
- Nutmeg
- Thyme
- Savory
- Sweet marjoram
- Parsley, chopped
- 2 egg yolks
- 2 tablespoons white wine vinegar or grape verjuice
- Whole grapes or barberries for garnish
- Grated bread or almond paste for thickening
- Saffron (optional)

## Instructions:
1. Boil the tongues until tender. Remove from the water and let them cool slightly.
2. Cut the boiled tongues into thin slices.
3. Heat a frying pan over medium heat and melt a generous amount of butter.
4. Fry the tongue slices in the butter until they are golden brown on both sides. Remove the tongues from the pan and set them aside.
5. Pour out the excess butter from the pan.
6. Add the strong broth or gravy to the pan and bring it to a simmer.
7. Season the broth or gravy with salt, pepper, nutmeg, thyme, savory, sweet marjoram, and chopped parsley. Stir well to combine.
8. Allow the mixture to simmer for a few minutes to let the flavors meld together.
9. In a separate bowl, whisk together the egg yolks and white wine vinegar or grape verjuice.
10. Slowly pour the egg yolk mixture into the simmering broth or gravy, stirring constantly to prevent curdling.
11. Add whole grapes or barberries to the pan for added flavor and garnish.
12. If desired, add grated bread or almond paste to thicken the sauce. Stir well to incorporate.
13. Optional: Add a pinch of saffron for color and flavor.
14. Allow the fricassee to simmer for a few more minutes until the sauce has thickened and the flavors have melded together.
15. Serve the fricassee of tongues hot, garnished with whole grapes or barberries.

## Cooking time
Approximately 1-2 hours, depending on the tenderness of the tongues.
