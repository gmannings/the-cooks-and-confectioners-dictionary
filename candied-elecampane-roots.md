# Candied Elecampane Roots

## Description
Candied elecampane roots are a sweet treat made from the roots of the elecampane plant. The roots are cooked in a sugar syrup until they become candied and then dried. They have a sweet and slightly floral flavor.

## Ingredients:
- 1 pound elecampane roots
- 1.75 pounds sugar

## Instructions:
1. Take the elecampane roots out of the syrup and wash off the sugar. Dry them with a clean cloth.
2. In a saucepan, combine the sugar with enough water to make a syrup. Heat over medium heat until the sugar is completely dissolved.
3. Increase the heat to high and bring the syrup to a boil. Continue boiling until the syrup reaches the candy stage, which is around 300°F (150°C) on a candy thermometer.
4. Carefully dip the elecampane roots into the hot syrup, making sure they are fully coated. Use a fork or tongs to handle the roots to avoid burning yourself.
5. Place the coated roots on a wire rack or parchment paper to cool and dry. Allow them to dry completely, which may take several hours or overnight.
6. Once the candied roots are dry, store them in an airtight container to keep them fresh.
