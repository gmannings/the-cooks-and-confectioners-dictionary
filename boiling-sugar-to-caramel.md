# Boiling Sugar to Caramel

## Description
This recipe provides instructions on how to boil sugar to its caramel stage. Caramelized sugar is a versatile ingredient used in various sweet dishes and desserts.

## Options and commentary
- You can use granulated sugar for this recipe.
- Be careful when working with hot sugar as it can cause severe burns. Use caution and keep children away from the cooking area.

## Ingredients:
- Granulated sugar

## Instructions:
1. Place a heavy-bottomed saucepan over medium heat.
2. Add the granulated sugar to the saucepan.
3. Stir the sugar constantly with a heat-resistant spatula or wooden spoon until it starts to melt and turn into a liquid.
4. Continue stirring until the sugar completely melts and turns into a golden-brown liquid. Be careful not to let it burn.
5. To test if the sugar has reached the caramel stage, carefully drop a small amount of the caramelized sugar into a bowl of cold water. It should harden and become brittle.
6. If the caramelized sugar sticks to your teeth when you bite it, it needs to be cooked longer. Continue cooking and stirring until it reaches the desired consistency.
7. Once the caramelized sugar reaches the desired stage, immediately remove it from the heat to prevent it from burning.
8. Use the caramelized sugar as desired in recipes or allow it to cool and harden to use as a garnish or candy.

## Cooking time
Approximately 10-15 minutes, depending on the heat level and desired consistency.
