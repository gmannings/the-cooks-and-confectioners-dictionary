# Rofe Winegar

## Description
Rofe Winegar is a type of flavored vinegar made with dried roses. It was commonly used in the 18th century as a condiment or ingredient in various dishes.

## Options and commentary
- You can use any type of vinegar for this recipe, but white wine vinegar or apple cider vinegar work well.
- If you don't have access to dried roses, you can use rose petals or rose water as a substitute.
- The amount of roses and vinegar can be adjusted based on the size of the container you are using.

## Ingredients:
- Dried roses
- Vinegar (white wine vinegar or apple cider vinegar)

## Instructions:
1. Preheat your oven to a low temperature (around 50Â°C) or find a sunny spot to place your container of vinegar.
2. Place the dried roses into a clean glass jar or bottle.
3. Pour the vinegar over the roses, making sure they are fully submerged.
4. If using an oven, place the jar or bottle in the warm oven for several hours. If using the sun, place the container in a sunny spot for a few weeks.
5. Check the vinegar regularly. When the vinegar has absorbed the flavor of the roses, strain out the old roses and discard them.
6. Add fresh dried roses to the jar or bottle and fill it up again with vinegar.
7. Repeat the process of allowing the vinegar to infuse with the roses in the sun or warm oven.
8. Continue this process until the desired flavor is achieved. This may take several rounds of infusing.
9. Once the vinegar has reached the desired flavor, strain out the roses and transfer the flavored vinegar to a clean bottle or jar for storage.
