# Candied Pears

## Description
Candied pears are a sweet and delicious treat made by simmering pears in a sugar syrup until they become soft and infused with sweetness. This recipe provides a modernized version of an 18th-century recipe for candied pears.

## Ingredients:
- 4 pears
- 1 cup granulated sugar
- 1 cup water

## Instructions:
1. Peel the pears, removing the skin and core. Cut them into quarters or slices, whichever you prefer.
2. In a medium-sized saucepan, combine the sugar and water. Stir until the sugar is dissolved.
3. Add the pears to the saucepan with the sugar syrup.
4. Place the saucepan over medium heat and bring the syrup to a gentle boil.
5. Reduce the heat to low and simmer the pears in the syrup for about 20-30 minutes, or until they become soft and translucent.
6. As the pears cook, skim off any foam or scum that rises to the surface.
7. Once the pears are soft and have absorbed the sugar syrup, remove them from the heat.
8. Allow the pears to cool in the syrup for a few minutes.
9. Using a slotted spoon, transfer the candied pears to a plate or serving dish, leaving behind the syrup.
10. Serve the candied pears as a sweet treat on their own, or use them as a topping for desserts like ice cream or cakes.

## Cooking time
Approximately 20-30 minutes.
