# Turkish-Style Stewed Mutton

## Description
This recipe is a modern adaptation of an 18th-century dish called "To diels Mutton the Turkish Way." It features thinly sliced mutton stewed with rice, vinegar, onions, and whole pepper. The dish is flavorful and comforting, with a hint of tanginess from the vinegar. It is traditionally served with sippets, which are small pieces of toasted bread.

## Ingredients:
- 500g mutton, thinly sliced
- 2 tablespoons vinegar
- 1 cup rice
- 1 teaspoon whole pepper
- 2-3 onions, sliced
- Sippets (to serve)

## Instructions:
1. In a large bowl, combine the thinly sliced mutton with vinegar. Let it marinate for 15-20 minutes.
2. In a pot or saucepan with a tight-fitting lid, add the marinated mutton, rice, whole pepper, and sliced onions.
3. Fill the pot with enough water to cover the ingredients.
4. Place the pot on the stove over medium heat and bring it to a simmer.
5. Skim off any foam or impurities that rise to the surface.
6. Reduce the heat to low, cover the pot, and let the mutton stew for about 1.5-2 hours, or until the meat is tender and the rice is cooked.
7. Occasionally check the pot and add more water if needed to prevent it from drying out.
8. Once the mutton is cooked, remove the onions from the pot and discard them.
9. Serve the Turkish-style stewed mutton in bowls, garnished with sippets (toasted bread).

## Cooking time
Approximately 1.5-2 hours.
