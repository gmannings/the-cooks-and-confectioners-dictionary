# Terrine

## Description
Terrine is a traditional French dish that is typically made with a combination of meats, vegetables, and herbs, cooked in a loaf-shaped dish called a terrine. This recipe is a modernized version of an 18th-century terrine recipe, which includes various ingredients stewed together and served with a thickened broth.

## Options and commentary
- You can customize the ingredients in the terrine based on your preferences. Common choices include pork, veal, chicken, or game meats, along with vegetables like carrots, onions, and mushrooms.
- You can add herbs and spices such as thyme, rosemary, or bay leaves to enhance the flavor of the terrine.
- The traditional method of baking the terrine in the oven for half an hour is provided, but you can also choose to serve it without baking, by pouring hot broth over the top when serving.

## Ingredients:
- Assorted meats (e.g., pork, veal, chicken, game meats)
- Assorted vegetables (e.g., carrots, onions, mushrooms)
- Herbs and spices (e.g., thyme, rosemary, bay leaves)
- Bread slices
- Lard
- Green peas
- Broth
- Sweetbread (optional)

## Instructions:
1. Prepare the meats by cutting them into small pieces. 
2. Prepare the vegetables by chopping them into small dice.
3. In a large pot, stew the meats and vegetables together over low heat until they are cooked through and tender.
4. Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F) if you choose to bake the terrine.
5. Once the meats and vegetables are cooked, transfer them to a terrine dish or a deep dish with a rim.
6. Soak the bread slices in some of the broth and lard. Remove the fat from the broth before soaking the bread.
7. Place the soaked bread on top of the meat and vegetable mixture in the terrine dish.
8. If using, place a larded sweetbread in the middle under the bread slices.
9. Fold the breast of a chicken over the bread slices before adding them to the dish.
10. Fill the terrine dish, leaving some space at the top for the thickened broth.
11. In a separate pot, thicken the remaining broth with green peas. You can strain the peas with a little good broth or use a cullis to thicken it.
12. Pour the thickened broth over the top of the terrine, ensuring it reaches the level of the bread.
13. If baking, place the terrine in the preheated oven and bake for approximately 30 minutes, or until the bread and cullis form a crust on top.
14. If not baking, skip the previous step and serve the terrine as is.
15. Serve the terrine hot, either directly from the oven or by pouring hot cullis over the top.

## Cooking time
- Stewing the meats and vegetables: approximately 1 hour
