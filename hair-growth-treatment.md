# Hair Growth Treatment

## Description
This recipe is a traditional remedy for promoting hair growth. It involves using a combination of powdered hazelnuts, elecampane leaves, beech mast, and honey to create a paste that is applied to the scalp.

## Ingredients:
- 50g hazelnuts
- 10g elecampane leaves
- 10g beech mast
- 50g honey

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F).
2. Spread the hazelnuts on a baking sheet and roast them in the oven for about 10 minutes, or until they are golden brown and fragrant.
3. Remove the hazelnuts from the oven and let them cool completely.
4. Once cooled, place the roasted hazelnuts in a blender or food processor and blend until they form a fine powder. Set aside.
5. In a mortar and pestle, crush the elecampane leaves and beech mast together until they are well combined and form a paste-like consistency.
6. In a small saucepan, heat the honey over low heat until it becomes liquid.
7. Remove the saucepan from the heat and add the elecampane and beech mast paste to the honey. Stir well to combine.
8. Add the powdered hazelnuts to the honey mixture and mix until you have a thick paste.
9. Allow the mixture to cool slightly before applying it to the scalp.
10. Using your fingers or a clean brush, apply the paste to the areas of the scalp where the hair is thin.
11. Gently massage the paste into the scalp for a few minutes to ensure it is evenly distributed.
12. Leave the paste on the scalp for at least 30 minutes, or overnight if desired.
13. Rinse the hair and scalp thoroughly with warm water to remove the paste.
14. Repeat this treatment 2-3 times a week for best results.
