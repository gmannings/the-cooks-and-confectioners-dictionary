# Herring Pie

## Description
Herring Pie is a traditional dish made with pickled herrings, minced herring flesh, and a variety of other ingredients. The pie is filled with a flavorful mixture of minced herring, bread, dates, rose-water, sugar, sack (a type of fortified wine), and saffron. It is then baked until golden and served with a tangy vinegar, butter, and sugar sauce.

## Ingredients:
- 4 pickled herrings
- 2 herring roes
- 50g grated white bread
- 8 dates, pitted and chopped
- 1 tablespoon rose-water
- 1 tablespoon sugar
- 1 tablespoon sack (fortified wine)
- A pinch of saffron
- Butter, for greasing
- 100g gooseberries
- 50g currants
- Vinegar, for serving
- Sugar, for serving

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F).
2. Rinse the pickled herrings under cold water to remove excess salt. Remove the skins from the herrings and set them aside.
3. In a bowl, combine the minced herring flesh and herring roes. Add the grated white bread, chopped dates, rose-water, sugar, sack, and saffron. Mix well until you have a stiff paste.
4. Take the herring skins and fill them with the prepared paste. Make sure to pack the paste tightly into the skins.
5. Grease the bottom of a pie dish with butter. Place the filled herring skins in the dish.
6. Add the gooseberries and currants on top of the herring skins.
7. Dot the top of the pie with small pieces of butter.
8. Cover the pie dish with a lid or pastry crust, sealing the edges well.
9. Place the pie in the preheated oven and bake for approximately 45 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown.
10. Once the pie is cooked, remove it from the oven and let it cool slightly.
11. In a small saucepan, heat a mixture of vinegar, butter, and sugar until the sugar has dissolved.
12. Pour the vinegar, butter, and sugar mixture over the pie, allowing it to soak into the crust and filling.
13. Serve the Herring Pie warm, with the tangy vinegar, butter, and sugar sauce on the side.
