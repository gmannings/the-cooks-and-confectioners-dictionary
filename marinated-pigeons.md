# Marinated Pigeons

## Description
This recipe is for marinated pigeons that are then fried and served hot. The pigeons are marinated in a mixture of lemon juice, verjuice or vinegar, salt, pepper, cloves, bay leaf, and chibbols (spring onions). After marinating, the pigeons are either coated in a paste or flour and then fried until cooked. They are served with fried parsley on top and accompanied by rape vinegar and white pepper.

## Ingredients:
- 2 pigeons
- Juice of 1 lemon
- 2 tablespoons verjuice or vinegar
- Salt, to taste
- Pepper, to taste
- 4 cloves
- 1 bay leaf
- 2 spring onions
- Flour, for coating
- Oil, for frying
- Fresh parsley, for garnish
- Rape vinegar, for serving
- White pepper, for serving

## Instructions:
1. In a bowl, combine the lemon juice, verjuice or vinegar, salt, pepper, cloves, bay leaf, and chopped spring onions to make the marinade.
2. Cut the pigeons into quarters or butterfly them by cutting along the back to allow the marinade to penetrate the flesh.
3. Place the pigeons in the marinade and let them marinate for 2-3 hours.
4. After marinating, remove the pigeons from the marinade and pat them dry.
5. If using a paste coating, prepare the paste according to your preferred recipe. Coat the pigeons in the paste, making sure they are evenly coated.
6. If using flour, lightly coat the pigeons in flour, shaking off any excess.
7. Heat oil in a frying pan over medium heat.
8. Fry the pigeons gently in the hot oil until they are cooked through and golden brown on all sides. This should take about 10-15 minutes.
9. Once cooked, remove the pigeons from the pan and place them on a paper towel-lined plate to drain excess oil.
10. Garnish the pigeons with fried parsley.
11. Serve the marinated pigeons hot, accompanied by rape vinegar and white pepper on the side.

## Cooking time
Approximately 2-3 hours for marinating, 10-15 minutes for frying.
