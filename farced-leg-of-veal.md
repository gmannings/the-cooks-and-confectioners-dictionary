# Farced Leg of Veal

## Description
This recipe is for a farced (stuffed) leg of veal, prepared in the French style. The leg of veal is deboned and filled with a mixture of minced veal, beef suet, sweet herbs, spices, hard-boiled eggs, pine nuts, chestnuts, artichoke pieces, and raw eggs. The stuffed leg is then boiled and served with a flavorful broth, garnished with various ingredients such as artichokes, pine nuts, chestnuts, and hard-boiled egg yolks. The dish is typically accompanied by French bread and fried toasts.

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 180째C (350째F) if roasting the leg of veal, or prepare a large pot for boiling if boiling the leg of veal.
2. In a large mixing bowl, combine the minced veal, beef suet, chopped sweet herbs, salt, pepper, nutmeg, ginger, cloves, and minced garlic. Mix well to combine.
3. Add the hard-boiled eggs, pine nuts, chopped chestnuts, artichoke pieces, and raw eggs to the mixture. Mix until all the ingredients are evenly distributed.
4. Stuff the mixture into the deboned leg of veal, ensuring it is evenly filled. Sew up the opening of the leg to secure the stuffing.
5. If roasting: Place the stuffed leg of veal on a roasting rack in a roasting pan. Roast in the preheated oven for approximately 1.5 to 2 hours, or until the internal temperature reaches 70째C (160째F).
6. If boiling: Place the stuffed leg of veal in the large pot filled with water and white wine. Bring to a boil and skim off any impurities that rise to the surface. Reduce the heat to a simmer and cook for approximately 2 hours, or until the leg is cooked through.
7. While the leg of veal is cooking, prepare the garnishes. In a separate pot, combine some of the broth from the cooking liquid, whole mace blades, artichoke bottoms, pine nuts, chopped chestnuts, and marrow (if using). Simmer until the garnishes are tender.
8. In a frying pan, melt some butter and fry the slices of French bread until golden brown and crispy. Set aside.
9. Once the leg of veal is cooked, remove it from the oven or pot and let it rest for a few minutes.
10. To serve, place the leg of veal on a platter lined with French bread slices and fried toasts. Ladle some of the cooking broth over the leg of veal. Arrange the garnishes, such as the cooked mace blades, artichoke bottoms, pine nuts, chestnuts, and slices of lemon and lemon peel, on top of the leg of veal.
11. Melt some butter and drizzle it over the leg of veal and garnishes.
12. Serve the farced leg of veal hot with additional broth on the side.
