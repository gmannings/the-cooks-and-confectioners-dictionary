# Tó dels Gerries in Ears

## Description
Tó dels Gerries in Ears is a recipe from the 18th century that involves preserving cherries by joining them together in pairs. The cherries are opened and spread apart, with their skins on the outside and the pulp on the inside. Another cherry of the same nature is added on each side, with its pulp laid upon the skin of the others. This method helps to preserve the cherries and create an interesting presentation.

## Ingredients:
- Cherries

## Instructions:
1. Wash and dry the cherries.
2. Take one cherry and carefully make a small incision around the stem end, being careful not to cut all the way through.
3. Gently open the cherry by pulling apart the two halves, keeping the skin intact on the outside and the pulp on the inside.
4. Take another cherry of the same size and variety and repeat the process, opening it and keeping the skin intact on the outside.
5. Place the opened cherry halves together, with the skins touching on the outside and the pulps facing each other on the inside.
6. Repeat the process with more cherries until you have pairs of cherries joined together.
7. Store the joined cherries in a jar or container, making sure they are packed tightly to prevent them from separating.
8. Repeat the process with the remaining cherries.
9. Seal the jar or container and store it in a cool, dark place to preserve the cherries.
