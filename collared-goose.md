# Collared Goose

## Description
Collared Goose is a traditional dish made by boning and rolling the goose meat, then boiling it in a flavorful broth. The meat is then sliced and served with a garnish of minced Westphalia bacon. It is a rich and savory dish that makes for a delicious main course.

## Options and commentary
- Instead of goose, you can use duck or chicken as a substitute.
- If you prefer a stronger flavor, you can marinate the meat for longer than 12 hours.
- You can add additional herbs and spices to the broth for extra flavor.

## Ingredients:

## Instructions:
1. Bone the goose by carefully removing the bones while keeping the meat intact. Cut the flesh into square pieces.

4. Spread small pieces of anchovies and minced Westphalia ham over the goose pieces.
5. Roll up the goose pieces tightly and secure them with kitchen twine or toothpicks.
6. In a large pot, bring the strong broth and white wine to a boil. Add whole mace and pepper to the broth for extra flavor.
7. Carefully place the rolled goose in the boiling broth and let it cook for about 2-3 hours, or until the meat is tender.
