# Frically of Tenches with White Sauce

## Description
This recipe is for a fricassée of tenches, a type of freshwater fish, served with a white sauce. The fish is cooked with mushrooms, truffles, artichoke bottoms, and a variety of seasonings. The sauce is thickened with eggs and flavored with nutmeg and parsley.

## Options and commentary
- Tenches: If tenches are not available, you can substitute with another firm-fleshed fish such as trout or catfish.
- Mushrooms: Any type of mushrooms can be used, such as button mushrooms or cremini mushrooms.
- Truffles: Truffles are optional and can be omitted if not available.
- Artichoke bottoms: Canned or jarred artichoke bottoms can be used for convenience.
- White wine: Choose a dry white wine for the sauce, such as Sauvignon Blanc or Chardonnay.
- Verjuice: Verjuice is the juice of unripe grapes and can be difficult to find. You can substitute with a small amount of lemon juice or white wine vinegar.

## Ingredients:
- 1.5 kg tenches, cleaned and cut into pieces
- 200g mushrooms, sliced
- 100g truffles, sliced (optional)
- 200g artichoke bottoms, sliced
- 50g butter
- Salt and pepper to taste
- 1 onion, studded with cloves
- 1 bouquet garni (a bundle of herbs such as thyme, parsley, and bay leaves)
- 200ml hot water
- 30g all-purpose flour
- 250ml white wine
- 3-4 egg yolks
- 1 tablespoon verjuice or boiled white wine
- 1/4 teaspoon grated nutmeg
- 2 tablespoons minced parsley

## Instructions:
1. Clean the tenches by removing the slime and cutting off their heads. Split them down the back and cut each side into three pieces.
2. In a large saucepan, melt the butter over medium heat. Add the tenches, mushrooms, truffles (if using), and artichoke bottoms.
3. Season with salt and pepper and add the onion studded with cloves and the bouquet garni.
4. Toss the ingredients together and then add the hot water and flour. Stir well to combine.
5. Pour in the white wine and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to low and simmer until a significant amount of liquid has evaporated.
6. In a separate bowl, beat the egg yolks with the verjuice or boiled white wine.
7. Slowly pour the egg mixture into the fricassée, stirring constantly to thicken the sauce.
8. Add the grated nutmeg and minced parsley. Stir well to incorporate.
9. Serve the fricassée hot, garnished with additional parsley if desired.
