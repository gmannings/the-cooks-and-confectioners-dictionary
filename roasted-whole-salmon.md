# Roasted Whole Salmon

## Description
This recipe involves roasting a whole salmon with a flavorful stuffing of herbs, onions, garlic, and oysters. The salmon is basted with butter and cooked in the oven until tender. The pan drippings are used to make a rich gravy that is poured over the salmon before serving.

## Ingredients:
- 1 whole salmon (approximately 2 kg)
- Fresh herbs (such as thyme, rosemary, winter savory, and sweet marjoram)
- 1 small onion
- 2 cloves of garlic
- Pickled herrings or a salted eel (for larding)
- Large oysters (approximately 12)
- Nutmeg
- Butter
- Claret wine (approximately 250 ml)
- Anchovies
- Pepper
- Tin dripping pan

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 180Â°C.
2. Clean the salmon by removing the gills and any innards. Rinse the salmon under cold water and pat dry.
3. Prepare the stuffing by finely chopping the fresh herbs, onion, and garlic. Mix them together in a bowl.
4. Stuff the salmon's belly cavity with the herb mixture.
5. Scale the salmon by scraping off the slime from the skin.
6. Lard the salmon by inserting strips of pickled herrings or salted eel into the flesh.
7. Season the large oysters with grated nutmeg.
8. Fill the salmon's belly cavity with the seasoned oysters.
9. Baste the salmon with melted butter.
10. Place the salmon on a rack in a tin dripping pan.
11. Put the pan in the preheated oven and roast the salmon for approximately 20 minutes per 500 grams of fish, or until the flesh is opaque and flakes easily with a fork.
12. While the salmon is roasting, prepare the sauce. In a saucepan, combine the claret wine, anchovies, pepper, and grated nutmeg. Simmer the mixture over low heat until the flavors meld together.
13. Once the salmon is cooked, remove it from the oven and carefully turn it over to roast the other side.
14. Pour the claret wine mixture into the dripping pan under the salmon, allowing the gravy to collect.
15. Return the salmon to the oven and continue roasting for another 10-15 minutes.
16. Remove the salmon from the oven and transfer it to a serving platter.
17. Strain the pan drippings to remove any fat. Pour the drippings into a saucepan and bring to a boil.
18. Thicken the gravy by whisking in butter until it reaches a desired consistency.
19. Pour the gravy over the roasted salmon.
20. To serve, cut open the belly of the salmon and remove some of the oysters. Add the oysters to the sauce.
21. Remove the herbs from the salmon and discard.
22. Serve the roasted salmon hot.
