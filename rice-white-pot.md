# Rice White-pot

## Description
Rice White-pot is a creamy and sweet rice pudding that was popular in the 18th century. It is made by boiling rice in milk until tender, then pounding it with almonds. The rice and almond mixture is then combined with a creamy custard made from cream, eggs, and sugar. The pudding is flavored with mace and rosewater, and baked in the oven until set. It is often garnished with candied citron and orange peel.

## Options and commentary
- You can use any type of rice for this recipe, but long-grain white rice works best.
- If you don't have a mortar and pestle, you can use a food processor to pound the rice and almonds together.
- Feel free to adjust the amount of sugar and rosewater to suit your taste.
- You can substitute other types of nuts, such as cashews or pistachios, for the almonds if desired.
- If you can't find candied citron and orange peel, you can use other candied fruits or simply omit the garnish.
