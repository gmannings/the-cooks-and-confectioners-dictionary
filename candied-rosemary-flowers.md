# Candied Rosemary Flowers

## Description
Candied rosemary flowers are a sweet and fragrant treat. The flowers are soaked in a mixture of gum-dragant and rose water, then coated in sugar and left to dry in the sun until they become candy-like. They can be enjoyed on their own or used as a decorative element in desserts.

## Ingredients:
- 1 cup rosemary flowers
- 1/4 cup gum-dragant
- 1/4 cup rose water
- 1 cup sugar

## Instructions:
1. In a small bowl, combine the gum-dragant and rose water. Stir until the gum-dragant is dissolved.
2. Place the rosemary flowers in the gum-dragant mixture and let them soak for 10 minutes.
3. Remove the rosemary flowers from the mixture and place them on a piece of parchment paper.
4. Sprinkle sifted sugar over the rosemary flowers, making sure they are evenly coated.
5. Place the parchment paper with the rosemary flowers in a sunny spot.
6. Every few hours, turn the rosemary flowers and sprinkle more sugar over them.
7. Continue this process until the rosemary flowers are sufficiently candied and dry.
8. Once the flowers are dry, store them in an airtight container for future use.

## Cooking time
Approximately 1-2 days, depending on the intensity of the sun.
