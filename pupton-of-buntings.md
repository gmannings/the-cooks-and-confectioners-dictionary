# Pupton of Buntings

## Description
Pupton of Buntings is a dish made with small birds (buntings) that are trussed, larded, and cooked in a stew with sweetbreads, mushrooms, chestnuts, and a flavorful gravy. The dish is then encased in a pastry crust and baked until golden and crispy. It is a rich and savory dish that was popular in the 18th century.

## Options and commentary
- Instead of buntings, you can use small game birds such as quail or partridge.
- If you prefer not to use sweetbreads, you can substitute them with chicken or veal.
- You can use a combination of different mushrooms such as cremini, shiitake, or oyster mushrooms.
- For the pastry crust, you can use store-bought puff pastry or make your own from scratch.

## Ingredients:
- 4 small game birds (such as quail or partridge)
- 8 slices of bacon
- 200g sweetbreads, cut into large pieces
- 200g mushrooms (such as cremini, shiitake, or oyster), cleaned and sliced
- 100g chestnuts, blanched
- 50g butter
- 2 tablespoons flour
- 2 onions, peeled and left whole
- 500ml gravy or broth
- Salt and pepper to taste
- Pinch of nutmeg
- 1 lemon
- 1 orange
- Fresh parsley, for garnish
- 1 sheet of puff pastry or pie crust

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F).
2. Truss the game birds by tying their legs together with kitchen twine. 
3. In a large skillet, fry the bacon until crispy. Remove the bacon from the skillet and set aside.
4. In the same skillet, fry the sweetbreads until golden brown. Remove and set aside.
5. Add the sliced mushrooms to the skillet and cook until they release their moisture and start to brown. Remove and set aside.
6. In a saucepan, melt the butter over medium heat. Add the flour and cook, stirring constantly, until it turns golden brown.
7. Slowly pour in the gravy or broth, stirring continuously to avoid lumps. Add the whole onions to the saucepan.
8. Bring the mixture to a simmer and cook for 5 minutes, until the sauce thickens slightly.
9. Season the sauce with salt, pepper, and nutmeg to taste.
10. Add the cooked sweetbreads, mushrooms, and blanched chestnuts to the sauce. Stir to combine.
11. Remove the bacon, cloves, and whole onion from the skillet used to fry the ingredients. Squeeze in the juice of one lemon.
12. Place the game birds in a baking dish, breast side down. Pour the cooled ragout mixture over the birds.
13. Roll out the puff pastry or pie crust to fit the size of the baking dish. Place the pastry over the dish, covering the birds and ragout completely.
14. Press the pastry firmly against the sides of the dish to seal it.
15. Brush the pastry with beaten egg and sprinkle with grated bread.
16. Bake in the preheated oven for approximately 1 hour, or until the pastry is golden brown and crispy.
17. Remove the dish from the oven and let it cool for a few minutes.
18. Carefully loosen the pastry from the sides of the dish with a knife. Invert the dish onto a serving platter, so the pastry is on the bottom.
19. Squeeze the juice of one orange over the dish.
20. Garnish with fried parsley and serve.
