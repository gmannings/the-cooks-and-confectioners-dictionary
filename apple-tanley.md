# Apple Tanley

## Description
Apple Tanley is a sweet and creamy dessert made with fried apples, eggs, cream, and flavored with spinach juice, tansy juice, and rose water.

## Options and commentary
- You can use any variety of apples that are good for cooking, such as Granny Smith or Golden Delicious.
- If you don't have tansy juice, you can omit it or substitute with a small amount of lemon juice for a tangy flavor.
- The spinach juice is used for color and can be omitted if desired.
- Rose water can be found in specialty stores or online, but if you can't find it, you can substitute with a small amount of vanilla extract.

- 2 tablespoons unsalted butter

- 1 teaspoon rose water (or substitute with vanilla extract)

## Instructions:
1. Heat a large skillet over medium heat and melt the butter.
