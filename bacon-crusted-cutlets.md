# Bacon-Crusted Cutlets

## Description
Bacon-Crusted Cutlets are a delicious and flavorful dish made by coating cutlets in a mixture of melted bacon, herbs, salt, and pepper, and then broiling them to perfection. The bacon adds a smoky and savory flavor, while the herbs and seasonings enhance the taste. These cutlets are perfect for a quick and satisfying meal.

## Ingredients:
- 4 pork or chicken cutlets
- 4 slices of bacon
- 1 tablespoon of mixed herbs (such as thyme, rosemary, and parsley)
- Salt and pepper, to taste
- 1/2 cup of breadcrumbs
- Gravy, for serving

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the broiler in your oven.
2. Cook the bacon in a skillet over medium heat until crispy. Remove the bacon from the skillet and let it cool.
3. Once the bacon is cool, crumble it into small pieces.
4. In a bowl, combine the crumbled bacon, mixed herbs, salt, and pepper.
5. Dip each cutlet into the melted bacon fat in the skillet, coating both sides.
6. Press the bacon-herb mixture onto both sides of each cutlet, ensuring an even coating.
7. Sprinkle breadcrumbs over the coated cutlets, pressing them gently to adhere.
8. Place the cutlets on a broiler pan or a baking sheet lined with aluminum foil.
9. Broil the cutlets for about 4-5 minutes on each side, or until they are cooked through and the bacon crust is crispy and golden.
10. Remove the cutlets from the oven and let them rest for a few minutes before serving.
11. Serve the bacon-crusted cutlets with gravy on the side.
