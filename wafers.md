# Wafers

## Description
Wafers are thin, crispy cookies that can be enjoyed on their own or used as a base for other desserts. This recipe provides instructions for making wafers using a wafer iron.

## Ingredients:
- 250g all-purpose flour
- 500ml cream
- 150g granulated sugar
- 1 tablespoon orange flower water
- Butter, for greasing the wafer iron

## Instructions:
1. In a mixing bowl, combine the flour and cream. Stir well to remove any lumps. Let the mixture sit overnight.
2. After the mixture has rested, add the sugar to the bowl and mix well with a spoon.
3. Gradually pour in more cream and orange flower water, stirring continuously, until the batter reaches a thin consistency, similar to milk. Mix well.
4. Preheat the wafer iron and grease both sides with butter.
5. Place a corner of a napkin on the wafer iron to catch any excess batter.
6. Pour a spoonful and a half of batter onto the wafer iron for each wafer.
7. Close the wafer iron and cook the wafers on one side until they reach a good color.
8. Open the wafer iron slightly to check the color. Once the wafers are done, remove them from the iron using a knife and roll them slightly.
9. Place the hot wafers on a wooden roller designed for shaping them.
10. Transfer the shaped wafers to a stove or a low-temperature oven to keep them dry and crisp.

## Cooking time
- Preparing the batter: Overnight
- Cooking time for each wafer: Approximately 2-3 minutes per side
