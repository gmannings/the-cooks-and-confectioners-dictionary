# Lamb's Head Stew

## Description
This recipe is for a traditional lamb's head stew, where the head is stuffed with a mixture of lamb, beef suet, bread, herbs, and eggs. The stuffed head is then stewed in a flavorful broth, and meatballs are made from the remaining mixture. This dish is rich and hearty, perfect for a special occasion or a comforting meal.

## Ingredients:
- 1 lamb's head
- 200g lamb meat, minced
- 200g beef suet, minced
- 100g bread, grated
- Salt, to taste
- Pepper, to taste
- Fresh herbs (such as parsley, thyme, and rosemary), minced
- 4-5 eggs
- 1 liter strong broth (such as beef or vegetable)

## Instructions:
1. Remove the brains from the lamb's head and set them aside.
2. In a bowl, combine the minced lamb meat, minced beef suet, grated bread, salt, pepper, minced herbs, and raw eggs. Mix well to combine.
3. Take the reserved lamb's brains and boil them until cooked. Once cooled, cut them into small pieces.
4. Stuff the lamb's head with the mixture from step 2, including the cooked brains.
5. In a large stew-pan, pour in the strong broth. Place the stuffed lamb's head in the pan.
6. Bring the broth to a simmer and cook the lamb's head over low heat for about 2-3 hours, or until the meat is tender and cooked through. Occasionally baste the head with the broth to keep it moist.
7. While the lamb's head is stewing, shape the remaining minced meat mixture into small meatballs.
8. After the lamb's head has cooked for about 2 hours, add the meatballs to the stew-pan and continue cooking for an additional 30 minutes, or until the meatballs are cooked through.
9. Serve the lamb's head stew hot, with some of the broth and meatballs.
