# Boiled Hog's Umbles

## Description
This recipe is for boiled hog's umbles, which are the edible organs of a hog such as the liver, lights (lungs), and heart. The umbles are boiled until tender and then minced along with other ingredients to create a flavorful stuffing mixture. The mixture is then stuffed into hog's guts and boiled again. This dish was popular in the 18th century and is a unique way to use different parts of the hog.

## Ingredients:
- Umbles (liver, lights, and heart) of a hog
- Sinews (from the umbles)
- 4-5 egg yolks
- 1 pint of cream
- 1/4 pint of Canary wine (a type of sweet white wine)
- Nutmeg (finely powdered)
- Cloves (finely powdered)
- Mace (finely powdered)
- Cinnamon (finely powdered)
- Sugar
- Caraway seeds
- Rose-water
- Hog's fat
- Salt
- Hog's guts (for stuffing)

## Instructions:

2. Remove some of the lights and heart from the boiled umbles, along with any flesh attached to them.
3. Take out the sinews from the umbles and mince the rest of the umbles very small.
4. Mince the liver as well.
5. In a bowl, combine the minced umbles, minced liver, sinews, and the following ingredients: egg yolks, cream, Canary wine, nutmeg, cloves, mace, cinnamon, sugar, caraway seeds, a little rose-water, a good quantity of hog's fat, and some salt. Mix well to combine all the ingredients.
6. Roll the mixture into a cylindrical shape and let it rest for about two hours.
7. Rinse the hog's guts with rose-water.
8. Stuff the mixture into the hog's guts, making sure to fill them evenly.
9. Tie the ends of the stuffed guts securely.
10. Place the stuffed guts in a pot of boiling water and cook for a further period of time until the guts are fully cooked and the stuffing is heated through.
11. Remove the stuffed guts from the water and let them cool slightly before serving.
