# Roasted Turkey

## Description
This recipe is for roasting a turkey with a flavorful herb and butter stuffing. The turkey is basted with butter and drudged with flour to create a crispy and golden skin. It is served with a tangy anchovy sauce and garnished with slices of lemon.

## Ingredients:
- 1 turkey (size of your choice)
- Fresh herbs (such as thyme, rosemary, and sage)
- 100g butter
- Spices (such as salt, pepper, and paprika)
- 2 tablespoons flour
- Anchovy sauce
- Lemon slices

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F).
2. Clean and prepare the turkey by removing the giblets and excess fat. Pat dry with paper towels.
3. Finely chop the fresh herbs and mix them with the butter in a bowl.
4. Season the herb butter mixture with spices of your choice, such as salt, pepper, and paprika.
5. Stuff the herb butter mixture into the cavity of the turkey, ensuring it is evenly distributed.
6. Tie the legs of the turkey together with kitchen twine to keep the stuffing in place.
7. Place the turkey on a roasting rack in a roasting pan.
8. Roast the turkey in the preheated oven for approximately 20 minutes per pound (45 minutes per kilogram) or until the internal temperature reaches 75°C (165°F) when measured with a meat thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the thigh.
9. While the turkey is roasting, baste it every 30 minutes with melted butter to keep it moist and add flavor.
10. About 30 minutes before the turkey is done, sprinkle the flour evenly over the skin to create a crispy crust. Continue roasting until the turkey is fully cooked and the skin is golden brown.
11. Remove the turkey from the oven and let it rest for 20-30 minutes before carving.
12. Serve the roasted turkey with anchovy sauce and garnish with slices of lemon.

## Cooking time
The cooking time will vary depending on the size of the turkey, but as a general guideline, it will take approximately 20 minutes per pound (45 minutes per kilogram) at 180°C (350°F).
