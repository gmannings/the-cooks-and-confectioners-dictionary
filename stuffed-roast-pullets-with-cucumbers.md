# Stuffed Roast Pullets with Cucumbers

## Description
This recipe is for stuffed roast pullets served with cucumbers. The pullets are deboned and stuffed with a flavorful mixture of ham, veal, mushrooms, herbs, and spices. The cucumbers are hollowed out and filled with the same stuffing mixture. The pullets are then roasted until golden and served with the stuffed cucumbers, topped with a rich sauce.

## Options and commentary
- You can use chicken breasts instead of pullets if desired.
- If you prefer a vegetarian option, you can replace the meat with a mixture of vegetables and grains.
- The cooking time may vary depending on the size of the pullets or chicken breasts.

## Ingredients:
- 2 pullets or chicken breasts
- 4 slices of ham
- 200g veal fillet
- 100g mushrooms
- 2 tablespoons chives, finely chopped
- 2 tablespoons parsley, finely chopped
- 1 French roll, crust removed and soaked in cream
- 2 egg yolks
- Salt and pepper to taste
- Spices (such as nutmeg, cloves, or allspice) to taste
- Fresh herbs (such as thyme, rosemary, or sage) to taste
- 4 cucumbers
- Flour for sealing
- 500ml veal or chicken broth
- 100ml ham stock
- 100ml veal or chicken stock

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 180째C (350째F).
2. Using your fingers, carefully lift the skin of the pullet breasts and remove the flesh, including the breast bone.
3. Prepare the stuffing mixture by finely chopping the ham, veal, mushrooms, chives, and parsley.
4. In a bowl, combine the chopped ingredients with the soaked French roll (squeeze out excess cream), egg yolks, salt, pepper, spices, and fresh herbs. Mix well until all the ingredients are evenly incorporated.
5. Stuff the pullet breasts with a portion of the stuffing mixture, leaving some for the cucumbers.
6. Tie up the pullets with kitchen twine and wrap them with bacon slices and parchment paper, securing them with skewers.
7. Place the pullets on a roasting rack and roast in the preheated oven for about 45 minutes to 1 hour, or until the internal temperature reaches 75째C (165째F).
8. While the pullets are roasting, prepare the cucumbers. Cut off the ends of the cucumbers and scoop out the seeds to create a hollow cavity.
9. Fill the hollowed cucumbers with the remaining stuffing mixture and seal the openings with flour paste.
10. Blanch the stuffed cucumbers in boiling water for a few minutes, then remove and drain.
11. In a stewpan, heat the veal or chicken broth and add the blanched cucumbers. Simmer gently for about 15 minutes.
12. In a separate saucepan, combine the ham stock and veal or chicken stock. Heat over medium heat until warmed through.
13. Remove the cucumbers from the stewpan and place them in the saucepan with the stock mixture. Cook for a few more minutes.
14. Once the pullets are cooked, remove them from the oven and let them rest for a few minutes. Remove the bacon wrapping and untie the twine.
15. Place the pullets on a serving dish and arrange the stuffed cucumbers around them.
16. Pour the ham and stock mixture over the pullets and cucumbers.
17. Serve hot and enjoy!
