The pie is filled with a mixture of seasoned veal, asparagus tops, boiled veal sweetbreads, quartered hard-boiled eggs, artichokes or potatoes, quartered chestnuts, and interlarded bacon. The filling is mixed with marrow and baked in a pie crust. The pies are then brushed with beaten butter for added richness.
