# Preserved Medlars

## Description
Preserved Medlars are a sweet and tangy fruit preserve made from medlars, a fruit that was popular in the 18th century. The medlars are scalded to remove the skin, then the stones are removed. They are then cooked with sugar and wine to create a syrupy preserve.

## Ingredients:
- Medlars
- Water
- Double-refined sugar
- Tent (a type of fortified wine)

## Instructions:
1. Fill a pot with water and bring it to a boil.
2. Add the medlars to the boiling water and let them cook for a few minutes until the skin can be easily peeled off.
3. Remove the medlars from the boiling water and let them cool slightly.
4. Peel off the skin from the medlars.
5. Cut off the head of each medlar and remove the stones.
6. In a separate pot, combine the double-refined sugar and tent in the ratio of 1 pound of sugar and 1 pint of tent for each pound of medlars.
7. Place the pot with the sugar and tent mixture on the stove and heat it over medium heat until the sugar has dissolved completely.
8. Add the peeled and deseeded medlars to the pot with the sugar and tent mixture.
9. Bring the mixture to a boil and then reduce the heat to low.
10. Simmer the medlars in the syrup for about 30 minutes, or until the syrup has thickened and coats the back of a spoon.
11. Remove the pot from the heat and let the preserved medlars cool completely.
12. Transfer the preserved medlars and syrup to sterilized jars.
13. Seal the jars tightly and store them in a cool, dark place.
