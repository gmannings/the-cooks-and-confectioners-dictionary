# Modernized Calf's Head

## Description
This modernized version of Calf's Head is a rich and flavorful dish that combines tender pieces of calf's head with a variety of ingredients such as claret, lemon peel, herbs, mushrooms, and oysters. The head is first boiled, then divided into two parts - one part is stewed in a strong gravy, while the other part is larded with bacon and broiled. The stewed meat is then combined with a flavorful sauce made from gravy, anchovies, mushrooms, capers, butter, and oysters. The dish is garnished with barberries and horseradish for added flavor and served as a main course.

## Options and commentary
- Instead of using a whole calf's head, you can use pre-cut calf's head pieces or substitute with other cuts of meat such as veal.
- If you prefer a milder flavor, you can omit the anchovies or reduce the amount.
- The garnish of barberries and horseradish adds a tangy and spicy element to the dish, but you can omit them if desired.

## Ingredients:
- 1 calf's head, halved
- 1/4 cup claret (red wine)
- 1 lemon, peel sliced
- 1 small onion, sliced
- 1/4 teaspoon grated nutmeg
- Handful of fresh herbs (such as parsley, thyme, and rosemary)
- 1 cup strong beef or veal gravy
- 3 anchovies, chopped
- 1 cup mushrooms, sliced
- 2 tablespoons capers
- 4 tablespoons butter
- 1 cup large oysters, drained (reserve a few for frying)
- 1 blade of mace
- 2 eggs, beaten
- 2 tablespoons flour
- 4 slices bacon, crisped
- Sausages or meatballs (optional)
- Barberries and horseradish, for garnish

## Instructions:
1. Place the calf's head in a large pot and cover with water. Bring to a boil and cook until the tongue can be easily peeled. This will take approximately 1-2 hours.
2. Once the head is cooked, remove it from the pot and allow it to cool slightly. Peel the tongue and set it aside.
3. Cut one half of the head into pieces about the size of oysters.
4. In a stewing pan, heat a little oil or butter and add the cut pieces of calf's head. Cook them in a strong gravy and claret, along with the lemon peel, onion, nutmeg, and fresh herbs. Stew until the meat is tender.
5. Meanwhile, take the other half of the head and score it with a knife. Lard it with bacon and brush it with beaten egg yolks. Sprinkle grated bread, herbs, and lemon peel over the larded head.
6. Broil the larded head over a charcoal or wood-coal fire until cooked through and nicely browned. This will take approximately 15-20 minutes.
7. Once the larded head is cooked, place it in the middle of a serving dish.
8. Return the stewed meat to the stewing pan and add the strong gravy, anchovies, mushrooms, capers, butter, and a quart of large oysters. Keep a few oysters aside for frying. Add the blade of mace and simmer until the flavors are well combined.
9. In a separate bowl, mix the beaten eggs and flour to make a batter. Dip the reserved oysters in the batter and fry them in hot lard until golden brown. Set aside.
10. Cut the cooked tongue into round pieces and shape the brains into small cakes. Dip them in the beaten eggs and fry until golden brown.
11. Pour the stewed meat and sauce over the larded head in the serving dish. Arrange the fried oysters, bacon, sausages or meatballs (if using), tongue, and brain cakes around the meat.
12. Garnish the dish with barberries and horseradish.
13. Serve the modernized Calf's Head as a main course.
