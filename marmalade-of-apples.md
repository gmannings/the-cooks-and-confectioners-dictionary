# Marmalade of Apples

## Description
Marmalade of Apples is a sweet spread made from cooked and strained apples, mixed with sugar and simmered until thickened. It is similar to apple jam or jelly and can be used as a topping for toast, scones, or as a filling for pastries.

## Options and commentary
- You can use any variety of apples for this recipe, but tart apples like Granny Smith or Bramley work well.
- Adjust the amount of sugar according to your taste preference. You can use less sugar if you prefer a less sweet marmalade.
- This recipe yields approximately 1 pound of marmalade.

## Ingredients:
- 1 kg apples
- 750 g sugar
- Fine sugar for dusting

## Instructions:
1. Wash the apples and remove the cores and stems. Cut the apples into quarters or smaller pieces.
2. Place the apple pieces in a large pot and add enough water to cover them.
3. Bring the water to a boil and let the apples simmer until they are tender. This will take about 15-20 minutes.
4. Once the apples are tender, remove them from the pot and drain them.
5. Pass the cooked apples through a sieve or food mill to remove the skins and create a smooth puree.
6. In a separate pot, add the sugar and heat it over medium heat until it melts and starts to caramelize. Stir continuously to prevent burning.
7. Once the sugar has caramelized and turned a golden brown color, add the apple puree to the pot.
8. Stir the mixture well to combine the sugar and apple puree.
9. Reduce the heat to low and let the mixture simmer gently for about 1 hour, stirring occasionally. The marmalade will thicken as it cooks.
10. While the marmalade is simmering, prepare your pots or glasses by sterilizing them. Wash them thoroughly and place them in a pot of boiling water for a few minutes. Remove and let them dry completely.
11. After 1 hour of simmering, check the consistency of the marmalade. It should be thick and glossy. If it is still too runny, continue simmering for a bit longer.
12. Once the marmalade has reached the desired consistency, remove it from the heat and let it cool slightly.
13. Spoon the marmalade into the sterilized pots or glasses, leaving a small gap at the top.
14. Sprinkle a layer of fine sugar on top of the marmalade to help preserve it.
15. Seal the pots or glasses with lids and let the marmalade cool completely before storing it in the refrigerator.
16. The marmalade can be stored in the refrigerator for up to 2 months.
