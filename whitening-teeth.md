# Whitening Teeth

## Description
This recipe provides a method for whitening teeth using oil of vitriol (sulfuric acid) and a coarse cloth.

## Ingredients:
- Oil of vitriol (sulfuric acid)
- Coarse cloth

## Instructions:
1. Put on protective gloves and safety goggles before handling sulfuric acid.
2. Wet a small corner of the coarse cloth with a drop of oil of vitriol.
3. Gently rub the wet corner of the cloth on the surface of the teeth.
4. Be careful to avoid contact with the gums or any sensitive areas of the mouth.
5. Rinse the mouth thoroughly with water after the treatment.
6. Dispose of the cloth safely, as it may contain traces of sulfuric acid.

## Options and commentary
- It is important to exercise caution when using sulfuric acid. It is a highly corrosive substance and can cause severe burns if mishandled. It is recommended to consult with a dentist or dental professional before attempting any teeth whitening treatments at home.
- There are many modern teeth whitening options available, such as whitening toothpaste, whitening strips, and professional dental treatments. These options are generally safer and more effective than using sulfuric acid.
