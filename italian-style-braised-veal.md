# Italian-Style Braised Veal

## Description
This recipe is a modernized version of an 18th-century dish called "To duels Weal the Italian Way." It features tender veal slices that are seasoned, braised, and served with a flavorful sauce made with mushrooms, truffles, sweetbreads, and other ingredients. The dish is rich and savory, perfect for a special occasion or a fancy dinner.

## Options and commentary
- Instead of veal, you can use chicken or pork as a substitute.
- If you don't have access to mushrooms or truffles, you can use other types of flavorful mushrooms or omit them altogether.
- The dish can be served with mashed potatoes, rice, or pasta to soak up the delicious sauce.

## Ingredients:
- 500g veal slices (or substitute with chicken or pork)
- 4 slices of bacon
- Salt and pepper to taste
- 200g mushrooms, sliced
- 50g truffles, sliced (optional)
- 2 veal sweetbreads, blanched and sliced
- 4 cockscombs, blanched (optional)
- 1 bunch of fresh herbs (such as thyme, rosemary, and parsley)
- 2 slices of lemon
- 1 shallot, finely chopped
- 1 tablespoon flour
- 500ml good quality gravy or stock
- A few drops of verjuice (or substitute with lemon juice)
- 1 tablespoon bread crumbs (optional, for thickening the sauce)

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 160°C (320°F).

2. Season the veal slices with salt and pepper, then lightly pound them with a meat mallet or the back of a knife to tenderize them.

3. Line the bottom of a large, oven-safe stew-pan with the bacon slices.

4. Arrange the veal slices on top of the bacon, making sure they are evenly spaced.

5. Season the veal slices with additional salt and pepper.

6. Cover the veal slices with more bacon slices, completely covering them.

7. Cover the stew-pan with a lid or aluminum foil to create a tight seal.

8. Place the stew-pan in the preheated oven and cook for about 2 hours, or until the veal is tender and cooked through.

9. Once the veal is cooked, remove the bacon slices and the veal from the stew-pan. Set them aside.

10. Drain off the excess fat from the stew-pan, leaving about 2 tablespoons of fat.

11. Place the stew-pan on the stovetop over medium heat.

12. Sprinkle the flour into the stew-pan and stir it into the remaining fat to create a roux.

13. Cook the roux for a minute or two, until it turns golden brown.

14. Gradually pour in the gravy or stock, stirring constantly to prevent lumps from forming.

15. Add the mushrooms, truffles, veal sweetbreads, cockscombs, fresh herbs, lemon slices, shallot, and verjuice to the stew-pan.

16. Stir everything together and bring the sauce to a simmer.

17. Reduce the heat to low and let the sauce simmer for about 10 minutes, allowing the flavors to meld together.

18. If desired, sprinkle in the bread crumbs to thicken the sauce. Stir well to incorporate.

19. Return the veal slices to the stew-pan and coat them with the sauce.

20. Cook for an additional 5 minutes, or until the veal is heated through.

21. Remove the stew-pan from the heat and skim off any excess fat from the surface of the sauce.

22. Serve the Italian-style braised veal hot, garnished with fresh herbs if desired.
