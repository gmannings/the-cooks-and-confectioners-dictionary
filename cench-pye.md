# Cench Pye

## Description
Cench Pye is a traditional 18th-century pie made with tench, a type of freshwater fish. The pie is flavored with spices, currants, and claret wine, and topped with melted butter and sugar. It is a savory-sweet dish that can be served as a main course or as a dessert.

## Ingredients:
- 6 tench fillets
- Butter
- Nutmeg
- Cinnamon
- Mace
- Blue currants (alternatively, you can use raisins or dried cranberries)
- 60 ml Claret wine (approximately 1/4 cup)
- Melted butter
- Fine sugar

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F).

2. Prepare the crust for the pie. You can use your favorite pie crust recipe or store-bought pie crust.

3. Roll out the pie crust and line a pie dish with it. Trim any excess crust.

4. In a small bowl, mix together nutmeg, cinnamon, and mace. Set aside.

5. Spread a layer of butter on the bottom of the pie crust.

6. Sprinkle half of the spice mixture over the butter.

7. Place the tench fillets on top of the spices.

8. Sprinkle the remaining spice mixture over the tench fillets.

9. Scatter the blue currants (or raisins/dried cranberries) over the spices.

10. Pour the Claret wine over the filling.

11. Cover the pie with a top crust or lattice crust. Seal the edges of the crust.

12. Place the pie in the preheated oven and bake for approximately 45 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown and the filling is cooked through.

13. Remove the pie from the oven and let it cool for a few minutes.

14. Pour melted butter over the top of the pie.

15. Dust the pie with fine sugar.

16. Serve the Cench Pye warm as a main course or allow it to cool completely and serve it as a dessert.
