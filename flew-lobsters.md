# Flew Lobsters

## Description
Flew Lobsters is a dish made with lobster cooked in a flavorful mixture of vinegar, claret (red wine), butter, salt, and nutmeg. The lobster is stewed until it becomes somewhat dry, then it is served in a dish with melted butter poured over it and garnished with slices of lemon.

## Ingredients:
- 2 lobsters
- 1/4 cup vinegar
- 1/4 cup claret (red wine)
- 2 tablespoons butter
- Salt, to taste
- 1/4 teaspoon nutmeg
- Butter, for serving
- Lemon slices, for garnish

## Instructions:
1. Fill a large pot with water and bring it to a boil.
2. Add the lobsters to the boiling water and cook for about 8-10 minutes, or until the shells turn bright red.
3. Remove the lobsters from the pot and let them cool slightly.
4. Once the lobsters are cool enough to handle, crack the shells and remove the meat. Cut the lobster meat into bite-sized pieces.
5. In a stew-pan, combine the vinegar, claret, butter, salt, and nutmeg. Heat the mixture over medium heat until the butter is melted.
6. Add the lobster meat to the stew-pan and stir to coat it with the sauce.
7. Reduce the heat to low and simmer the lobster for about 5-7 minutes, or until the sauce has thickened slightly and the lobster is cooked through.
8. Remove the stew-pan from the heat and transfer the lobster to a serving dish.
9. Pour melted butter over the lobster.
10. Garnish the dish with slices of lemon.
11. Serve the flew lobsters hot.
