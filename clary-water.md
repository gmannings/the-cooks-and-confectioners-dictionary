# Clary Water

## Description
Clary Water is a refreshing and aromatic beverage made with beer, clary, raisins, aniseeds, and other ingredients. It was commonly consumed in the 18th century for its supposed health benefits, particularly for the stomach and heart.

## Ingredients:
- 7.6 liters of good middling Beer
- 6-7 handfuls of Clary leaves (approximately 60-70 grams)
- 907 grams of Sun-dried Raisins
- 85 grams of Anniseeds
- 85 grams of Liquorice
- 8 Egg whites
- 2 white Loaves (bread)
- 340 grams of white Sugar-candy
- 340 grams of fine Sugar (powdered)

## Instructions:
1. In a large brass pot, pour in the beer.
2. Add the clary leaves, raisins, anniseeds, and liquorice to the pot.
3. In a separate bowl, beat the egg whites until well beaten.
4. Break the bottoms of the two white loaves into small pieces and add them to the beaten egg whites.
5. Mix the beaten egg whites and bread pieces with the beer mixture in the pot.
6. Place the pot on the stove and heat it over low heat. Allow the mixture to simmer gently for about 1 hour, stirring occasionally.
7. After 1 hour, remove the pot from the heat and let it cool slightly.
8. Set up an alembic or a distillation apparatus according to the manufacturer's instructions.
9. Transfer the cooled mixture into the alembic or distillation apparatus.
