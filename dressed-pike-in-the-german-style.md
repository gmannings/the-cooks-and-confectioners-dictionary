# Dressed Pike in the German Style

## Description
This recipe is for a traditional German-style dressed pike. The pike is first gutted, cleaned, and then split in two. It is then partially boiled and scaled until it becomes white. The fish is then stewed with white wine, capers, anchovies, mushrooms, thyme, sweet herbs, truffles, and morels. A piece of butter and grated cheese are added to thicken the sauce. The dish is garnished and served hot.

## Options and commentary
- Instead of pike, you can use any firm white fish such as cod or haddock.
- Feel free to adjust the amount of capers, anchovies, mushrooms, and herbs according to your taste preferences.
- The garnish can be chosen based on personal preference, such as lemon slices, parsley, or fresh herbs.
