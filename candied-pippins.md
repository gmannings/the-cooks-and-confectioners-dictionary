# Candied Pippins

## Description
Candied Pippins are a sweet and fragrant treat made from large Pippin apples. The apples are peeled, cored, and then baked with sugar and rosewater until they become candied. The final result is a deliciously sweet and chewy apple candy.

## Ingredients:
- 4 large Pippin apples
- 200g refined sugar
- 2 tablespoons rosewater

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 180Â°C.
2. Peel the Pippin apples and remove the cores. Use a small knife or an apple corer to bore a hole through the center of each apple.
3. Place the prepared apples in an earthenware dish.
4. Sprinkle the refined sugar evenly over the apples.
5. Drizzle the rosewater over the apples.
6. Place the dish with the apples in the preheated oven.
7. Bake the apples for approximately 30 minutes, or until they are tender and the sugar has melted.
8. After 30 minutes, remove the dish from the oven and set it aside to cool for a few minutes.
9. Transfer the candied apples to a wire rack and allow them to dry for 3-4 days. Make sure they are placed in a cool, dry area.

## Cooking time
Approximately 30 minutes baking time, followed by 3-4 days of drying time.
