# Portugal Cakes

## Description
Portugal Cakes are a traditional 18th century dessert made with butter, eggs, sugar, flour, currants, and mace. They are small, sweet cakes that are perfect for tea time or as a sweet treat.

## Ingredients:
- 900g unsalted butter
- 12 eggs (8 whole eggs and 4 egg whites)
- 900g sifted granulated sugar
- 900g all-purpose flour
- 450g currants
- 1 tsp ground mace

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F).
2. In a large mixing bowl, cream together the butter and eggs until well combined.
3. Add the sifted sugar to the butter and egg mixture and mix until smooth.
4. Gradually add the flour to the mixture, mixing well after each addition.
5. Stir in the currants and ground mace until evenly distributed throughout the batter.
6. Grease your cake pans with butter.
7. Fill the pans with the batter, leaving some room for the cakes to rise.
8. Place the pans in the preheated oven and bake for approximately 20-25 minutes, or until the cakes are golden brown and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.
9. Remove the cakes from the oven and allow them to cool in the pans for a few minutes.
10. Transfer the cakes to a wire rack to cool completely before serving.
