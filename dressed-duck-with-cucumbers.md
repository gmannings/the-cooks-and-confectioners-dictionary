# Dressed Duck with Cucumbers

## Description
This recipe is for a dressed duck served with cucumbers. The duck is first braised and then served with marinated and cooked cucumbers. The dish is finished with a rich gravy made from veal and bacon. 

## Ingredients:
- 1 duck
- 2 cucumbers
- Vinegar
- Pepper
- Salt
- 2-3 onions
- Bacon
- Gravy (can be made from veal and bacon)

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to the desired temperature for braising the duck.
2. Dress the duck by removing any excess fat or feathers and trussing it if desired.
3. Place the duck in a braising pan or roasting pan and add enough liquid (such as water or broth) to partially cover the duck.
4. Braise the duck in the preheated oven until it is cooked through and tender. The cooking time will depend on the size of the duck, but it is typically around 2-3 hours.
5. While the duck is braising, prepare the cucumbers. Peel the cucumbers and cut them in half lengthwise. Remove the seeds and cut the cucumbers into thin slices.
6. In a bowl, combine the sliced cucumbers with vinegar, pepper, salt, and sliced onions. Allow the cucumbers to marinate in this mixture for at least two hours.
7. After marinating, squeeze the cucumbers in a cloth to remove excess liquid.
8. In a pan, melt some bacon and add the squeezed cucumbers. Cook the cucumbers in the melted bacon until they begin to brown.
9. Once the cucumbers have browned, transfer them to a stove and simmer them in gravy. Remove any excess fat from the gravy.
10. Thicken the gravy with a cullis made from veal and bacon.
11. When the duck is cooked through, pour the thickened gravy with cucumbers over the duck.
12. Serve the dressed duck with cucumbers immediately.

## Cooking time
Approximately 2-3 hours for braising the duck.
