# Raifin Wine

## Description
Raifin Wine is a sweet and fruity wine made from raisins. It has a rich flavor and can be enjoyed as a dessert wine or used in cocktails.

## Ingredients:
- 5.4 kg raisins
- 2.7 kg white sugar
- Juice of 12 lemons
- Peels of 6 lemons
- 45.4 liters water

## Instructions:
1. Remove any stems from the raisins and rinse them thoroughly.
2. In a large pot, combine the raisins, sugar, lemon juice, lemon peels, and water.
3. Place the pot on the stove and bring the mixture to a boil over medium heat.
4. Once boiling, reduce the heat to low and let it simmer for 30 minutes.
5. Remove the pot from the heat and cover it tightly. Let it sit at room temperature for 3-4 days, stirring it twice a day.
6. After the fermentation period, strain the mixture through a fine-mesh sieve or cheesecloth to remove any solids.
7. Transfer the strained liquid into clean, sterilized bottles, leaving some headspace at the top to allow for expansion.
8. Seal the bottles tightly and store them in a cool place for at least 2 weeks to allow the flavors to develop.
9. After 2 weeks, the Raifin Wine will be ready to drink. Serve chilled.
