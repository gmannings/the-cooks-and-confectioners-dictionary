# Perfumed Cakes

## Description
Perfumed Cakes are small, fragrant pastries that were popular in the 18th century. They were often scented with aromatic ingredients such as Benjamin, Storax, Labdanum, Calamus Aromaticus, and Citron-peel. This recipe provides instructions on how to make a perfumed paste that can be used to flavor cakes or other baked goods.

## Ingredients:
- 2 ounces Benjamin (modern alternative: benzoin resin)
- 1 ounce Storax (modern alternative: liquid storax or benzoin resin)
- 0.5 dram Labdanum (modern alternative: labdanum essential oil)
- 0.5 dram Calamus Aromaticus (modern alternative: calamus essential oil)
- Citron-peel (amount not specified, use a small amount to taste)
- 6 cloves
- Rose-water
- Linen cloth

## Instructions:
1. In a new glazed pipkin, combine the Benjamin and Storax.
2. Add half a pint of rose-water to the pipkin.
3. Place the pipkin on the stove and heat it gently, allowing the mixture to simmer. The goal is to extract the fragrance from the Benjamin and Storax without evaporating all the moisture. Stir occasionally.
4. While the mixture is simmering, tie the Labdanum, cloves, and a small amount of citron-peel in a linen rag. This will prevent the ingredients from dispersing in the mixture.
5. After some time, when the moisture in the pipkin is almost evaporated, add more rose-water to the mixture.
6. Continue simmering the mixture for a little longer, allowing the flavors to infuse.
7. Remove the pipkin from the heat and strain the mixture through a linen cloth to remove any solids.
8. Allow the perfumed paste to cool completely.
