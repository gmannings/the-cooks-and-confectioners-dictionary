# Capon Pie

## Description
Capon Pie is a traditional dish made with a parboiled capon (a castrated rooster), which is then stuffed with a flavorful mixture of liver, truffles, herbs, and spices. The capon is placed in a pie crust along with layers of bacon and veal, and then baked until golden and delicious. The pie is served with a rich ragout of truffles, or alternatively, with a ragout of crayfish or oysters.

## Ingredients:
- 1 capon
- Large lardons (thick strips of bacon)
- Salt
- Pepper
- Spices (such as nutmeg, cloves, or allspice)
- Fresh herbs (such as thyme, rosemary, or sage)
- Chives
- Parsley
- Liver of the capon
- Truffles
- Veal slices
- Bacon slices
- Sweet butter
- Pie crust
- Powdered bacon (bacon ground into a powder)
- Veal gravy
- Ham
- Essence of ham
- Cullis of veal
- Crayfish or oysters (optional)

## Instructions:
1. Parboil the capon by boiling it in a large pot of water until partially cooked. Remove from the pot and let it cool.
2. Prepare the lardons by cutting thick strips of bacon.
3. Season the lardons with salt, pepper, spices, chopped fresh herbs, chives, and parsley.
4. Pound the liver of the capon in a mortar along with truffles, chives, parsley, salt, pepper, spices, and fresh herbs. Pound until well combined and smooth.
5. Stuff the body of the capon with the liver and truffle mixture.
6. Line the bottom of a pie dish with a sheet of parchment paper.
7. Roll out the pie crust and line the pie dish, making sure the crust is thick enough to hold the filling.
8. Spread a layer of powdered bacon on the bottom of the pie crust, and season it with salt, pepper, spices, and chopped savory herbs.
9. Place the stuffed capon on top of the powdered bacon layer.
10. Season the capon with the same seasonings used for the powdered bacon layer.
11. Layer slices of veal on top of the capon.
12. Place thin slices of bacon on top of the veal, and dot with small pieces of sweet butter.
13. Cover the pie with another layer of pie crust, sealing the edges well.
14. Preheat the oven to the appropriate temperature.
15. Place the pie in the preheated oven and bake for two to three hours, or until the crust is golden brown and the capon is cooked through.
16. While the pie is baking, prepare the ragout. Peel and wash truffles, then cut them into pieces.
17. Place the truffle pieces in a saucepan and add a little veal gravy. Stew over a gentle fire until the truffles are tender.
18. Once the truffles are cooked, add cullis of veal and ham essence to thicken the sauce.
19. When the pie is baked, remove the paper from the bottom, cut off the lid, and take out the bacon and veal.
20. Skim off any excess fat from the pie.
21. Pour the truffle ragout into the pie, making sure to cover the capon.
22. Serve the Capon Pie as a first course, accompanied by the truffle ragout. Alternatively, it can be served with a ragout of crayfish or oysters instead of truffles.
