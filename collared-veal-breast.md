# Collared Veal Breast

## Description
Collared veal breast is a traditional dish where a boneless veal breast is seasoned, rolled up, and cooked in the oven. The veal breast is filled with a mixture of herbs, spices, hard-boiled eggs, anchovies, and bacon. The result is a flavorful and tender meat dish that can be served hot or cold.

## Ingredients:
- 1 large veal breast, boneless
- 4-5 sage leaves, finely chopped
- 1 tablespoon winter savory, finely chopped
- 1 tablespoon sweet marjoram, finely chopped
- 1 tablespoon thyme leaves, finely chopped
- 1 tablespoon chives, finely chopped
- 1 teaspoon lemon zest
- Salt and pepper to taste
- 1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg
- 3-4 hard-boiled eggs, chopped
- 5 anchovies, boned and chopped
- 1/4 pound bacon, thinly sliced
- 2 tablespoons beef suet or marrow, shredded
- Kitchen twine

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F).

2. Lay the veal breast flat on a cutting board. Using a sharp knife, remove any excess fat and gristle from the veal breast.

3. In a bowl, combine the chopped sage, winter savory, sweet marjoram, thyme, chives, and lemon zest. Season the mixture with salt, pepper, and nutmeg.

4. Sprinkle the herb mixture evenly over the veal breast. Then, sprinkle the chopped hard-boiled eggs and chopped anchovies over the herbs.

5. Lay the bacon slices over the veal breast, covering the herbs, eggs, and anchovies.

6. In a separate bowl, mix together the shredded beef suet or marrow with the remaining herb mixture. Spread this mixture evenly over the bacon.

7. Starting from one end, tightly roll up the veal breast, making sure the filling is secure inside. Tie the rolled veal breast with kitchen twine at regular intervals to hold its shape.

8. Place the rolled veal breast in a roasting pan or baking dish. Cover the dish with foil.

9. Place the dish in the preheated oven and roast for about 2 hours, or until the veal is cooked through and tender. Remove the foil during the last 30 minutes of cooking to allow the bacon to crisp up.

10. Once cooked, remove the veal breast from the oven and let it rest for a few minutes. Remove the kitchen twine and slice the veal breast into thick slices.

11. Serve the collared veal breast hot or cold, as desired.
