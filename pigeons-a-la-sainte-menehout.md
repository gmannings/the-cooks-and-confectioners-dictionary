# Pigeons a la Sainte Menehout

## Description
Pigeons a la Sainte Menehout is a classic 18th-century dish made with truffled pigeons that are braised and then either fried or broiled. The pigeons are seasoned with a mixture of spices, herbs, and bacon, and then cooked in a pot with veal, onions, and carrots. The dish can be served hot with a crispy coating or cold without any additional cooking.

## Options and commentary
- Instead of pigeons, you can use chicken or Cornish hens as a modern alternative.
- If you prefer a lighter version, you can skip the frying or broiling step and serve the pigeons directly after braising.
- The ramolade sauce mentioned in the broiled version can be made by mixing oil, salt, pepper, anchovies, mustard, chopped chives, parsley, and lemon juice.

## Ingredients:
- 2 large pigeons (or chicken/Cornish hens)
- Truffles (optional)

For the ramolade sauce (optional):

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F).
2. If using truffles, stuff the pigeons with them.
3. Divide the pigeons into two halves.
4. Lard the pigeons by inserting large lardons of bacon into the meat.
5. Season the pigeons with salt, pepper, spices, chopped herbs, chives, and parsley.
6. In a pot or stew-pan, layer slices of bacon on the bottom.
7. Place slices of veal or beef on top of the bacon.
8. Add sliced onions and carrots.
9. Arrange the pigeon halves on top of the vegetables.
10. Repeat the seasoning on top of the pigeons.
11. Layer more slices of veal or beef on top of the seasoning.
12. Add another layer of bacon slices.
13. Cover the pot or stew-pan tightly.
14. Place the pot or stew-pan on the stove over medium heat.
15. Cook the pigeons "a la braise" by applying heat both over and under the pot.
16. After about half of the cooking time, add the milk and broth to moisten the pigeons.
17. Continue stewing the pigeons until they are cooked through and tender.
18. Remove the pot or stew-pan from the heat and let the pigeons cool in their own liquid.
19. Once cooled, remove the pigeons from the liquid and drain them.
20. Dip the pigeons in beaten eggs, ensuring they are fully coated.
21. Coat the pigeons with breadcrumbs, pressing them firmly onto the surface.
22. Heat hogs lard (or vegetable oil) in a frying pan.
23. Fry the pigeons until they are golden brown on all sides.
24. Remove the fried pigeons from the pan and place them on a clean napkin to absorb excess oil.
25. If broiling the pigeons, dip them in the fat from the stewing liquid and coat them with grated bread.
26. Place the pigeons on a preheated grill and broil them until they are cooked and browned.
27. If desired, prepare the ramolade sauce by mixing oil, salt, pepper, anchovies, mustard, chopped chives, parsley, and lemon juice.
28. Serve the hot pigeons with the ramolade sauce on the side.
29. Alternatively, serve the pigeons cold on plates or small dishes without frying or broiling.
