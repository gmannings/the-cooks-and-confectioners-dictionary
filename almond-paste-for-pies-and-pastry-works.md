# Almond Paste for Pies and Pastry Works

## Description
This recipe is for making almond paste that can be used as the bottom crust or garnish for pies and other pastry works. The almond paste is made by pounding and moistening almonds, then mixing them with clarified sugar. The mixture is then cooked until it loosens from the pan, rolled into large rolls, and allowed to rest before use.

## Ingredients:
- 200g almonds
- 200g sugar
- 1 egg white

## Instructions:
1. Pound the almonds until they are finely ground.
2. Moisten the ground almonds with a small amount of water to form a paste.
3. In a large copper pan, clarify the sugar by mixing it with the egg white and boiling until it becomes feathered (resembling a feather-like texture).
4. Add a larger quantity of the clarified sugar mixture to the almond paste and mix well with a spatula.
5. Place the pan over a fire and continuously stir the mixture until the paste loosens from the pan.
6. Cover a dish with fine sugar.
7. Spread the almond paste onto the sugar-covered dish.
8. Roll the almond paste into large rolls.
9. Allow the almond paste to rest for some time before using.
