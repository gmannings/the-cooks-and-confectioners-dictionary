# Pippin Pudding

## Description
Pippin Pudding is a traditional 18th-century dessert made with boiled and scraped apples, flavored with cream or floral water, and baked in a pastry crust. It is a sweet and fragrant pudding that can be served warm or cold.

## Options and commentary
- Instead of Pippins, you can use any tart and firm apple variety such as Granny Smith or Braeburn.
- Instead of cream, you can use milk or a non-dairy alternative like almond milk.
- Instead of Orange-Flower-Water or Rose-Water, you can use vanilla extract for a more modern flavor.
- You can serve the pudding with a dollop of whipped cream or a scoop of vanilla ice cream for added indulgence.

## Ingredients:
- 6 tart and firm apples (such as Granny Smith or Braeburn)
- 1 pint (473 ml) cream or milk
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- Sugar, to taste
- 1 sheet of ready-made pastry crust
- Powdered sugar, for dusting

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F).
2. Peel, core, and quarter the apples.
3. In a large pot, bring water to a boil and add the apple quarters. Boil the apples until they are tender, about 10-15 minutes.
4. Drain the boiled apples and let them cool slightly.
5. Using a fork or a potato masher, scrape the cooked apples to create a chunky applesauce-like consistency. Remove any remaining cores or seeds.
6. In a separate bowl, combine the cream (or milk), vanilla extract, and sugar. Adjust the amount of sugar to your taste preference.
7. Roll out the sheet of pastry crust and line a baking dish with it.
8. Spread the scraped apples evenly over the pastry crust in the baking dish.
9. Pour the cream mixture over the apples, ensuring it is evenly distributed.
10. Place the baking dish in the preheated oven and bake for approximately 30-35 minutes, or until the pastry is golden brown and the pudding is set.
11. Remove the pudding from the oven and let it cool slightly.
12. Sprinkle powdered sugar over the top of the pudding.
13. Serve the Pippin Pudding warm or cold, as desired.

## Cooking time
Approximately 1 hour (including boiling the apples and baking the pudding).
