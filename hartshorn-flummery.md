# Hartshorn Flummery

## Description
Hartshorn Flummery is a creamy and sweet dessert made with hartshorn (deer antler shavings), cream, white wine, and orange flower water. It has a smooth and delicate texture, and is traditionally served chilled with blanched almond slices on top. It can be enjoyed on its own or paired with wine or cream.

## Ingredients:
- 50g hartshorn shavings
- 1.5 liters water
- 250ml thick cream
- 125ml white wine
- 2 tablespoons orange flower water
- Sugar, to taste
- Blanched almond slices, for garnish

## Instructions:
1. In a large pot, bring the water to a boil. Add the hartshorn shavings and simmer for about 2 hours, or until the liquid has reduced to 500ml (1 pint). 
2. Strain the mixture through a sieve into a basin and set it aside to cool.
3. Once cooled, place the basin over low heat and gently melt the mixture.
4. In a separate pot, heat the thick cream until it is scalded. Allow it to cool.
5. Add the scalded cream, white wine, and orange flower water to the melted hartshorn mixture. 
6. Sweeten the mixture with sugar to taste. 
7. Using an electric mixer or a whisk, beat the mixture for about 1.5 hours, or until it is well mixed and has a smooth consistency.
8. Dip the cups or molds in water before pouring in the flummery mixture to ensure easy removal later.
9. Pour the flummery mixture into cups or molds and refrigerate for at least 2 days before serving.
10. To serve, turn the flummery out of the cups or molds onto serving plates.
11. Garnish the tops of the flummery with blanched almond slices.
12. Enjoy the Hartshorn Flummery chilled, either on its own or with wine or cream.
