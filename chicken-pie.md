## Ingredients:
- 1 whole chicken, cut into pieces
- Water and milk, for poaching the chicken
- Puff pastry, enough to line the bottom and cover the pie dish
- Butter, for greasing the dish and layering
- Assorted sweetmeats (dried fruits and nuts), chopped
- Salt, to taste
- Nutmeg, to taste
- Cloves, to taste
- Mace, to taste
- Sugar, a small amount
- Additional butter, for layering

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F).
2. In a large pot, combine water and milk in equal parts. Bring to a simmer.
3. Add the chicken pieces to the pot and poach them until cooked through. This will take about 20-30 minutes, depending on the size of the chicken pieces. Remove the chicken from the pot and let it cool slightly.
4. Remove the skin from the chicken pieces and discard.
5. Grease a pie dish with butter and line the bottom with puff pastry. Make sure to leave enough pastry to cover the top of the pie.
6. Layer the bottom of the pie dish with butter, followed by a layer of assorted sweetmeats.
7. Season the chicken pieces with salt, nutmeg, cloves, mace, and a little sugar. Roll up the seasoning in a piece of butter and place it inside the chicken cavity.
8. Arrange the seasoned chicken pieces in the pie dish, with their heads on.
9. Layer butter over the chicken pieces, followed by another layer of sweetmeats.
10. Cover the pie with the remaining puff pastry, sealing the edges well.
11. Make a few small slits on the top of the pastry to allow steam to escape during baking.
12. Bake the pie in the preheated oven for about 45-60 minutes, or until the pastry is golden brown and the filling is hot and bubbly.
13. Remove from the oven and let the pie cool slightly before serving.
