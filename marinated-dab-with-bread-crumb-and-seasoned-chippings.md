# Marinated Dab with Bread Crumb and Seasoned Chippings

## Description
This dish features marinated dab, a type of flatfish, that is breaded with breadcrumbs and seasoned chippings. It is then baked to perfection and garnished with little pies.

## Ingredients:
- 1 dab (flatfish)
- Marinade ingredients (refer to Marinade recipe in Letter M)
- Bread crumbs
- Seasoned chippings (a mixture of herbs, spices, and seasonings of your choice)
- Little pies (for garnish)

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to the recommended temperature for baking fish.

2. Cut the dab through the back to create a pocket for the marinade to penetrate. This will help infuse the flavors into the fish.

3. Prepare the marinade as directed in the Marinade recipe in Letter M. Make sure to follow the instructions carefully to achieve the desired flavors.

4. Place the dab in a container or dish and pour the marinade over it. Ensure that the fish is fully coated in the marinade. Allow it to marinate for the recommended time specified in the marinade recipe.

5. While the dab is marinating, prepare the seasoned chippings. Combine your choice of herbs, spices, and seasonings in a bowl and mix well.

6. Preheat the oven to the recommended temperature for baking.

7. Remove the dab from the marinade and pat it dry with paper towels. This will help the breadcrumbs adhere better to the fish.

8. Coat the dab with bread crumbs, ensuring that it is evenly coated on all sides.

9. Sprinkle the seasoned chippings over the breaded dab, pressing them gently into the breadcrumbs to help them stick.

10. Place the breaded and seasoned dab on a baking sheet or dish.

11. Bake the dab in the preheated oven for the recommended cooking time for fish of this size and thickness. The fish should be cooked through and the breadcrumbs should be golden brown and crispy.

12. While the dab is baking, prepare the little pies for garnish. You can use pre-made mini pies or make your own using your favorite pie dough recipe.

13. Once the dab is cooked, remove it from the oven and allow it to cool slightly.

14. Garnish the baked dab with the little pies, arranging them around the fish for an attractive presentation.

15. Serve the marinated dab with bread crumbs and seasoned chippings hot as a side dish or main course.

## Cooking time
The cooking time will vary depending on the size and thickness of the dab. Follow the recommended cooking time for fish of this size and thickness, usually around 15-20 minutes per inch of thickness at the recommended baking temperature.
