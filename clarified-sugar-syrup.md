# Clarified Sugar Syrup

## Description
This recipe is for making clarified sugar syrup, which can be used in various desserts and drinks. The syrup is made by dissolving sugar in water and then clarifying it to remove impurities. This method produces a syrup that is not as clear or white as the traditional method, but it is still suitable for most purposes.

## Ingredients:
- 1 cup sugar
- 1 cup water
- 1 egg white

## Instructions:
1. In a saucepan, combine the sugar and water.
2. Heat the mixture over medium heat, stirring constantly, until the sugar is completely dissolved.
3. In a separate bowl, whisk the egg white until frothy.
4. Slowly pour the frothy egg white into the saucepan with the sugar mixture, while continuing to stir.
5. Increase the heat to high and bring the mixture to a boil. Be careful as it may foam up.
6. Once the mixture starts to rise and is about to overflow, quickly pour in a small amount of cold water to stop it from overflowing.
7. Reduce the heat to medium-low and let the mixture simmer for about 15 minutes. This will allow the sugar to sink and impurities to rise to the top.
8. Use a skimmer or a spoon to gently remove the black scum that has formed on the top of the syrup. Discard the scum.
9. The syrup is now clarified and ready to use. It may not be as clear or white as the traditional method, but it will still work well in most recipes.
