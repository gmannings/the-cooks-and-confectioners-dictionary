# Stewed Pig with Sippets

## Description
This recipe is a modernized version of an 18th-century dish called "Stewed Pig with Sippets." It features a tender pork loin stewed in a flavorful broth and served over toasted bread slices called sippets. The dish is then topped with a rich sauce made from the cooking liquid and other ingredients. It is a hearty and comforting dish that can be enjoyed as a main course.

## Options and commentary
- You can use boneless pork loin or pork tenderloin for this recipe.
- Sippets are thin slices of toasted bread that can be used as a base for the stewed pig. You can use baguette slices or any other crusty bread for this purpose.
- The sauce can be thickened with a roux or cornstarch slurry if desired.
- Feel free to add additional herbs and spices to the stewing liquid for extra flavor.

## Ingredients:
- 1 kg pork loin
- 1 large onion, chopped
- 2 carrots, peeled and sliced
- 2 celery stalks, sliced
- 2 cloves of garlic, minced
- 1 bay leaf
- 1 tsp dried thyme
- 1 tsp salt
- 1/2 tsp black pepper
- 500 ml chicken or vegetable broth
- 4 slices of crusty bread (baguette or similar)
- 2 tbsp butter
- 2 tbsp all-purpose flour
- Chopped parsley, for garnish

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 180°C.
2. In a large oven-safe pot or Dutch oven, heat some oil over medium-high heat. Add the pork loin and brown it on all sides until nicely seared. Remove the pork from the pot and set it aside.
3. In the same pot, add the chopped onion, carrots, celery, and minced garlic. Sauté for about 5 minutes until the vegetables start to soften.
4. Add the bay leaf, dried thyme, salt, and black pepper to the pot. Stir well to combine.
5. Place the browned pork loin back into the pot, along with any juices that may have accumulated. Pour in the chicken or vegetable broth, making sure the pork is partially submerged.
6. Cover the pot with a lid and transfer it to the preheated oven. Allow the pork to stew for about 2 hours, or until it is tender and easily pulls apart with a fork.
7. While the pork is stewing, prepare the sippets. Toast the bread slices until golden brown and set them aside.
8. Once the pork is cooked, carefully remove it from the pot and place it on a cutting board. Let it rest for a few minutes before slicing.
9. In a separate saucepan, melt the butter over medium heat. Add the flour and cook, stirring constantly, for about 2 minutes to make a roux.
10. Slowly pour the cooking liquid from the pot into the saucepan with the roux, whisking constantly to prevent lumps. Continue cooking and stirring until the sauce thickens.
11. To serve, place the toasted bread slices (sippets) in a serving dish. Arrange the sliced pork loin on top of the sippets. Pour the thickened sauce over the pork.
12. Garnish with chopped parsley and serve hot.
