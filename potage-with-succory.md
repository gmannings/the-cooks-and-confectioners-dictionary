# Potage with Succory

## Description
Potage with Succory is a hearty soup made with a variety of fowl and succory (also known as chicory). The fowl is boiled in a flavorful broth with spices and herbs, and then the succory is added to the broth. The potage is then dressed and garnished with succory, and served with natural broth, mutton gravy, and mushrooms.

## Ingredients:
- 1 young turkey, capon, pullet, or other fowl
- 1 liter of good broth (chicken or vegetable)
- Salt to taste
- Spices (such as pepper, nutmeg, or cloves) to taste
- 1 faggot of fresh herbs (such as thyme, parsley, and bay leaves)
- 500 grams of succory (chicory)
- Water for scalding the succory
- Mutton gravy
- Mushrooms

## Instructions:
1. In a large pot, bring the fowl, good broth, salt, spices, and faggot of fresh herbs to a boil. Reduce the heat and simmer until the fowl is cooked through and tender. This will take approximately 1-2 hours, depending on the size of the fowl.
2. While the fowl is cooking, prepare the succory. Start by scalding the succory in boiling water for a few minutes to remove any bitterness. Drain the succory and set aside.
3. Once the fowl is cooked, remove it from the pot and set it aside to cool slightly. Strain the broth to remove any solids and return it to the pot.
4. Add the scalded succory to the broth and bring it to a boil. Reduce the heat and simmer for about 10-15 minutes, or until the succory is tender.
5. While the succory is cooking, debone the fowl and shred the meat into bite-sized pieces.
6. Once the succory is tender, return the shredded fowl meat to the pot and stir to combine. Cook for an additional 5 minutes to heat through.
7. Taste the potage and adjust the seasoning if needed.
8. To serve, ladle the potage into bowls and garnish with fresh succory leaves. Serve with natural broth, mutton gravy, and saut√©ed mushrooms on the side.
