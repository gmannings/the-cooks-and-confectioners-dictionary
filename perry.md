# Perry

## Description
Perry is a type of alcoholic beverage made from fermented pears. It is similar to cider but made specifically from pears instead of apples. This recipe provides instructions for making perry using a traditional 18th-century method.

## Options and commentary
- Use ripe pears that have a very vinous juice for the best flavor.
- If using pears with a sweet taste, consider mixing in some crabapples to balance the sweetness.
- Some recommended pear varieties for making perry include red and green squash pear, John pear, Lullarm pear, white and red horse pears, or Turgovian pear.

## Ingredients:
- Ripe pears
- Crabapples (optional, if using sweet pears)

## Instructions:
1. Select ripe pears that have a very vinous juice. Avoid using overly ripe pears as their pulp may not easily release its juice.
2. If using sweet pears, consider mixing in some crabapples to balance the sweetness.
3. Grind the pears and crabapples to extract their juice. Use a fruit press or any suitable method to extract the juice.
4. Collect the juice in a clean container.
5. Allow the juice to ferment in a cool, dark place for several weeks. The fermentation process will convert the sugars in the juice into alcohol.
6. After fermentation, strain the perry to remove any sediment or solids.
7. Bottle the perry and store it in a cool place for further aging. The flavors will continue to develop over time.

## Cooking time
- Grinding the pears and crabapples: approximately 30 minutes
- Fermentation: several weeks
- Aging: several months to a year (optional)
