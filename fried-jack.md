# Fried Jack

## Description
Fried Jack is a dish made with a type of fish called Jack. The fish is cleaned, floured, and fried until it is brown and crispy. It is then served with fried sage and parsley, and topped with a butter sauce flavored with anchovy. The dish is garnished with strawberry leaves and parsley.

## Ingredients:
- 1 Jack fish (or any firm white fish fillets)
- Flour, for coating
- Butter, for frying
- Fresh sage leaves
- Fresh parsley
- 1 anchovy fillet
- Hot water
- Strawberry leaves, for garnish

## Instructions:
1. Clean the Jack fish by scraping off the scales, gutting it, and removing any innards. Rinse the fish under cold water and pat it dry with paper towels.
2. Coat the fish with flour, shaking off any excess.
3. Heat a generous amount of butter in a frying pan over medium heat.
4. Fry the fish in the butter until it is brown and crispy on both sides. This will take about 4-5 minutes per side, depending on the thickness of the fish fillets. Remove the fish from the pan and set it aside on a dish.
5. Pour off the butter used for frying the fish.
6. In the same pan, add more butter and fry the sage leaves and parsley until they are crispy. Remove them from the pan and set them aside.
7. In a small saucepan, melt some butter and add the anchovy fillet. Stir until the anchovy is dissolved.
8. Add three or four spoonfuls of hot water to the butter and anchovy mixture. Stir well to combine.
9. Pour the butter sauce over the fried fish.
10. Garnish the dish with strawberry leaves and parsley.
11. Serve the Fried Jack immediately.
