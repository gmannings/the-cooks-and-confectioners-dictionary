# Rosewater Sugar Cookies

## Description
These rosewater sugar cookies are a modern twist on a classic 18th-century recipe. The addition of rosewater gives these cookies a delicate floral flavor, while the sugar adds a touch of sweetness. These cookies are perfect for afternoon tea or as a sweet treat any time of the day.

## Ingredients:
- 12 eggs
- 5-6 tablespoons of rosewater
- 2 pounds of granulated sugar
- Enough all-purpose flour to make a rollable dough

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 350°F (180°C).
2. In a large mixing bowl, beat the eggs until well combined.
3. Add the rosewater to the beaten eggs and mix well.
4. Gradually add the sugar to the egg mixture, stirring until fully incorporated.
5. Slowly add the flour to the mixture, mixing until a dough forms. The dough should be soft and pliable, but not sticky. Add more flour if needed.
6. On a lightly floured surface, roll out the dough to a thickness of about 1/4 inch (0.6 cm).
7. Use cookie cutters to cut out cookies in any desired shape.
8. Place the cookies on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper.
9. Bake in the preheated oven for 10-12 minutes, or until the edges of the cookies are lightly golden.
10. Remove from the oven and let the cookies cool on the baking sheet for a few minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely.
11. Once cooled, store the cookies in an airtight container.
