## Description
This recipe is for a classic French dish called "Drels Pikes a la Sainte Robert." It involves preparing and cooking pike fish in a flavorful marinade, frying them, and serving them with a rich Sauce Robert. The dish is typically served hot and is a delicious and elegant option for a special meal.

## Options and commentary
- Instead of pike fish, you can use any firm white fish such as cod or halibut.
- If you don't have access to fish broth, you can use vegetable or chicken broth as a substitute.
- The Sauce Robert can be thickened with a roux or cornstarch slurry if you prefer a thicker consistency.

## Ingredients:
- 2 pike fish fillets (or any firm white fish fillets)
- Vinegar
- Salt
- Pepper
- Sweet basil
- Bay leaves
- Slices of onions
- Slices of lemon
- Butter
- Fish broth
- Mustard
- Vinegar

## Instructions:
1. Gut, scale, and fillet the pike fish. If using other fish, make sure they are cleaned and filleted.
2. Divide each fillet into pieces and score them lightly.
3. In a bowl, prepare the marinade by combining vinegar, salt, pepper, sweet basil, bay leaves, slices of onions, and slices of lemon.
4. Place the fish pieces in the marinade and let them marinate for about an hour.
5. Remove the fish from the marinade and pat them dry with a kitchen towel.
6. Lightly coat the fish pieces with flour.
7. In a frying pan, melt a generous amount of butter over medium heat.
8. Fry the fish pieces in the butter until they are golden brown and cooked through. Remove them from the pan and set aside.
9. In a saucepan, melt a good amount of butter over medium heat.
10. Add the sliced onions to the saucepan and fry them until they are browned.
11. Moisten the onions with fish broth and let them stew for some time.
12. Once the onions are stewed enough, skim off any fat from the surface of the sauce.
13. Thicken the sauce by adding a cullis (a type of sauce thickener made from meat or vegetable stock).
14. Place the fried fish pieces into the sauce and let them simmer for a few minutes.
15. Dish out the fish pieces onto a serving platter and keep them warm.
