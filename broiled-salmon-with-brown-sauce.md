# Broiled Salmon with Brown Sauce

## Description
This recipe involves broiling slices of salmon and serving them with a flavorful brown sauce. The salmon is first rubbed with melted butter and then cooked on a grill. The brown sauce is made by melting butter, adding flour to create a roux, and then incorporating white wine, fish broth, and various seasonings. The broiled salmon is then simmered in the sauce until it reaches the desired consistency. The dish is finished by thickening the sauce with beaten egg yolks and verjuice before pouring it over the salmon.
