# Smelts au Court Bouillon

## Description
Smelts au Court Bouillon is a classic 18th-century dish consisting of smelts (small fish) stewed in a flavorful broth made with white wine, lemon, and spices. The smelts are served on a napkin with parsley and slices of lemon, and can be enjoyed with vinegar and white pepper or a tangy sauce called Rémoulade.

## Options and commentary
- Smelts: If smelts are not available, you can substitute them with other small fish like sardines or anchovies.
- White wine: Use a dry white wine such as Sauvignon Blanc or Pinot Grigio.
- Vinegar: You can use white wine vinegar or apple cider vinegar for a tangy flavor.
- Rémoulade: Rémoulade is a classic French sauce made with mayonnaise, mustard, capers, and herbs. You can make your own or use a store-bought version.

## Ingredients:
- 500g smelts
- 250ml dry white wine
- Salt, to taste
- Pepper, to taste
- 2 slices of lemon
- 2 bay leaves
- Fresh parsley, for garnish
- Slices of lemon, for garnish
- Vinegar, for serving
- White pepper, for serving
- Rémoulade, for serving (optional)

## Instructions:
1. Clean the smelts by removing the heads, tails, and guts. Rinse them under cold water and pat dry with paper towels.
2. In a stew-pan, combine the white wine, salt, pepper, slices of lemon, and bay leaves. Bring the mixture to a simmer over medium heat.
3. Add the cleaned smelts to the simmering broth. Make sure they are fully submerged in the liquid.
4. Cover the stew-pan and let the smelts stew for about 10-15 minutes, or until they are cooked through and tender.
5. While the smelts are cooking, prepare a serving platter or a napkin by arranging fresh parsley and slices of lemon on it.
6. Once the smelts are cooked, carefully remove them from the broth using a slotted spoon and arrange them on the prepared platter or napkin.
7. Serve the smelts with vinegar and white pepper on the side, allowing each person to season their smelts according to their taste. Alternatively, serve with Rémoulade for a tangy and creamy dipping sauce.
