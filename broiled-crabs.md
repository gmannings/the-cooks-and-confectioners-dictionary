# Broiled Crabs

## Description
Broiled crabs are a delicious seafood dish that can be enjoyed as an appetizer or main course. The crabs are boiled in salted water, marinated in a mixture of oil and vinegar, and then grilled on a gridiron. They are basted with rosemary branches while they cook, adding a fragrant and flavorful touch. The crabs are served with a choice of either beaten butter and vinegar or oil and vinegar, along with the rosemary branches used for basting.

## Ingredients:
- 4 crabs
- Water
- Salt
- 2 tablespoons oil
- 2 tablespoons vinegar
- Rosemary branches
- Beaten butter (optional)
- Additional vinegar or oil (optional)

## Instructions:
1. Fill a large pot with water and add salt. Bring the water to a boil.
2. Place the crabs in the boiling water and cook for about 10 minutes, or until they turn bright red.
3. Remove the crabs from the pot and let them cool slightly.
4. In a bowl, whisk together the oil and vinegar until well combined.
5. Place the crabs in the oil and vinegar mixture, ensuring they are fully coated. Let them marinate for at least 30 minutes.
6. Preheat the grill to medium heat.
7. Remove the crabs from the marinade and place them on a preheated gridiron or grill grate.
8. Grill the crabs for about 5 minutes on each side, or until they are heated through and have grill marks.
9. While the crabs are grilling, baste them with the rosemary branches, using them as a brush to apply the marinade.
10. Once the crabs are cooked, remove them from the grill and transfer them to a serving platter.
11. Serve the broiled crabs with beaten butter and vinegar or oil and vinegar on the side. Optionally, garnish with additional rosemary branches.
