# Roasted Soles

## Description
Roasted Soles is a classic dish made with fresh sole fish that is seasoned with herbs and spices, larded with eel fat, and roasted to perfection. The fish is then served with a flavorful sauce made from the pan drippings and a tangy lemon garnish.

## Ingredients:
- 4 sole fish fillets
- 1 tablespoon minced winter savory
- 1 tablespoon minced thyme
- 1 tablespoon minced sweet marjoram
- 1 sprig rosemary, finely chopped
- Salt to taste
- Grated nutmeg to taste
- 100 grams fresh eel fat, thinly sliced
- 250 ml white wine
- 4 anchovy fillets, dissolved in the white wine
- 50 grams butter
- Slices of lemon for garnish

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 180Â°C.
2. Clean the sole fish fillets by removing the skin and patting them dry with paper towels.
3. In a small bowl, mix together the minced winter savory, thyme, sweet marjoram, rosemary, salt, and grated nutmeg.
4. Season the sole fish fillets with the herb and spice mixture, making sure to coat both sides.
5. Lard each sole fish fillet with the thinly sliced eel fat, inserting the fat into the flesh of the fish.
6. Place the seasoned and larded sole fish fillets in a shallow dish and pour the white wine with dissolved anchovies over them. Let them marinate for 1 hour.
7. After marinating, remove the sole fish fillets from the dish and place them on a small roasting spit.
8. Place the dish with the marinade under the roasting spit to catch the drippings.
9. Roast the sole fish fillets in the preheated oven for about 15-20 minutes, or until they are cooked through and golden brown.
10. While the sole fish is roasting, melt the butter in a saucepan and set aside.
11. Once the sole fish is cooked, remove them from the oven and transfer them to a serving dish.
12. Pour the pan drippings from the dish into the saucepan with the melted butter.
13. Bring the sauce to a boil, stirring to combine the drippings and butter.
14. Once the sauce has boiled, remove it from the heat and pour it over the roasted sole fish fillets.
15. Garnish the dish with slices of lemon.
16. Serve the roasted soles immediately.
