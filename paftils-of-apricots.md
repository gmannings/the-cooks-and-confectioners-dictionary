# Paftils of Apricots

## Description
Paftils of Apricots are a sweet and fruity confection made with apricots and gum arabic. They have a soft and chewy texture and a delicious apricot flavor.

## Options and commentary
- You can use fresh or dried apricots for this recipe. If using dried apricots, soak them in water for a few hours before using.
- Gum arabic can be found in specialty stores or online. If you can't find it, you can substitute it with gelatin.
- The original recipe calls for syrup of apricots, which is a sweet syrup made from apricots. If you can't find it, you can substitute it with apricot jam or preserves.

## Ingredients:
- 200g dried apricots
- 1 tablespoon gum arabic (or gelatin)
- 1/4 cup water
- 1/4 cup apricot syrup (or apricot jam/preserves)
- 1 cup sugar

## Instructions:
1. In a small bowl, soak the gum arabic in water for about 10 minutes to soften it.
2. In a saucepan, combine the dried apricots and enough water to cover them. Bring to a boil and simmer for about 10 minutes until the apricots are soft.
3. Drain the apricots and transfer them to a blender or food processor. Blend until smooth.
4. In a mortar, combine the softened gum arabic and apricot syrup. Grind them together using a pestle until well combined.
5. Gradually add the sugar to the gum arabic mixture, mixing well after each addition. Continue until all the sugar is incorporated and the mixture is smooth.
6. Add the blended apricots to the gum arabic mixture and mix well until everything is evenly combined.
7. Line a baking dish or tray with parchment paper.
8. Pour the apricot mixture into the prepared dish and spread it out evenly.
9. Let the mixture set at room temperature for about 2 hours, or until it becomes firm and can be cut into squares or rectangles.
10. Once set, cut the mixture into desired shapes and sizes.
11. Store the paftils in an airtight container at room temperature.
