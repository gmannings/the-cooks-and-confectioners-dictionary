# Spiced Cream Pudding

## Description
This recipe is for a spiced cream pudding, made with a combination of spices, cream (or milk), bread, eggs, and sugar. It is a rich and creamy dessert with a hint of warm spices.

## Options and commentary
- You can use either cream or new milk for this recipe, depending on your preference.
- If you don't have access to marrow, you can omit it or substitute it with a thin layer of butter.
- The recipe suggests using a penny white loaf, which is a type of white bread. You can use any soft white bread for this purpose.
- Rosewater adds a delicate floral flavor to the pudding. If you don't have rosewater, you can substitute it with vanilla extract.
- The pudding can be served warm or chilled, depending on your preference.

## Ingredients:
- 1/4 ounce of mace
- 1 piece of cinnamon
- 1/2 nutmeg, sliced
- 2 quarts of cream or new milk
- 1 penny white loaf, sliced thin
- Marrow or butter, for layering
- 12 egg yolks
- Rosewater, to taste
- Sugar, to taste

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to a moderate temperature (around 180°C or 350°F).
2. In a saucepan, combine the mace, cinnamon, nutmeg, and cream (or milk). Heat the mixture over low heat until it is hot but not boiling. Allow the spices to infuse into the cream for about 10 minutes. Remove the spices from the cream and discard them.
3. While the cream is infusing, line the bottom of a baking dish with the sliced bread, creating a thin layer.
4. Spread a layer of marrow (or butter) over the bread slices.
5. In a separate bowl, beat the egg yolks with rosewater and sugar until well combined and slightly thickened.
6. Gradually pour the sweetened egg mixture into the infused cream (or milk), stirring constantly to prevent curdling.
7. Pour the cream and egg mixture over the bread and marrow (or butter) in the baking dish.
8. Place the baking dish in the preheated oven and bake for approximately 45-60 minutes, or until the pudding is set and golden on top.
9. Once baked, remove the pudding from the oven and let it cool slightly.
10. Sprinkle a generous amount of sugar over the top of the pudding.
11. Serve the spiced cream pudding warm or chilled, according to your preference.
