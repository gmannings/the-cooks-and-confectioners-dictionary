# Stewed Ducks with Claret

## Description
This recipe is for stewed ducks cooked in a rich sauce made with claret wine and strong broth. The ducks are first half roasted and then simmered in the sauce until tender. The dish is garnished with crispy fried bacon.

## Ingredients:
- 2 ducks
- 500 ml claret wine
- 500 ml strong broth (such as chicken or beef broth)
- 2 onions, quartered
- 1 bunch of fresh herbs (such as thyme, rosemary, and parsley)
- 1/2 teaspoon black pepper
- 4 slices of bacon, fried until crispy

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F).
2. Place the ducks on a roasting pan and roast them in the preheated oven for about 30 minutes, until they are half cooked and the skin is golden brown.
3. Remove the ducks from the oven and transfer them to a stew-pan.
4. Add the claret wine, strong broth, quartered onions, fresh herbs, and black pepper to the stew-pan with the ducks.
5. Cover the stew-pan with a lid and place it on the stove over medium heat.
6. Bring the liquid to a simmer and then reduce the heat to low.
7. Let the ducks simmer in the sauce for about 1 to 1 1/2 hours, or until they are tender and fully cooked. Occasionally skim off any impurities that rise to the surface.
8. Once the ducks are cooked, remove them from the sauce and transfer them to a serving platter.
9. Strain the sauce through a fine mesh sieve to remove the onions and herbs. Discard the solids.
10. Pour the strained sauce back into the stew-pan and bring it to a simmer over medium heat.
11. Let the sauce simmer for a few minutes to reduce and thicken slightly.
12. Meanwhile, fry the bacon slices in a separate pan until crispy. Remove them from the pan and drain on paper towels.
13. To serve, pour the reduced sauce over the roasted ducks and garnish with the crispy fried bacon slices.
