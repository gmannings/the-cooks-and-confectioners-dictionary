# Water Fritters

## Description
Water fritters are a sweet and crispy dessert made from a simple dough that is fried until golden brown. They are then sprinkled with sugar and flavored with orange flower water. 

## Options and commentary
- You can add a pinch of cinnamon or nutmeg to the dough for extra flavor.
- Instead of orange flower water, you can use vanilla extract or lemon zest for a different flavor profile.
- Serve the fritters with a side of whipped cream or a scoop of ice cream for a decadent treat.

## Ingredients:
- Water
- Salt
- Candied lemon peel
- Green lemon peel
- Butter
- Flour
- Eggs
- Hogs-lard (or vegetable oil)
- Sugar
- Orange flower water (or vanilla extract or lemon zest)

## Instructions:
1. In a stew-pan, combine water and a little salt.
2. Add the minced candied and green lemon peel, and a walnut-sized piece of butter.
3. Place the stew-pan over medium heat and bring the mixture to a boil.
4. Once boiling, add two large handfuls of flour to the pan and stir well until the mixture loosens from the pan.
5. Remove the pan from the heat and add the yolks of two eggs. Mix well.
6. Continue adding two eggs at a time, mixing well after each addition, until a total of twelve eggs have been added.
7. Dust a clean surface with flour and transfer the dough onto it.
8. Shape the dough into a ball and let it rest for a few minutes.
9. Roll out the dough into a thin sheet and cut it into small round pieces. Make sure they do not stick to each other.
10. Heat hogs-lard (or vegetable oil) in a frying pan over medium heat.
11. Fry the fritters in batches until they turn golden brown on both sides.
12. Remove the fritters from the pan and place them on a paper towel-lined plate to drain excess oil.
13. Sprinkle the fritters with sugar while they are still warm.
14. Optional: Sprinkle orange flower water (or vanilla extract or lemon zest) over the fritters for added flavor.
