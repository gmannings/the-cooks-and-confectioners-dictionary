# Baked Mullets

## Description
Baked Mullets is a dish made with mullet fish that is stuffed with a flavorful filling and baked in a pie crust. The fish is first larded with salted eel, then seasoned and stuffed with a pudding made from grated bread, minced fresh eel, sweet herbs, salt, nutmeg, minced hard-boiled egg yolks, and minced anchovies. The fish can be kept whole or cut into pieces. The pieces of mullet are seasoned with pepper, ginger, and nutmeg, then placed in a pie crust. Balls of the filling mixture are placed on top of the fish, along with prawns or cockles, capers, minced egg yolks, large mace, butter, and barberries. The pie is then closed and decorated with pastry garnishes, such as lozenges or cuts of pastry, and baked until golden. It is served with a garnish of sliced lemon.

## Options and commentary
- Instead of mullet, you can use any other firm white fish, such as sea bass or snapper.
- If you don't have access to salted eel, you can use bacon or pancetta as a substitute.
- The sweet herbs can include parsley, thyme, and marjoram.
- If you don't have barberries, you can use cranberries or currants.
- The pie crust can be homemade or store-bought.

## Ingredients:
- 1 whole mullet or 4 pieces of mullet (or any other firm white fish)
- 100g salted eel (or bacon/pancetta)
- 100g grated bread
- 100g minced fresh eel (or any other white fish)
- 2 tablespoons minced sweet herbs (such as parsley, thyme, and marjoram)
- Salt and pepper to taste
- 1/2 teaspoon nutmeg
- 2 hard-boiled egg yolks, minced
- 2 anchovies, minced
- 1/2 teaspoon ginger
- 100g prawns or cockles
- 1 tablespoon capers
- 1/2 teaspoon large mace
- 50g butter
- 50g barberries (or cranberries/currants)
- 1 pie crust
- Slices of lemon for garnish

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F).
2. Scale the mullets and remove the innards. Wash and dry the fish thoroughly.
3. If using a whole mullet, lard it by inserting strips of salted eel into the flesh. If using pieces of mullet, skip this step.
4. In a bowl, combine the grated bread, minced fresh eel, minced sweet herbs, salt, pepper, nutmeg, minced hard-boiled egg yolks, and minced anchovies. Mix well to form a pudding-like mixture.
5. If using a whole mullet, stuff the mixture into the belly cavity of the fish. If using pieces of mullet, season them with salt, pepper, ginger, and nutmeg.
6. Place the mullet (whole or pieces) in the pie crust.
7. Form small balls from the remaining filling mixture and place them on top of the fish in the pie crust.
8. Add the prawns or cockles, capers, minced egg yolks, large mace, butter, and barberries to the pie.
9. Close the pie by placing another layer of pie crust on top and sealing the edges.
10. Decorate the top of the pie with pastry garnishes, such as lozenges or cuts of pastry.
11. Bake the pie in the preheated oven for approximately 45 minutes, or until the crust is golden and the fish is cooked through.
12. Once baked, remove the pie from the oven and allow it to cool slightly.
13. Garnish the pie with slices of lemon before serving.
