# Pheasant Pie

## Description
A rich and flavorful pie filled with minced pheasant, pullet, veal, mushrooms, sweetbreads, gammon, bacon, chives, and parsley. Seasoned with salt, spices, and herbs, and baked in a pastry crust. Served hot with a mushroom sauce.

## Options and commentary
- You can use chicken instead of pheasant and chicken breast instead of pullet.
- If veal is not available, you can use pork or beef.
- You can use any type of mushrooms you prefer.
- For the gammon, you can use cooked ham.
- If you don't have sweetbreads, you can omit them or use chicken liver instead.
- Chives and parsley can be substituted with other fresh herbs like thyme or rosemary.
- You can use store-bought pastry crust or make your own.
- The mushroom sauce can be made by simmering mushrooms in broth or cream and thickening with flour or cornstarch.

## Ingredients:
- 1 pheasant, deboned and minced
- 1 fat pullet or chicken breast, minced
- 200g tender veal or pork, minced
- 200g mushrooms, finely chopped
- 100g veal sweetbreads or chicken liver, finely chopped
- 100g cooked gammon or ham, finely chopped
- 100g raw bacon, finely chopped
- 2 tablespoons chives, finely chopped
- 2 tablespoons parsley, finely chopped
- Salt to taste
- Spice blend (such as pepper, nutmeg, and cloves) to taste
- Fresh herbs (such as thyme or rosemary) to taste
- Pastry crust (store-bought or homemade)
- Mushroom sauce (store-bought or homemade)

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F).
2. In a large bowl, combine the minced pheasant, pullet, veal, mushrooms, sweetbreads, gammon, bacon, chives, and parsley.
3. Season the mixture with salt, spice blend, and fresh herbs. Mix well to combine.
4. Roll out the pastry crust and line a pie dish with it. Trim any excess dough.
5. Fill the pie dish with the minced meat mixture, pressing it down lightly to remove any air pockets.
6. Roll out another piece of pastry crust and cover the pie, sealing the edges by crimping or pressing with a fork. Cut a few slits on the top crust to allow steam to escape.
7. Place the pie in the preheated oven and bake for about 1 hour, or until the crust is golden brown and the filling is cooked through.
8. While the pie is baking, prepare the mushroom sauce according to your preferred recipe or using a store-bought sauce.
9. Once the pie is cooked, remove it from the oven and let it cool for a few minutes.
10. Pour the mushroom sauce into the pie through one of the slits on the top crust, allowing it to seep into the filling.
11. Serve the pheasant pie hot, either as a main dish or as part of a larger meal.
