# Fouced Turbot

## Description
Fouced Turbot is a dish made by boiling turbot and then marinating it in a flavorful mixture of white wine vinegar, water, and spices. The turbot is then covered and left to marinate, allowing the flavors to infuse into the fish.

## Ingredients:
- 1 turbot (approximately 1.5 kg)
- 500 ml white wine vinegar
- 500 ml water
- 2 teaspoons salt
- Tops of fennel (about 4 sprigs)
- 4 bay leaves
- 1 teaspoon ground ginger
- 1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg
- 1/2 teaspoon ground cloves

## Instructions:
1. Fill a large pot with water and bring it to a boil.
2. Carefully place the turbot into the boiling water and cook for about 10 minutes, or until the fish is cooked through and flakes easily with a fork.
3. Remove the turbot from the pot and transfer it to a large dish.
4. In a separate bowl, combine the white wine vinegar, water, and salt. Stir until the salt is dissolved.
5. Pour the vinegar mixture over the turbot, ensuring that the fish is completely covered.
6. Add the tops of fennel, bay leaves, ginger, nutmeg, and cloves to the dish.
7. Cover the dish with a lid or plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 24 hours, allowing the turbot to marinate and absorb the flavors.
8. Serve the fouced turbot chilled, either as an appetizer or as part of a seafood platter.

## Cooking time
- Boiling the turbot: approximately 10 minutes
- Marinating time: at least 24 hours
