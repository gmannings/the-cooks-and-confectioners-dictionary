# Jelly of Raspberries

## Description
This recipe is for making a delicious jelly using raspberries. The jelly has a smooth and pearl-like texture and can be made with a vibrant red color. It is a sweet and fruity preserve that can be enjoyed on toast, scones, or used as a filling for cakes and pastries.

## Options and commentary
- You can adjust the amount of sugar according to your taste preference. If you prefer a less sweet jelly, you can reduce the amount of sugar.
- To achieve a very red color, you can add red wine or prepared cochineal to the jelly while it is boiling. This will enhance the color and give it a deeper red hue.

## Ingredients:
- 900 grams of raspberries
- 450 grams of currants
- 625 grams of sugar
- Red wine or prepared cochineal (optional)

## Instructions:
1. In a large saucepan, bring the sugar to a "crack'd quality". This means heating the sugar until it reaches the hard crack stage, which is around 150°C (300°F) on a candy thermometer. The sugar will become caramelized and form a hard, brittle consistency.
2. Add the raspberries to the saucepan and bring the mixture to a boil. Skim off any scum that rises to the surface.
3. Continue boiling the mixture, stirring occasionally, until no more scum rises and the syrup reaches a degree between smooth and pearl-like consistency. This may take around 20-30 minutes.
4. If you want the jelly to have a very red color, cover the saucepan while it boils and simmer the mixture. You can also add a small amount of red wine or prepared cochineal to enhance the color. Stir well to incorporate.
5. Once the jelly has reached the desired consistency and color, remove it from the heat and let it cool slightly.
6. Strain the jelly through a fine-mesh sieve or cheesecloth to remove any seeds or solids. Press down gently to extract as much liquid as possible.
7. Pour the strained jelly into sterilized jars and seal tightly.
8. Allow the jelly to cool completely at room temperature before storing it in the refrigerator.
9. The jelly will continue to thicken as it cools. It can be stored in the refrigerator for several weeks.
