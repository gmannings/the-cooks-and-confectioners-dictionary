# Lamprey Pie

## Description
Lamprey Pie is a traditional dish made with lampreys, a type of eel-like fish. The lampreys are cleaned and seasoned with a mixture of salt, pepper, cinnamon, currants, dates, candied lemon peel, and sugar. They are then placed in a pie crust and baked. Once the pie is cooked, the blood of the lampreys and a little white wine are poured into the pie. When serving, a little lemon juice is added for extra flavor.

## Ingredients:
- 4 lampreys, cleaned
- Salt, to taste
- Pepper, to taste
- 1 teaspoon cinnamon
- 1/4 cup currants
- 1/4 cup chopped dates
- 1/4 cup candied lemon peel
- 1/4 cup sugar
- 1 pie crust
- 1/4 cup white wine
- 1 tablespoon lemon juice

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F).
2. Clean the lampreys by removing the slime and any excess fat. Rinse them thoroughly under cold water.
3. In a small bowl, mix together the salt, pepper, cinnamon, currants, dates, candied lemon peel, and sugar.
4. Season the lampreys with the mixture, making sure to coat them evenly.
5. Place the lampreys in the pie crust, arranging them in a single layer.
6. Cover the pie with another layer of pie crust, sealing the edges.
7. Bake the pie in the preheated oven for about 45 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown and the lampreys are cooked through.
8. Remove the pie from the oven and let it cool for a few minutes.
9. In a small saucepan, heat the white wine over low heat until warm.
10. Carefully pour the warm white wine into the pie, allowing it to soak into the lampreys.
11. Just before serving, drizzle the lemon juice over the pie for added freshness and flavor.
