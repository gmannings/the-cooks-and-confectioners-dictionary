# Compost of Cherries

## Description
Compost of Cherries is a sweet and tangy dessert made with cherries cooked in a sugar syrup. The cherries become soft and infused with the sweetness of the syrup. This dish can be served on its own or as a topping for ice cream, yogurt, or cake.

## Ingredients:
- 500g cherries
- 250g sugar
- Water

## Instructions:
1. Cut off the stems of the cherries.
2. In a saucepan, dissolve the sugar in a small amount of water. Use just enough water to dissolve the sugar.
3. Add the cherries to the saucepan and bring the mixture to a boil.
4. Skim off any foam that forms on the surface of the syrup.
5. Reduce the heat and simmer the cherries in the syrup until they become soft and have absorbed the sugar flavor. This may take about 10-15 minutes.
6. If there is too much syrup, continue boiling it for a few more minutes to reduce the amount.
7. Once the cherries are soft and the syrup is at the desired consistency, remove the saucepan from the heat.
8. Let the compost of cherries cool down to room temperature.
9. Transfer the cherries and syrup to a serving dish or jar.
10. The compost of cherries can be served immediately or refrigerated for later use.
