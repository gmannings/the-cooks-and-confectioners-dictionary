# Roasted Duck with Green Peas

## Description
This recipe is a modernized version of an 18th-century dish called "To dels a Duck with green Peas." The duck is first roasted to perfection and then served with a flavorful ragout of green peas. It is a delicious and elegant dish that can be served as a main course for a special occasion.

## Ingredients:
- 1 whole duck
- 500g green peas (fresh or frozen)
- 2 tablespoons unsalted butter
- Salt and pepper to taste
- 1 tablespoon all-purpose flour
- 1 faggot of savory herbs (such as thyme, rosemary, and parsley)
- 1 cup chicken or vegetable broth
- 1 egg yolk
- 2 tablespoons cream

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F).
2. Prepare the duck by cleaning and patting it dry with paper towels. Season the duck generously with salt and pepper.
3. Place the duck on a roasting rack in a roasting pan. Roast the duck in the preheated oven for about 2 to 2 1/2 hours, or until the skin is crispy and the internal temperature reaches 75°C (165°F).
4. While the duck is roasting, prepare the green pea ragout. In a saucepan, melt the butter over medium heat.
5. Add the green peas to the saucepan and sauté for a few minutes until they are slightly softened.
6. Season the peas with salt, pepper, and a dusting of flour. Stir well to coat the peas with the flour.
7. Add the faggot of savory herbs to the saucepan and pour in the chicken or vegetable broth. Stir to combine.
8. Simmer the peas over low heat for about 10 minutes, or until they are tender. Remove the faggot of herbs from the saucepan.
9. In a small bowl, whisk together the egg yolk and cream until well combined.
10. Gradually pour the egg yolk mixture into the saucepan with the peas, stirring constantly. This will thicken the sauce.
11. Continue to cook the peas for another 2 minutes, stirring constantly, until the sauce is thickened and creamy.
12. Once the duck is cooked, remove it from the oven and let it rest for about 10 minutes before carving.
13. Carve the duck into serving pieces and arrange them on a serving platter.
14. Pour the green pea ragout over the duck pieces, making sure to coat them evenly.
15. Serve the roasted duck with green peas immediately.
