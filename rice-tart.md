# Rice Tart

## Description
A Rice Tart is a sweet and creamy dessert made with cooked rice, eggs, and a blend of spices. The tart is baked until golden and then topped with a sprinkle of sugar. It has a smooth and comforting texture with a hint of warmth from the spices.

## Options and commentary
- You can use either milk or cream to cook the rice. Cream will result in a richer and creamier tart.
- Adjust the amount of spices according to your taste preferences.
- You can add some raisins or chopped nuts to the filling for added texture and flavor.
- Serve the tart warm or chilled, depending on your preference.

## Ingredients:
- 200g rice
- 500ml milk or cream
- Pinch of salt
- 1/4 teaspoon pepper
- 2 tablespoons sugar
- 1/4 teaspoon nutmeg
- 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
- 1/4 teaspoon ginger
- 6-8 egg yolks
- Juice of 1 orange
- 1 pre-made tart crust
- 1 tablespoon sugar (for sprinkling)

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F).
2. In a saucepan, combine the rice and milk or cream. Bring to a boil over medium heat.
3. Reduce the heat to low and simmer the rice, stirring occasionally, until it is tender and has absorbed most of the liquid. This will take about 15-20 minutes.
4. Remove the saucepan from the heat and let the rice cool slightly.
5. In a mixing bowl, combine the cooked rice, salt, pepper, sugar, nutmeg, cinnamon, and ginger. Mix well to evenly distribute the spices.
6. Add the egg yolks to the rice mixture and stir until everything is well combined.
7. Squeeze the juice of the orange into the rice mixture and stir again.
8. Place the pre-made tart crust in a tart pan or pie dish.
9. Pour the rice mixture into the tart crust, spreading it evenly.
10. Cover the tart with another layer of pastry or use the excess pastry to create a lattice pattern on top.
11. Bake the tart in the preheated oven for about 30-35 minutes, or until the crust is golden and the filling is set.
12. Remove the tart from the oven and let it cool for a few minutes.
13. Sprinkle the top of the tart with sugar.
14. Serve the Rice Tart warm or chilled, as desired.
