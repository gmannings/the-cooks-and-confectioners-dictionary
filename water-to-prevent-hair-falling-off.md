# Water to Prevent Hair Falling Off

## Description
This recipe provides different options for preventing hair loss. It suggests steeping pigeon dung in lye, boiling oak leaves or middle rind in water, or pounding walnut leaves with bear's fat to create a solution to wash the head with.

## Options and commentary
- Option 1: Steep pigeon dung in lye. This option may not be practical or desirable for most modern home cooks due to the unavailability of pigeon dung and the unpleasant odor it may produce.
- Option 2: Boil oak leaves or middle rind in water. This option is more feasible and can be easily done by simmering oak leaves or the middle rind in water to create a hair wash solution.
- Option 3: Pound walnut leaves with bear's fat. This option may be difficult to replicate as bear's fat is not commonly available. However, you can substitute it with another type of fat or oil, such as coconut oil or olive oil.

## Ingredients:
- Option 1:
  - Pigeon dung
  - Lye (caustic soda)
- Option 2:
  - Oak leaves or middle rind
  - Water
- Option 3:
  - Walnut leaves
  - Bear's fat (or substitute with coconut oil or olive oil)

## Instructions:
1. Option 1:
   1. Steep pigeon dung in lye:
      - In a container, combine pigeon dung and lye in a ratio of 1:4 (for example, 1 cup of pigeon dung to 4 cups of lye).
      - Stir well to ensure the dung is fully submerged in the lye.
      - Allow the mixture to steep for several days, stirring occasionally.
      - Strain the liquid to remove any solid particles.

      - In a pot, add oak leaves or middle rind and cover with water.
      - Bring the water to a boil and then reduce the heat to a simmer.
      - Allow the leaves or rind to simmer for about 30 minutes.
      - Remove from heat and strain the liquid to remove any solid particles.
   2. Proceed to step 4 for all options.
3. Option 3:
   1. Pound walnut leaves with bear's fat:
      - In a mortar and pestle, pound walnut leaves until they form a paste.
      - Add bear's fat (or substitute) to the walnut paste and continue pounding until well combined.
      - Transfer the mixture to a container.
   2. Proceed to step 4 for all options.
4. Wash the head with the prepared solution:
   - Apply the solution to the scalp and hair, gently massaging it in.
   - Leave the solution on for a few minutes.
   - Rinse thoroughly with water.
   - Repeat the process as desired.

## Cooking time
