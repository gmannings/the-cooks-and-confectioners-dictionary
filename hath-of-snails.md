# Hath of Snails

## Description
Hath of Snails is a dish made with boiled and minced snails, cooked in a flavorful sauce with various spices and herbs. It is traditionally served with toasted French bread.

## Ingredients:
- Snails (approximately 500g)
- Butter or oil (2 tablespoons)
- Salt (to taste)
- Pepper (to taste)
- Nutmeg (a pinch)
- Capers (2 tablespoons)
- Pistachios (2 tablespoons)
- Hard-boiled egg yolks (2)
- Fresh herbs (such as parsley or thyme) (a handful)
- French bread (4 slices)

## Instructions:
1. Boil the snails in a pot of water until they are cooked through. This should take about 10-15 minutes. Drain the snails and set them aside to cool.
2. Once the snails have cooled, clean them by removing any remaining shells or debris. Mince the snails into small pieces.
3. In a pipkin or saucepan, melt the butter or heat the oil over medium heat.
4. Add the minced snails to the pipkin and season with salt, pepper, and nutmeg. Stir well to combine.
5. Add the capers, pistachios, and the yolks of the hard-boiled eggs to the pipkin. Stir to incorporate all the ingredients.
6. Finally, add the shredded fresh herbs to the pipkin and continue to cook over low heat for about 30 minutes, stirring occasionally.
7. While the snails are stewing, prepare the toasts. Slice the French bread into 4 thick slices and fry them in a pan with a little butter or oil until they are golden and crispy.
8. To serve, place the fried toasts in the bottom of a dish and arrange some additional toasts around the snail mixture.
9. Spoon the snail mixture over the toasts and serve hot.
