# Bzide Pye

## Description
Bzide Pye is a rich and flavorful meat pie filled with a variety of ingredients including cockscombs, sweetbreads, oysters, bacon, chestnuts, broom buds, pine kernels, and dates. The pie is seasoned with salt, nutmeg, and whole mace, and topped with a buttery lid. After baking, a mixture of beaten butter, egg yolks, wine, and lemon juice is poured into the pie to add richness and flavor.

## Ingredients:
- 2 cockscombs
- 2 veal sweetbreads
- 2 lamb stones
- 2 ox palates
- 1 pint of oysters

- Salt, to taste
- Nutmeg, to taste
- Whole mace, to taste
- 1 pie crust
- 4 tablespoons of butter
- 3-4 egg yolks
- 2 tablespoons of white wine

## Instructions:
1. Parboil the cockscombs, veal sweetbreads, lamb stones, and ox palates until partially cooked. Drain and cut them into slices.
2. Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F).
3. In a bowl, combine the sliced meats with the oysters, bacon, chestnuts, broom buds, pine kernels, and sliced dates.
4. Season the mixture with salt, nutmeg, and whole mace to taste.
5. Roll out the pie crust and line a pie dish with it.
6. Fill the pie crust with the meat and ingredient mixture.
7. Dot the top of the filling with slices of butter.
8. Cover the pie with another layer of pie crust and seal the edges.
9. Bake the pie in the preheated oven for about 45-60 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown and the filling is cooked through.
10. In a separate bowl, beat together the butter, egg yolks, white wine, and lemon juice until well combined.
11. Remove the pie from the oven and cut a small hole in the top crust to vent steam.
12. Pour the butter, egg yolk, wine, and lemon mixture into the hole in the top crust, allowing it to seep into the filling.
13. Serve the Bzide Pye hot, with the flavorful filling and rich buttery sauce.
