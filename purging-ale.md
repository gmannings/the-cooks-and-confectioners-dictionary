# Purging Ale

## Description
Purging Ale is a medicinal drink from the 18th century that was believed to have purifying properties. It is made by infusing a variety of herbs, roots, seeds, and fruits in ale. This recipe calls for a combination of garden-scurvy-grass, burdock roots, blue currants, rhubarb, horse-radish roots, monk's rhubarb, sharp-pointed dock, mechoacan, sena, coriander seeds, caraway seeds, anise seeds, and daucus seeds, along with sliced oranges. The ingredients are placed in a canvas bag with a stone and hung in ale to ferment for three days.
