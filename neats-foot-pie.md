# Neats Foot Pie

## Description
Neats Foot Pie is a traditional dish made with minced neats foot (calf's foot) and beef, seasoned with spices and sweetened with sugar. It is then baked in a crust with dried fruits and served hot.

## Options and commentary
- Neats foot can be difficult to find, so you can substitute it with beef or veal.
- You can use store-bought pie crust or make your own.
- You can adjust the amount of sugar and spices according to your taste preference.
- You can add other dried fruits like raisins, currants, or cranberries for added flavor.

## Ingredients:
- 500g minced beef or veal
- 500g beef suet (or substitute with vegetable shortening)
- Salt to taste
- 1/2 teaspoon ground cloves
- 1/2 teaspoon ground mace
- 2 tablespoons sugar
- 1/2 teaspoon grated nutmeg
- 100g raisins
- 100g currants
- 100g barberries (or substitute with cranberries)

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F).
2. In a large pot, boil the neats foot (or beef/veal) until tender. Remove the bones and mince the meat.
3. In a mixing bowl, combine the minced meat with the minced beef suet (or vegetable shortening).
4. Season the mixture with salt, ground cloves, ground mace, sugar, and grated nutmeg. Mix well to combine.
5. Add the raisins, currants, and barberries (or cranberries) to the mixture and stir until evenly distributed.
6. Roll out the pie crust and line a pie dish with it.
7. Fill the pie crust with the meat mixture, spreading it evenly.
8. Cover the pie with another layer of pie crust and seal the edges.
9. Make a few small slits on the top crust to allow steam to escape during baking.
10. Place the pie in the preheated oven and bake for about 45-60 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown and the filling is cooked through.
11. Remove the pie from the oven and let it cool for a few minutes before serving.
