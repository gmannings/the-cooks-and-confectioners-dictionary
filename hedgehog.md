# Hedgehog

## Description
Hedgehog is a dessert made from a mixture of almonds, eggs, cream, and butter. The mixture is shaped into the form of a hedgehog and decorated with blanched almonds to resemble the bristles. It is then served with a sweetened cream sauce.

## Ingredients:
- 450g blanched almonds
- 50ml Canary wine (or any sweet white wine)
- 50ml orange flower water
- 12 egg yolks
- 14 egg whites
- 240ml cream
- Sugar, to taste
- 225g unsalted butter, melted

## Instructions:
1. In a mortar, grind the blanched almonds until they form a fine paste.
2. Add the Canary wine and orange flower water to the almond paste to prevent it from becoming oily. Mix well.
3. In a separate bowl, beat the egg yolks and egg whites together until well combined.
4. Add the beaten eggs to the almond paste and mix well.
5. Stir in the cream and sweeten with sugar to your taste.
6. Pour the melted butter into the mixture and stir until well incorporated.
7. Transfer the mixture to a saucepan and place it on low heat.
8. Stir the mixture constantly until it thickens enough to be shaped into a hedgehog.
9. Remove the mixture from the heat and shape it into the form of a hedgehog.
10. Insert blanched almonds into the mixture to resemble the bristles of a hedgehog.
11. In a separate saucepan, heat some cream.
12. In a bowl, whisk together the egg yolks and sugar until well combined.
13. Slowly pour the heated cream into the egg yolk mixture, whisking constantly.
14. Return the mixture to the saucepan and cook over low heat until it thickens.
