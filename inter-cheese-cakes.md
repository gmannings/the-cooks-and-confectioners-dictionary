# Inter Cheese-cakes

## Description
Inter Cheese-cakes are a type of sweet pastry filled with a creamy cheese filling. They were popular in the 18th century and make for a delightful dessert or snack.

## Options and commentary
- You can use any type of soft cheese for the filling, such as cream cheese or ricotta.
- Feel free to add flavorings to the filling, such as lemon zest or vanilla extract.
- You can use store-bought pastry dough or make your own from scratch.

## Ingredients:
- 5 eggs
- 1 pint (473 ml) cream
- 1 small biscuit, grated
- 3/4 pound (340 grams) butter
- 1 pound (454 grams) flour
- Milk, as needed

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 350°F (180°C).

2. To make the curd, crack the eggs into a bowl and whisk them lightly. Add the cream and grated biscuit to the bowl and mix well until combined.

3. In a separate bowl, combine the flour and butter. Use your hands or a pastry cutter to mix the butter into the flour until it resembles coarse crumbs.

4. Gradually add milk to the flour mixture, a little at a time, until the dough becomes stiff and holds together. You may not need to use all the milk.

5. On a lightly floured surface, roll out the dough to a thickness of about 1/4 inch (0.6 cm). 

6. Use a round cookie cutter or a glass to cut out circles from the dough. 

7. Grease a muffin tin or line it with cupcake liners. Place each dough circle into a muffin cup, pressing it gently to fit the shape.

8. Fill each pastry cup with the curd mixture, leaving a small space at the top for the filling to expand during baking.

9. Bake the cheese-cakes in the preheated oven for about 20-25 minutes, or until the pastry is golden brown and the filling is set.

10. Remove the cheese-cakes from the oven and let them cool in the muffin tin for a few minutes. Then transfer them to a wire rack to cool completely.

11. Serve the inter cheese-cakes at room temperature or chilled. They can be enjoyed on their own or with a dollop of whipped cream or fruit compote.

## Cooking time
