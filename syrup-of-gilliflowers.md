# Syrup of Gilliflowers

## Description
Syrup of Gilliflowers is a sweet and fragrant syrup made from the petals of gilliflowers (clove-scented pink or carnation flowers) and sugar. It can be used as a flavoring for drinks, desserts, or as a topping for pancakes or waffles.

## Ingredients:
- Gilliflowers (clove-scented pink or carnation flowers)
- Water
- Sugar

## Instructions:
1. Clip the gilliflowers, removing the petals from the stems.
2. Sprinkle the petals with a little bit of water to moisten them.
3. Place the petals into an earthen pot and seal it tightly.
4. Fill a kettle with water and place the earthen pot inside.
5. Bring the water in the kettle to a boil and let it simmer for two hours, ensuring that the pot remains submerged in the water.
6. After two hours, remove the pot from the kettle and allow it to cool slightly.
7. Strain out the juice from the petals using a fine-mesh strainer or cheesecloth.
8. Measure the amount of juice obtained and pour it into a skillet.
9. For every pint of juice, add one and a half pounds of sugar to the skillet.
10. Place the skillet on the stove over low heat and stir continuously until the sugar is completely melted. Do not let the mixture come to a boil.
11. Once the sugar has melted, remove the skillet from the heat and let the syrup cool.
12. Transfer the cooled syrup into bottles for storage.
