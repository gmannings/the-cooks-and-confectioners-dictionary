# Flew Ducks

## Description
Flew Ducks is a traditional dish from the 18th century that involves partially roasting ducks and then stewing them in a flavorful broth. The dish is typically garnished with crispy fried bacon. It is a hearty and rich dish that is perfect for a special occasion or a comforting meal.

## Ingredients:
- 2 ducks
- 1 pint (473 ml) of red wine (Claret)
- 1 pint (473 ml) of strong broth (such as beef or vegetable broth)
- 2 onions, quartered
- 1 bunch of fresh herbs (such as thyme, rosemary, and parsley)
- 1/2 teaspoon of freshly ground black pepper
- 4 slices of bacon, fried until crispy

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F).
2. Place the ducks on a roasting rack in a roasting pan and roast them in the preheated oven for about 30 minutes, or until they are half cooked. This will help render some of the fat and give the ducks a nice golden color.
3. Remove the ducks from the oven and transfer them to a stew-pan.
4. Add the red wine, strong broth, quartered onions, fresh herbs, and freshly ground black pepper to the stew-pan with the ducks.
5. Cover the stew-pan and place it on the stove over medium heat.
6. Bring the liquid to a simmer and then reduce the heat to low. Let the ducks stew gently for about 1 to 1 1/2 hours, or until they are tender and fully cooked. Stir occasionally to ensure even cooking.
7. Once the ducks are cooked, remove them from the stew-pan and transfer them to a serving platter.
8. Garnish the ducks with the crispy fried bacon.
9. Serve the Flew Ducks hot with the stewing liquid as a sauce on the side.

## Cooking time
Approximately 2 to 2 1/2 hours.
