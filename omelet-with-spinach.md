# Omelet with Spinach

## Description
This recipe is for a delicious omelet filled with creamy spinach. The spinach is blanched, fried in butter with parsley and shallots, then cooked with cream. The omelet is made with cream and fresh eggs, seasoned with salt. The spinach is thickened with egg yolks and poured over the omelet, creating a flavorful and satisfying dish.

## Ingredients:
- 200g spinach
- 2 tablespoons butter
- 1 tablespoon chopped parsley
- 1 shallot, finely chopped
- 100ml cream
- 4 eggs
- Salt, to taste

## Instructions:
1. Blanch the spinach by placing it in a pot of boiling water for 1-2 minutes. Drain and rinse with cold water to stop the cooking process. Squeeze out any excess water from the spinach and roughly chop it.
2. In a frying pan, melt the butter over medium heat. Add the chopped parsley and shallot and cook until softened.
3. Add the chopped spinach to the pan and stir well to combine with the butter, parsley, and shallot. Cook for 2-3 minutes.
4. Pour in the cream and season with salt. Stir well and let the mixture simmer over low heat for about 5 minutes, until the spinach is cooked and the flavors are well combined.
5. In a separate bowl, whisk together the eggs and cream. Season with salt.
6. Heat a non-stick frying pan over medium heat. Pour in the egg mixture and let it cook for a minute or two, until the edges start to set.
7. Carefully spoon the spinach mixture onto one half of the omelet. Fold the other half over the filling and cook for another minute, until the omelet is cooked through.
8. Slide the omelet onto a serving dish.
9. In a small bowl, whisk together the egg yolks. Gradually pour the yolks into the spinach mixture, stirring constantly, until the spinach thickens slightly.
10. Pour the thickened spinach over the omelet, allowing it to stick to the sides.
11. Serve the omelet hot.
