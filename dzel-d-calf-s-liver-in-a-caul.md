# Dzel'd Calf's Liver in a Caul

## Description
This dish is a modernized version of an 18th-century recipe for calf's liver cooked in a caul (the fatty membrane that surrounds the internal organs of an animal). The liver is finely shredded and mixed with mushrooms, truffles, onions, and a blend of spices. It is then combined with a mixture of cream, milk, and eggs, seasoned with herbs, and cooked in a caul to create a flavorful and rich dish.

## Options and commentary
- Instead of using a calf's liver, you can use beef liver or chicken liver as a substitute.
- If you don't have access to mushrooms or truffles, you can use other flavorful vegetables like shallots or leeks.
- Feel free to adjust the seasoning according to your taste preferences.
- The cooking time may vary depending on the size and thickness of the liver, so it's important to check for doneness.

## Ingredients:
- 500g calf's liver (or beef liver or chicken liver)
- 100g mushrooms, finely chopped
- 50g truffles, finely chopped (optional)
- 2 onions, roasted and peeled
- 6 cloves
- 1 tablespoon coriander seeds
- 1 pint (500ml) cream
- 1/2 pint (250ml) milk
- 7-8 eggs
- 100g suet, finely shredded
- Salt and pepper to taste
- Fresh herbs (such as parsley, thyme, or sage), chopped
- 1 caul (the fatty membrane from the animal's internal organs)
- Beaten egg, for brushing
- Grated bread, for dusting

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F).

2. Remove the under skins from the liver and shred it very finely. 

3. In a bowl, combine the shredded liver, mushrooms, truffles, and finely chopped roasted onions.

4. In a mortar, pound the cloves and coriander seeds until they are finely ground. Add them to the liver mixture and mix well.

5. In a separate bowl, whisk together the cream, milk, and eggs until well combined. Be careful not to let the mixture curdle.

6. In a pan, melt half of the shredded suet until it is half melted. Pour it into the cream and egg mixture and mix well.

7. Add the liver mixture to the cream and egg mixture. Season with salt, pepper, and chopped fresh herbs. Mix everything together until well combined. Let the mixture stand until it is cold.

8. Spread the caul over the bottom and sides of a stewpan, ensuring that it covers the entire surface.

9. Place the liver mixture, cream, and all, into the stewpan, shaping it into the form of a calf's liver. Fold the caul over the liver mixture to enclose it completely.

10. Turn the stewpan upside down and place it in an oven-safe dish. Brush the surface of the caul with beaten egg and sprinkle with grated bread.

11. Bake the dish in the preheated oven for approximately 45 minutes to 1 hour, or until the liver is cooked through and the caul is golden brown.

12. Serve the dzel'd calf's liver hot as the first course of a meal.
