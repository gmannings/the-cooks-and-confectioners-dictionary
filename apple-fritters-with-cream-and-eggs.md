# Apple Fritters with Cream and Eggs

## Description
This recipe is for a sweet and creamy dessert dish made with apples, eggs, cream, and spices. The apples are sliced and fried until golden, then layered with a mixture of beaten eggs, cream, sugar, nutmeg, and mace. The dish is finished with a squeeze of orange juice and a sprinkle of sugar.

## Options and commentary
- You can use any variety of apples for this recipe, but tart apples like Granny Smith work well to balance the sweetness.
- Feel free to adjust the amount of sugar and spices to suit your taste preferences.
- Serve the fritters warm with a dollop of whipped cream or a scoop of vanilla ice cream for an extra indulgent treat.

## Ingredients:
- 4 eggs
- 1 cup cream
- 2 tablespoons rosewater
- 1/4 cup sugar
- 1/4 teaspoon nutmeg
- 1/4 teaspoon mace
- 2-3 apples, peeled, cored, and sliced
- Butter, for frying
- Juice of 1 orange
- Sugar, for sprinkling

## Instructions:
1. In a bowl, beat together 2 eggs, 1/2 cup cream, rosewater, sugar, nutmeg, and mace until well combined.
2. Heat a frying pan over medium heat and melt a tablespoon of butter.
3. Add the apple slices to the pan and fry them until golden and tender. Remove the apple slices from the pan and set aside.
4. In the same pan, melt another tablespoon of butter and pour in half of the egg and cream mixture. Stir continuously, as you would for a custard, until the mixture thickens and cooks through. Transfer the cooked mixture to a serving dish.
5. Repeat step 4 with the remaining butter and egg and cream mixture.
6. Arrange the fried apple slices around the edges of the serving dish, on top of the cooked egg and cream mixture.
7. Fry the remaining 2 eggs in the pan until cooked to your liking. Place the fried eggs on top of the apple slices.
8. Squeeze the juice of an orange over the dish and sprinkle with sugar.
9. Serve the apple fritters warm.
