# Fried Pork Slices with Gravy

## Description
This recipe is for fried pork slices that are then simmered in a flavorful broth until tender. The pork slices are served with a rich mutton gravy and a hint of tanginess from lemon juice.

## Ingredients:
- 500g pork loin, sliced
- 2 tablespoons lard or butter
- 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
- 250ml broth (chicken or vegetable)
- Salt, to taste
- Pepper, to taste
- 1/4 teaspoon nutmeg
- 1 tablespoon fresh herbs (such as parsley or thyme), chopped
- Mutton gravy (store-bought or homemade)
- Lemon juice, to taste

## Instructions:
1. In a large skillet, heat the lard or butter over medium heat.
2. Add the pork slices to the skillet and fry them until they are browned on both sides.
3. Sprinkle the flour over the pork slices and stir well to coat them evenly. Cook for an additional minute to cook off the raw flour taste.
4. Pour the broth into the skillet, stirring constantly to prevent lumps from forming. Season with salt, pepper, nutmeg, and fresh herbs.
5. Reduce the heat to low and simmer the pork slices in the broth for about 30 minutes, or until they are tender and cooked through. Stir occasionally to prevent sticking.
6. While the pork is simmering, prepare the mutton gravy according to the package instructions or make your own homemade gravy.
7. Once the pork slices are cooked, remove them from the skillet and transfer them to a serving dish. Keep them warm.
8. Increase the heat to medium-high and cook the broth until it thickens and reduces to a sauce-like consistency. This should take about 5-10 minutes.
9. Pour the thickened sauce over the pork slices in the serving dish.
10. Serve the fried pork slices with mutton gravy on the side and a squeeze of fresh lemon juice.
