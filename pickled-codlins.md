# Pickled Codlins

## Description
This recipe is for pickling codlins, a type of apple, to resemble the flavor and texture of mangoes. The codlins are soaked in a strong brine for ten days, then dried and cored before being filled with a mixture of spices and vinegar.

## Options and commentary
- Codlins can be substituted with any firm and tart apple variety, such as Granny Smith or Bramley.
- Adjust the amount of salt in the brine to taste.
- Feel free to experiment with different spices and flavorings in the filling.

## Ingredients:
- 1 kg codlins (or tart apples)
- Water
- Salt
- 2 cups white vinegar
- 1 cup sugar
- 1 tablespoon mustard seeds
- 1 tablespoon whole cloves
- 1 tablespoon ground turmeric
- 1 tablespoon ground ginger

## Instructions:
1. In a large pot, prepare a brine by combining water and salt. The brine should be strong enough to float an egg. Use approximately 1 liter of water and 1/4 cup of salt.
2. Wash the codlins (or apples) and place them in the brine. Make sure they are fully submerged. Let them soak in the brine for ten days, stirring the brine once every two days.
3. After ten days, remove the codlins from the brine and pat them dry with a clean kitchen towel.
4. Using a sharp knife or an apple corer, carefully scoop out the cores of the codlins, leaving the bottom intact. Remove the stalks as well.
5. In a saucepan, combine the white vinegar, sugar, mustard seeds, whole cloves, ground turmeric, and ground ginger. Bring the mixture to a boil and let it simmer for 5 minutes.
6. Carefully place the codlins in sterilized jars, ensuring they fit snugly. Pour the hot vinegar mixture over the codlins, making sure they are completely covered.
7. Seal the jars tightly and let them cool to room temperature. Store the pickled codlins in a cool, dark place for at least two weeks before consuming. The longer they sit, the better the flavors will develop.
