# Baked Ox Cheeks

## Description
This recipe is for baking ox cheeks to be eaten cold. The ox cheeks are stuffed with salt and spices, then baked in a pot with claret and bay leaves. After baking, the cheeks are served cold and dressed with bay leaves. This dish is reminiscent of venison and is traditionally eaten with mustard and sugar.
