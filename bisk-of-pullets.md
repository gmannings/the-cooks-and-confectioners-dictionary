# Bisk of Pullets

## Description
Bisk of Pullets is a rich and flavorful stew made with fried pullets (young chickens), bacon, beef, citron, herbs, and seasoning. It is garnished with cockscombs, veal sweetbreads, mushrooms, truffles, and artichoke bottoms. The stew is finished with a ring of garnishes and the potage is marbled with lemon juice and veal cullis.

## Options and commentary
- You can use chicken instead of pullets if they are not available.
- If you cannot find citron, you can substitute with lemon or orange zest.
- Cockscombs, veal sweetbreads, mushrooms, truffles, and artichoke bottoms are optional garnishes and can be omitted if desired.
- Veal cullis is a rich sauce made from veal stock. You can make it from scratch or use a store-bought alternative.

## Ingredients:
- 2 pullets (or 2 chickens)
- 4 slices of fat bacon
- 1-2 slices of lean bacon
- 1-2 slices of beef, beaten
- 1 citron (or lemon or orange), zest only
- 4 cloves
- 1 bunch of fresh herbs (such as parsley, thyme, and bay leaves)
- Salt and pepper to taste
- Cockscombs (optional, for garnish)
- Veal sweetbreads (optional, for garnish)
- Mushrooms (optional, for garnish)
- Truffles (optional, for garnish)
- Artichoke bottoms (optional, for garnish)
- Lemon juice, for marbling
- Veal cullis, for marbling

## Instructions:
1. Truss the pullets neatly.
2. In a large pot or Dutch oven, fry the pullets until browned on all sides. Remove the pullets from the pot and set aside.
3. In the same pot, add the fat bacon, lean bacon, and beaten beef slices. Cook until the bacon is crispy and the beef is browned.
4. Return the pullets to the pot and add enough good broth to cover the pullets.
5. Add the citron zest, cloves, bunch of fresh herbs, and season with salt and pepper to taste.
6. Set the pot over a gentle fire and stew the pullets for about 1-2 hours, or until the meat is tender and cooked through.
7. While the pullets are stewing, prepare the garnishes if using. Cook the cockscombs, veal sweetbreads, mushrooms, truffles, and artichoke bottoms separately according to their individual cooking instructions.
8. Once the pullets are cooked, remove them from the pot and keep warm.
9. Strain the cooking liquid to remove any solids and return it to the pot.
10. To marble the potage, add lemon juice and veal cullis to the pot and stir gently to create a marbled effect.
11. To serve, place the pullets in a serving dish and arrange the garnishes around them. Pour the marbled potage over the pullets and garnishes.
12. Serve hot and enjoy!
