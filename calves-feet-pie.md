# Calves Feet Pie

## Description
Calves Feet Pie is a traditional 18th-century dish made with boiled calves feet, raisins, currants, citrus peel, spices, and eggs. The pie is layered with butter, calves feet, raisins, and the mixture of currants, citrus peel, spices, and sugar. It is then topped with boiled eggs and baked until golden brown.

## Ingredients:
- 4 calves feet
- 1 pie crust
- 200g butter, sliced
- 200g raisins
- 100g currants
- 50g candied citron peel, sliced
- 1 lemon, peel sliced
- 1 orange, peel sliced
- 1/2 teaspoon ground mace
- 1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg
- 1/4 teaspoon ground cloves
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 50g fine sugar
- 3 hard-boiled eggs, sliced

## Instructions:
1. Place the calves feet in a large pot and cover with water. Bring to a boil and cook until the feet are very tender, about 2-3 hours.
2. Remove the calves feet from the pot and let them cool slightly. Remove the bones and cut the meat into small pieces.
3. Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F).
4. Roll out the pie crust and line a pie dish with it.
5. Layer the bottom of the pie crust with half of the sliced butter.
6. Add a layer of the cooked calves feet on top of the butter.
7. Sprinkle half of the raisins over the calves feet.
8. Add another layer of calves feet, followed by the remaining raisins.
9. In a bowl, mix together the currants, candied citron peel, lemon peel, orange peel, mace, nutmeg, cloves, salt, and sugar.
10. Spread half of this mixture over the raisins in the pie crust.
11. Repeat the layers of calves feet, raisins, and currant mixture until the pie crust is filled.
12. Arrange the sliced hard-boiled eggs on top of the pie.
13. Place the remaining sliced butter on top of the eggs.
14. Cover the pie with another layer of pie crust and seal the edges.
15. Make a few small slits in the top crust to allow steam to escape.
16. Bake the pie in the preheated oven for about 45-50 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown.
17. Remove from the oven and let the pie cool slightly before serving.

## Cooking time
Approximately 3 hours (including boiling the calves feet) + 45-50 minutes baking time.
