2. Place the pot over medium heat and bring the mixture to a boil.
3. Reduce the heat to low and let the mixture simmer for about 10 minutes, allowing the flavors to infuse.
4. Add the finely ground blanched almonds and white wine to the pot.
5. Continue to simmer the mixture for another 10 minutes, stirring occasionally to prevent sticking.
