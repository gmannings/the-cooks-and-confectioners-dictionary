# Whipped Cake with Orange and Ambergreefe

## Description
This recipe is for a light and fluffy whipped cake flavored with orange and a hint of ambergreefe. The cake is topped with a sweet icing. It is a delicate and fragrant dessert that would be perfect for a special occasion or afternoon tea.

## Options and commentary
- You can use an electric mixer to whip the egg whites and sugar, or you can do it by hand if you prefer.
- If you can't find ambergreefe, you can omit it or substitute with a small amount of vanilla extract for flavor.
- The icing can be made with powdered sugar and orange juice for a simple glaze, or you can use your favorite icing recipe.

## Ingredients:
- 5 egg whites
- 225g sifted double-refined sugar
- 3 tablespoons orange water
- A pinch of ambergreefe (or substitute with vanilla extract)

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 180Â°C.
2. In a large mixing bowl, whip the egg whites until they form stiff peaks.
3. Gradually add the sifted sugar to the whipped egg whites, continuing to whip until the mixture is thick and glossy.
4. Gently fold in the orange water and ambergreefe (or vanilla extract) until well combined.
5. Pour the batter into a greased and lined cake tin.
6. Place the cake tin in the preheated oven and bake for approximately 30-35 minutes, or until the cake is golden brown and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.
7. Remove the cake from the oven and let it cool completely on a wire rack.
8. Once the cake is cooled, prepare the icing by mixing powdered sugar with a small amount of orange juice until you reach a smooth and pourable consistency.
9. Drizzle the icing over the top of the cake, allowing it to drip down the sides.
10. Let the icing set before serving.
