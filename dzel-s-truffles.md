# Dzel's Truffles

## Description
Dzel's Truffles is a savory dish made with truffles stewed in white wine or claret, seasoned with salt, pepper, and bay leaves. Truffles are a type of edible fungi known for their strong and earthy flavor. This dish is a delicious and elegant way to enjoy the unique taste of truffles.

## Ingredients:
- 500g truffles
- 500ml white wine or claret
- Salt, to taste
- Pepper, to taste
- 2 bay leaves

## Instructions:
1. Clean the truffles by gently brushing off any dirt or debris. Rinse them under cold water and pat dry with a paper towel.
2. Slice the truffles into thin slices or small cubes, depending on your preference.
3. In a large saucepan, pour the white wine or claret and bring it to a simmer over medium heat.
4. Add the sliced truffles to the simmering wine and season with salt, pepper, and bay leaves.
5. Reduce the heat to low and cover the saucepan with a lid. Let the truffles simmer gently for about 30 minutes, or until they are tender and infused with the flavors of the wine and seasonings.
6. Stir the truffles occasionally to ensure even cooking and to prevent them from sticking to the bottom of the pan.
7. Once the truffles are cooked, remove them from the heat and discard the bay leaves.
8. Serve the Dzel's Truffles as a side dish or as a topping for grilled meats or roasted vegetables.
