# Leg of Mutton a la Dauphine

## Description
Leg of mutton cooked with bacon lardons and served with a ragout of vegetables or a sauce made from ham.

## Options and commentary
- Instead of larding the mutton with bacon, you can use pancetta or prosciutto.
- For the ragout, you can use a combination of cucumbers, young onions, and succory, or any other vegetables of your choice.
- The sauce can be made with a good quality stock or broth, or you can use a ham bone to make an essence of ham.

## Ingredients:
- 1 leg of mutton
- Bacon lardons or pancetta/prosciutto
- Vegetables for ragout (e.g., cucumbers, young onions, succory)
- Stock or broth (or ham bone for essence of ham)

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to the desired temperature.
2. Remove all the skin and flesh from the shank bone of the leg of mutton. Also, remove any excess fat and scrape it clean.
3. Parboil the leg of mutton in a pot of boiling water for a few minutes.
4. Lard the leg of mutton by inserting small lardons of bacon (or pancetta/prosciutto) into the meat.
5. Spit the leg of mutton and place it on a roasting pan. Cover it with parchment paper.
6. Roast the leg of mutton in the preheated oven with a soft fire (low heat) until it is well colored and cooked to your desired doneness.
7. While the leg of mutton is roasting, prepare the ragout by cooking the chosen vegetables in a separate pan until they are tender.
8. Once the leg of mutton is roasted enough, remove it from the oven and transfer it to a serving dish.
9. Serve the leg of mutton with the prepared ragout of vegetables on the side.
10. Alternatively, you can serve the leg of mutton with a cullis (a thickened sauce) made from stock or broth, or with an essence of ham made from a ham bone.

## Cooking time
The cooking time will vary depending on the size of the leg of mutton and the desired doneness. As a general guideline, roast the leg of mutton for about 20 minutes per pound (450 grams) at a low temperature (around 325°F or 160°C). Use a meat thermometer to check for doneness. The internal temperature should reach 145°F (63°C) for medium-rare or 160°F (71°C) for medium.
