# Co fouce Tench

## Description
Co fouce Tench is a dish made with boiled tench fish served in a jelly-like sauce. The fish is cooked in a seasoned water mixture and then served with the strained cooking liquid that has been thickened with isinglass. This dish can also be used to make jelly for other seafood like lobsters, prawns, or crayfish.

## Ingredients:
- 1 Tench fish
- Vinegar
- Salt
- Bay leaves
- Sweet herbs (such as parsley, thyme, and tarragon)
- Whole cloves
- Mace
- Isinglass (gelatin can be used as a modern alternative)

## Instructions:
1. Draw the Tench by removing the gills and cutting them off. This will help the fish boil whiter.
2. Season a pot of water with vinegar, salt, bay leaves, sweet herbs, whole cloves, and mace.
3. Wipe the Tench clean, but do not scale it.
4. Bring the seasoned water to a boil and add the Tench.
5. Boil the Tench until cooked.
6. Remove the Tench from the water and wash off any loose scales.
7. Strain the cooking liquid through a jelly bag.
8. Place some isinglass (or gelatin) into the strained cooking liquid and boil it.
9. Place the cooked Tench into a serving dish.
10. Pour the strained and thickened cooking liquid over the Tench.
11. Let the dish stand until it is cold.
12. Serve the Co fouce Tench cold.
