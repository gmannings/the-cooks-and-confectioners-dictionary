6. Grate the lemon peel and add it to the bowl.
7. Add currants, raisins, and minced dates to the mixture. Mix well.
8. Add sugar and rose water to the bowl. Mix everything together until well combined.
9. Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F).
10. Roll out the pastry dough and line your pie dishes with it.
11. Fill the pastry cases with the minc'd pie mixture, making sure to distribute it evenly.
12. Cover the pies with pastry lids or decorative pastry shapes.
13. Place the pies in the preheated oven and bake for approximately 30-40 minutes, or until the pastry is golden brown and the filling is cooked through.
