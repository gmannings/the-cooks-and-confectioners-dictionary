# Tofouce Menilon

## Description
Tofouce Menilon is a traditional 18th-century dish made with venison. The venison is boiled in a mixture of water, beer, and vinegar, then seasoned with herbs and spices. It is then pressed and seasoned with salt, pepper, and nutmeg.

## Ingredients:
- 1 kg venison
- 1 liter water
- 500 ml beer
- 250 ml vinegar
- 1 bunch fennel
- 1 bunch rosemary tops
- 1 bunch savory
- 1 bunch thyme
- 4 bay leaves
- Salt, to taste

## Instructions:
1. In a large pot, combine the water, beer, and vinegar. Bring to a boil.
2. Skim off any impurities that rise to the surface.
3. Add the fennel, rosemary tops, savory, thyme, and bay leaves to the pot.
4. Carefully add the venison to the pot and parboil it for about 10 minutes.
5. Remove the venison from the pot and place it on a clean surface.
6. Press the venison with a heavy object, such as a plate or a cutting board, to remove excess moisture.
7. Season the venison with salt, pepper, and nutmeg, rubbing the spices into the meat.
8. Allow the venison to marinate in the spices for at least 1 hour.
9. Preheat the oven to 180Â°C.

11. Remove the venison from the oven and let it rest for a few minutes before slicing.
12. Serve the Tofouce Menilon sliced, with the cooking juices poured over the top.
