# Roasted Boar's Head

## Description
This recipe is for preparing and cooking a boar's head. The head is first cleaned and prepared, then boiled in a flavorful broth for several hours. The head can be served whole or sliced, and is typically served cold.

## Ingredients:
- 1 boar's head
- 1 brick (for cleaning)
- Salt
- Leaf fat of a hog's belly
- 2 bay leaves
- Assorted fine herbs
- Coriander seeds
- Aniseeds
- Nutmeg
- Cloves
- Rosemary
- 1 onion
- 1 quart of good wine

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to a high temperature.
2. Place the boar's head near an open fire to singe off the hair. Use a piece of brick to rub the head and remove any remaining hair.
3. Scrape the head with a knife to clean it thoroughly.
4. Bone the head and remove the two jaw bones and snout.
5. Split the head underneath so that it sticks to the skin on top. Remove the brain and tongue.
6. Sprinkle salt over the entire surface of the head, ensuring it penetrates all parts of the flesh.
7. Reassemble the head and wrap it tightly in a clean napkin. Tie the napkin securely.
8. Place the wrapped head in a large kettle of hot water. Add the leaf fat of a hog's belly, bay leaves, fine herbs, coriander seeds, aniseeds, salt, nutmeg, cloves, rosemary, and an onion to the water.
9. Bring the water to a boil and let the head simmer for half the cooking time, approximately 6 hours.
10. After 6 hours, pour in the quart of good wine and continue boiling for another 6 hours.
11. Once the head is fully cooked, remove it from the cooking liquid and let it cool in its own liquor.
12. Once cooled, remove the head from the napkin and transfer it to a serving dish.
13. Serve the boar's head cold, either whole or sliced.
