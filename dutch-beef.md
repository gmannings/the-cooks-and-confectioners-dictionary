# Dutch Beef

## Description
Dutch Beef is a cured and dried beef dish that originated in the 18th century. It is made by curing a piece of beef with a mixture of sugar, salt, and saltpetre, and then drying it in a chimney. The beef is then boiled until tender before serving.

## Options and commentary
- You can use any boneless beef cut for this recipe, such as rump roast or sirloin.
- Saltpetre, also known as potassium nitrate, is a curing salt that helps preserve the meat and gives it a characteristic flavor. It can be found in specialty stores or online.
- Pump water refers to water from a well or pump, but you can use regular tap water for boiling the beef.

## Ingredients:
- 1 boneless beef roast (approximately 3.5 kg)
- 170 g coarse sugar
- 500 ml white salt
- 30 g saltpetre (potassium nitrate)

## Instructions:
1. Rub the beef roast all over with the coarse sugar. Let it sit for two days.
2. After two days, wipe off any excess sugar from the beef.
3. In a bowl, mix together the white salt and saltpetre.
4. Rub the salt mixture well into the beef, making sure to cover all sides. Let it sit for three weeks, turning and rubbing it every day.
5. After three weeks, remove the beef from the curing mixture and wrap it tightly in a clean cloth.
6. Hang the wrapped beef in a cool, dry place, such as a well-ventilated pantry or cellar. Make sure to hang it upside down to prevent the brine from settling.
7. Allow the beef to dry for several weeks until it becomes firm and dark in color.
8. Once the beef is dried, it is ready to be cooked. Fill a large pot with enough water to fully submerge the beef.
9. Bring the water to a boil and carefully add the dried beef.
10. Reduce the heat to a simmer and cook the beef for approximately 3-4 hours, or until it is very tender.
11. Remove the beef from the pot and let it rest for a few minutes before slicing.
12. Serve the Dutch Beef sliced thinly as a cold meat dish or use it in sandwiches and salads.
