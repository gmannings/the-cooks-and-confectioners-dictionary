# Eggs in Monthine

## Description
Eggs in Monthine is a simple and delicious dish made with fried eggs served with a flavorful onion sauce. The eggs are cooked until the yolks are still slightly runny, and the sauce adds a tangy and savory element to the dish.

## Ingredients:
- 4 eggs
- 2 tablespoons butter
- 2 tablespoons oil
- Salt, to taste
- 1 onion, sliced
- 2 tablespoons verjuice (or substitute with lemon juice)
- Grated nutmeg, to taste

## Instructions:
1. Heat a large non-stick skillet over medium heat and add the butter and oil. Allow them to melt together.
2. Crack the eggs into a dish and carefully slide them into the skillet, making sure to keep the yolks intact. Sprinkle some salt over the eggs.
3. Cook the eggs over medium heat until the whites are set but the yolks are still slightly runny. This should take about 3-4 minutes.
4. While the eggs are cooking, prepare the onion sauce. In a separate skillet, heat some oil or butter over medium heat.
5. Add the sliced onion to the skillet and cook until they are golden brown and caramelized, stirring occasionally. This should take about 8-10 minutes.
6. Once the onions are caramelized, add the verjuice (or lemon juice) to the skillet. Season with salt and grated nutmeg. Cook for an additional 1-2 minutes to allow the flavors to meld together.
7. Remove the eggs from the skillet and transfer them to a serving plate. Spoon the onion sauce over the eggs.
8. Serve the Eggs in Monthine immediately.
