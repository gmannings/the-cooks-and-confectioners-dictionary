# Pickled White Mushrooms

## Description
This recipe is for pickling mushrooms in a white vinegar-based brine. The mushrooms are first boiled in a mixture of milk and water to remove any bitterness, then drained and pickled in a spiced vinegar solution. The pickled mushrooms can be used as a condiment or added to salads and sandwiches for a tangy flavor.

## Ingredients:
- 500g white button mushrooms
- 500ml milk
- 500ml water
- 500ml white wine vinegar
- 1 piece of ginger (about 2cm), sliced
- 1 teaspoon long pepper (or substitute with black peppercorns)
- 1 teaspoon mace
- 1 nutmeg, quartered
- Sweet oil (such as olive oil) for topping
- Leather or airtight container for sealing

## Instructions:
1. Clean the mushrooms by wiping them with a damp cloth or paper towel to remove any dirt or debris.
2. In a large saucepan, combine the milk and water in equal quantities and bring to a boil.
3. Add the mushrooms to the boiling milk and water mixture and cook for about 15 minutes, or until the mushrooms are tender.
4. Drain the mushrooms in a sieve to remove excess liquid and set aside.
5. In a separate saucepan, combine the white wine vinegar, sliced ginger, long pepper, and mace. Bring the mixture to a boil.
6. Add the quartered nutmeg to the boiling vinegar mixture and let it simmer for a few minutes.
7. Remove the vinegar mixture from heat and let it cool completely.
8. Once the vinegar mixture is cooled, add the drained mushrooms to the mixture and stir gently to coat the mushrooms.
9. Transfer the pickled mushrooms to a clean, airtight container.
10. Pour a layer of sweet oil on top of the mushrooms to create a seal.
11. Close the container tightly with a lid or cover it with a piece of leather to ensure a tight seal.
12. Store the pickled mushrooms in a cool, dark place for at least a week before consuming to allow the flavors to develop.
