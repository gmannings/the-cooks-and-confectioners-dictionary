# Fried Pig's Feet

## Description
This recipe is for frying pig's feet. The feet are first boiled and blanched, then fried in butter. The bones can be removed before frying or left in. The fried feet are then seasoned with herbs, spices, and a sauce made with egg yolks, mutton gravy, vinegar, and citrus juice. This dish can be served as a main course or as a side dish.
