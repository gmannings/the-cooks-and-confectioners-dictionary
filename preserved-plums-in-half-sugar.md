# Preserved Plums in Half Sugar

## Description
Preserved Plums in Half Sugar is a sweet and tangy dessert made by boiling plums in a mixture of sugar and water. The plums are then drained and dried in a stove to create a chewy and flavorful treat.

## Ingredients:
- 1 kg plums
- 500 g granulated sugar

## Instructions:
1. Wash the plums thoroughly and remove any stems or leaves.
2. In a large pot, combine the plums and sugar in equal quantities. For example, if you have 1 kg of plums, use 1 kg of sugar.
3. Place the pot on the stove over medium heat and bring the mixture to a boil. Stir occasionally to ensure that the sugar is fully dissolved.
4. Once the mixture is boiling, reduce the heat to low and let the plums simmer for a few minutes. This will help the plums release their juice.
5. Remove the pot from the heat and let the plums sit in the syrup until they have released their juice. This may take several hours or overnight.
6. After the plums have released their juice, return the pot to the stove and bring the mixture to a boil again.
7. Boil the plums until the syrup reaches a "pearled" consistency. This means that the syrup will have thickened and become slightly sticky.
8. Once the syrup has reached the desired consistency, remove the pot from the heat and let the plums cool.
9. Transfer the plums to earthen pans and let them sit overnight to further drain and develop their flavor.
10. The next day, drain the plums from the syrup and arrange them on drying racks or trays.
11. Place the plums in a stove or dehydrator set to a low temperature (around 50Â°C) and dry them until they are chewy and no longer sticky. This may take several hours or even a day, depending on the moisture content of the plums.
12. Once the plums are dried, remove them from the stove and let them cool completely.
13. Store the Preserved Plums in Half Sugar in an airtight container at room temperature for up to several months.
