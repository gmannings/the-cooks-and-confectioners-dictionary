# Farc'd Rib of Beef

## Description
This recipe involves roasting a rib of beef and then stuffing it with a mixture of minced beef, bacon, suet, herbs, and spices. The rib is then sewn back up and served with fricandoes or Scotch collops as a garnish. The dish is traditionally eaten with a spoon, so the skins are removed before serving.

## Options and commentary
- You can use a bone-in or boneless rib of beef for this recipe, depending on your preference.
- Feel free to adjust the herbs and spices to your taste.
- Fricandoes are small pieces of meat, usually veal or chicken, that are braised and served in a sauce. Scotch collops are thin slices of meat, usually beef, that are cooked with onions and served in a sauce. You can choose either option as a garnish.
- The skins are removed before serving to make it easier to eat the meat with a spoon.

## Ingredients:
- 1 rib of beef (approximately 2 kg)
- 200g minced beef
- 100g bacon, finely chopped
- 50g beef suet, finely chopped
- Assorted herbs (such as thyme, rosemary, and parsley), finely chopped
- Salt and pepper, to taste
- Fricandoes or Scotch collops, for garnish
- Fried bread, for garnish

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 180Â°C.
2. Place the rib of beef on a roasting rack in a roasting pan and roast it in the preheated oven until it is almost cooked to your desired level of doneness. This will depend on the size of the rib and your preference, but it usually takes about 1.5 to 2 hours.
3. While the rib is roasting, prepare the stuffing. In a bowl, combine the minced beef, chopped bacon, chopped beef suet, chopped herbs, salt, and pepper. Mix well to combine.
4. When the rib is almost done, remove it from the oven and carefully cut a slit along the length of the rib, between the skin and the bone. Be careful not to cut through the skin completely.
5. Stuff the slit with the prepared stuffing mixture, pressing it in firmly to ensure it fills the space.
6. Sew up the slit using kitchen twine or skewers to secure the stuffing inside the rib.
7. Return the rib to the oven and continue roasting for another 15-20 minutes, or until the stuffing is cooked through and the rib reaches your desired level of doneness.
8. While the rib is finishing cooking, prepare the garnish. If using fricandoes, follow a separate recipe for making them. If using Scotch collops, thinly slice some beef and cook it with onions in a saucepan until browned and cooked through.
9. Remove the rib from the oven and let it rest for a few minutes before serving.
10. To serve, remove the skins from the rib and slice it into individual portions. Garnish the dish with the fricandoes or Scotch collops and fried bread.
11. Enjoy the farc'd rib of beef with a spoon!
