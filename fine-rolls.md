# Fine Rolls

## Description
Fine Rolls are small, soft bread rolls that were popular in the 18th century. They are made with a mixture of flour, eggs, yeast, and milk, resulting in a light and fluffy texture. These rolls can be enjoyed on their own or used as a side for soups, stews, or sandwiches.

## Ingredients:
- 500g fine flour
- 2 egg yolks
- Pinch of salt
- 120ml ale yeast
- Warm milk
- A splash of Canary wine (optional)

## Instructions:
1. In a large mixing bowl, combine the fine flour, egg yolks, salt, and ale yeast. Mix well until all the ingredients are evenly distributed.
2. Gradually add warm milk to the mixture, a little at a time, while kneading the dough. Continue kneading until the dough comes together and becomes smooth.
3. If desired, add a splash of Canary wine to the dough and knead it in.
4. Once the dough is well-molded, place it in a warm cloth and let it rise for about 1-2 hours, or until it has doubled in size.
5. After the dough has risen, punch it down to release any air bubbles and knead it again for a few minutes.
6. Divide the dough into small portions and shape them into rolls. You can make them round or elongated, depending on your preference.
7. Place the rolls on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper, leaving some space between them to allow for expansion.
8. Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F).
9. Let the rolls rise for another 30 minutes to an hour, or until they have puffed up slightly.
10. Bake the rolls in the preheated oven for about 15-20 minutes, or until they are golden brown on top.
11. Remove the rolls from the oven and let them cool on a wire rack.
12. Once the rolls have cooled, you can optionally rafp them (grate the top crust off) to achieve a smoother surface.
13. Place the rafped rolls back in the oven for a few minutes to crisp up the crust slightly.

## Cooking time
Approximately 2-3 hours (including rising and baking time)
