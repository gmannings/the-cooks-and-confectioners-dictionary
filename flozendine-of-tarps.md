# Flozendine of Tarps

## Description
Flozendine of Tarps is a dish made with a pastry crust filled with a seasoned carp, fruits, and spices. The pie is then baked and served hot.

## Options and commentary
- Instead of using a carp, you can use any other firm white fish such as cod or haddock.
- You can add other fruits such as apples or pears to the filling for added sweetness.
- If you prefer a savory pie, you can omit the fruits and add vegetables such as mushrooms and onions.
- The cooking time may vary depending on the size and thickness of the fish.

## Ingredients:
- Pastry:
  - 6 egg yolks
  - 340g butter
  - 500g flour
  - Water (as needed)

- Filling:
  - 1 whole carp (or other firm white fish)
  - Salt and pepper to taste
  - Nutmeg to taste
  - Dates, sliced in halves
  - Barberries
  - Raisins
  - Orange, sliced
  - Lemon, sliced
  - Butter

- Liquor:
  - Butter
  - Claret (red wine)
  - White wine
  - Verjuice (sour juice from unripe fruit)
  - Sugar

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 180Â°C.

2. In a large mixing bowl, combine the egg yolks, butter, and flour. Mix until the ingredients are well incorporated.

3. Gradually add water to the mixture, a little at a time, until the dough comes together and can be formed into a ball. Knead the dough lightly until smooth.

4. Roll out the pastry dough on a floured surface to a thickness of about 1/4 inch.

5. Scale the carp by scraping off the slime. Remove the guts and gall. Season the carp lightly with salt, pepper, and nutmeg.

6. Place the carp in the center of the rolled-out pastry dough. Add the sliced dates, barberries, raisins, orange slices, lemon slices, and small pieces of butter on top of the carp.

7. Fold the pastry dough over the carp, sealing the edges to form a fish-shaped pie. Make sure to crimp the edges to prevent the filling from leaking out during baking.

8. Place the pie on a baking sheet and bake in the preheated oven for approximately 45 minutes to 1 hour, or until the pastry is golden brown and the fish is cooked through.

9. While the pie is baking, prepare the liquor. In a saucepan, melt some butter and add claret, white wine, verjuice, and sugar. Heat the mixture until the sugar has dissolved and the flavors have combined.

10. When the pie is almost baked, remove it from the oven and carefully pour the prepared liquor over the top of the pie.

11. Return the pie to the oven and continue baking for another 10-15 minutes, or until the liquor has reduced slightly and the pie is fully cooked.

12. Once the pie is done, remove it from the oven and let it cool for a few minutes before serving.

13. Optionally, you can ice the pie by drizzling a glaze made of powdered sugar and water over the top to give it a glossy finish.

14. Serve the Flozendine of Tarps hot, either as a main dish or as a part of a larger meal.
