# Ice and Snow

## Description
Ice and Snow is a creamy and frothy dessert made with milk, cream, eggs, and flavored with Canary wine, sugar, and rosewater. It is garnished with preserved barberries and colorful jellies.

## Options and commentary
- Instead of Canary wine, you can use any sweet white wine or a non-alcoholic substitute like grape juice.
- If you don't have barberries, you can substitute with other preserved berries or fruits.
- You can use store-bought jellies of various colors or make your own using gelatin and fruit juice.

## Ingredients:
- 1 liter milk
- 200 ml cream
- 1/4 teaspoon rennet (for cheese making)
- 100 ml Canary wine (or sweet white wine)
- 50 grams sugar
- 3 egg whites
- 1 teaspoon damask rosewater
- Preserved barberries, for garnish
- Assorted jellies, for garnish

## Instructions:
1. In a dish, mix together the milk and cream.
2. Add the rennet to the milk and cream mixture, as if you were making cheese. Stir well to combine.
3. Once the mixture has thickened, pour in the Canary wine and sugar. Stir until the sugar is dissolved.
4. In a separate bowl, whisk the egg whites until they form stiff peaks.
5. Add the damask rosewater to the whipped egg whites and gently fold it in.
6. Using a whisk, whip the milk and cream mixture until it becomes frothy.
7. As the froth rises, carefully spoon it onto the milk and cream mixture in the dish, creating a deep layer of froth.
8. Scatter bunches of preserved barberries on top of the froth.
9. Whip up more froth and spoon it on top of the barberries.
10. Garnish the dish with various colors of jellies, either store-bought or homemade.
