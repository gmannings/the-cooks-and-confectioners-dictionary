# Spanish-Style Fried Sole

## Description
This recipe is a modernized version of a Spanish-style dish featuring fried sole fillets soaked in a flavorful sauce made with Champagne wine, garlic, thyme, and bay leaf. The dish is garnished with your choice of accompaniments.

## Options and commentary
- You can use any white fish fillets instead of sole, such as halibut or cod.
- Feel free to add additional herbs or spices to the sauce, such as paprika or parsley, to suit your taste.
- For garnish, you can use lemon slices, fresh herbs, or even sautéed vegetables.

## Ingredients:
- 4 sole fillets (or any white fish fillets)
- 1 cup Champagne wine (or any dry white wine)
- 2 cloves of garlic, minced
- 1 teaspoon dried thyme
- 1 bay leaf
- Salt and pepper, to taste
- Olive oil, for frying
- Garnish of your choice (lemon slices, fresh herbs, sautéed vegetables, etc.)

## Instructions:
1. In a shallow dish, combine the Champagne wine, minced garlic, dried thyme, bay leaf, salt, and pepper. Mix well to combine the flavors.
2. Place the sole fillets in the dish, ensuring they are fully submerged in the sauce. Allow them to marinate for at least 30 minutes, turning them occasionally to ensure even soaking.
3. Heat a large frying pan over medium heat and add enough olive oil to coat the bottom of the pan.
4. Remove the sole fillets from the marinade, allowing any excess liquid to drip off, and carefully place them in the hot pan. Fry the fillets for about 3-4 minutes on each side, or until they are golden brown and cooked through.
5. Once cooked, transfer the fried sole fillets to a serving platter.
6. Strain the marinade sauce to remove the garlic, thyme, and bay leaf. Pour the strained sauce over the fried sole fillets, ensuring they are well coated.
7. Garnish the dish with your choice of accompaniments, such as lemon slices, fresh herbs, or sautéed vegetables.
8. Serve the Spanish-style fried sole immediately and enjoy!
