## Instructions:
1. Clean the anniseeds by removing any dust and stalks.
2. Heat a pan over medium heat and add the anniseeds.
3. Dry the anniseeds in the pan for a few minutes, stirring occasionally to prevent burning.

5. Once the anniseeds are cool, transfer them to a food processor or blender.
6. Add the sugar to the food processor or blender.
7. Process the anniseeds and sugar together until they form a smooth paste.
8. If the mixture is too dry, you can add a small amount of water or oil to help bind it together.
