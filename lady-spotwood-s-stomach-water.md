# Lady Spotwood's Stomach-water

## Description
Lady Spotwood's Stomach-water is a medicinal drink made from a combination of white wine and various herbs and spices. It was believed to aid digestion and soothe the stomach. This recipe requires steeping the ingredients in wine for several days and then distilling the mixture.

## Ingredients:
- 4 liters of white wine
- 2 handfuls of cowslips (or substitute with chamomile flowers)
- 2 handfuls of rosemary flowers
- 2 handfuls of betony leaves
- 56 grams of cloves
- 56 grams of cinnamon
- 227 grams of mithridate (a medicinal compound, may be difficult to find)

## Instructions:
1. In a large container, combine the white wine, cowslips (or chamomile flowers), rosemary flowers, betony leaves, cloves, and cinnamon.
2. Stir the mixture well to ensure all the ingredients are evenly distributed.
3. Cover the container and let it steep for three days, stirring occasionally.
4. After three days, strain the mixture through a fine-mesh sieve or cheesecloth to remove the herbs and spices.
5. Transfer the strained liquid to an alembic or a still for distillation.
6. Follow the manufacturer's instructions for distilling the liquid. This process will separate the alcohol from the water and concentrate the flavors.
7. Collect the distilled liquid in a clean container.
8. Add the mithridate to the distilled liquid and stir well to combine.
9. Transfer the finished Lady Spotwood's Stomach-water to a bottle or container with a tight-fitting lid for storage.

## Cooking time
- Steeping: 3 days
