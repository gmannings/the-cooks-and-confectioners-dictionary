# Stewed Venison in a Ragout

## Description
This recipe is for a classic 18th-century dish of stewed venison in a flavorful ragout sauce. The venison is larded with bacon and then cooked in a mixture of broth, white wine, and aromatic herbs and spices. The sauce is thickened with flour and finished with a tangy twist of lemon juice and capers.

## Ingredients:
- 1 kg venison (such as deer or elk), cut into large chunks
- 200 g bacon, cut into thick lardons
- Salt and pepper, to taste
- 2 tbsp lard or vegetable oil
- 500 ml broth (beef or game)
- 250 ml white wine
- 1 piece of green lemon (unripe lemon), sliced
- 1 faggot of sweet herbs (such as thyme, rosemary, and parsley)
- 2-3 bay leaves
- 2 tbsp flour
- Juice of 1 lemon
- 2 tbsp capers

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 160Â°C.
2. Using a sharp knife, make deep incisions in the venison and insert the lardons of bacon into the cuts. Season the venison with salt and pepper.
3. Heat the lard or vegetable oil in a large, oven-safe pot or Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Add the larded venison and brown it on all sides until the bacon is crispy and the meat is well-seared. Remove the venison from the pot and set aside.
4. In the same pot, add the broth, white wine, sliced green lemon, faggot of sweet herbs, and bay leaves. Season with salt, nutmeg, and additional pepper if desired. Bring the mixture to a boil.
5. Return the browned venison to the pot, ensuring it is submerged in the liquid. Cover the pot with a lid or foil and transfer it to the preheated oven.
6. Allow the venison to stew in the oven for 3-4 hours, or until it is tender and easily pulls apart with a fork.
7. Once the venison is cooked, remove it from the pot and set it aside. Strain the cooking liquid into a separate bowl, discarding the solids.
8. In a small saucepan, melt the butter over medium heat. Add the flour and cook, stirring constantly, for 2-3 minutes to make a roux.
9. Gradually whisk in the strained cooking liquid, ensuring there are no lumps. Cook the sauce for an additional 5 minutes, or until it thickens to your desired consistency.
10. Return the venison to the pot and pour the thickened sauce over it. Stir in the lemon juice and capers.
11. Place the pot back on the stove over low heat and gently warm the venison and sauce for a few minutes, stirring occasionally.
12. Serve the stewed venison in a ragout hot, accompanied by mashed potatoes, roasted vegetables, or crusty bread.
