# Pot Roasted Hare

## Description
Pot roasted hare is a classic dish from the 18th century. The hare is seasoned with a blend of spices, slow-cooked in a pot with butter, and then pressed into a venison pot. The result is a rich and flavorful meat dish that can be enjoyed on its own or served with a side of vegetables.

## Options and commentary
- You can use a bone-in hare or boneless hare for this recipe. If using bone-in hare, remove the bones after baking and before pounding the meat.
- If you don't have a venison pot, you can use a regular pot or a baking dish.
- Clarified butter is recommended for the final layer, but you can also use regular melted butter.

## Ingredients:
- 1 hare, cut into quarters
- Salt
- Pepper
- Nutmeg
- Cloves

7. Cover the pot or baking dish with a lid or aluminum foil.
8. Bake the hare in the preheated oven for about 2-3 hours, or until the meat is tender and easily falls off the bone.
9. Once the hare is baked, remove it from the pot and let it cool slightly.
10. Remove all the bones from the hare and discard them.
11. Place the hare meat into a mortar and pound it until it becomes a smooth paste.
