# Another Way

## Description
This recipe is for cooking soles in a flavorful sauce made with vinegar, white wine, garlic, herbs, butter, anchovies, nutmeg, and orange. The soles are first marinated in vinegar and salt, then boiled in a mixture of white wine, garlic, and herbs. The cooked soles are then served with a sauce made from butter and minced anchovies, flavored with nutmeg and orange.

## Ingredients:
- 2 soles
- Vinegar
- Salt
- 200 ml white wine
- 6 cloves of garlic
- A bunch of fresh herbs (such as parsley, thyme, and bay leaves)
- 100 g butter
- 4 anchovy fillets, minced
- Grated nutmeg
- 1 orange, minced

## Instructions:
1. Clean the soles by removing the scales and guts. Rinse them under cold water.
2. Using a knife, fillet the soles by cutting along one side of the backbone. Lay the fillets in a dish.
3. Pour enough vinegar over the fillets to cover them, and sprinkle with salt. Let them marinate for half an hour.
4. In the meantime, fill a pot with water and add the white wine, cloves of garlic, and the bunch of fresh herbs. Bring the mixture to a boil.
5. Once the liquid is boiling, carefully place the marinated soles into the pot. Pour in the vinegar and salt mixture that the soles were marinating in.
6. Boil the soles for about 5-7 minutes, or until they are cooked through. To check if they are done, insert a fork into the thickest part of the fillet - it should flake easily.
7. Remove the cooked soles from the pot and drain them well.
8. In a separate bowl, beat the butter until it is thick and creamy. Add the minced anchovies and mix well to dissolve them into the butter.
9. Place the cooked soles on a serving dish and pour the butter and anchovy sauce over them.
10. Sprinkle a little grated nutmeg and minced orange over the top of the dish.
11. Serve the soles with the flavorful sauce.
