# Fricassee Duckling

## Description
Fricassee Duckling is a classic dish that involves cutting the duckling into small pieces, coating them in flour, and frying them in butter. The fried duckling is then served with a sauce made from canary wine, parsley, onion, pepper, mace, sugar, butter, and verjuice. The dish is garnished with fried clary leaves and served with a batter made from eggs, flour, cream, and nutmeg.

## Options and commentary
- Instead of canary wine, you can use white wine or dry white vermouth as a substitute.
- If you can't find clary leaves, you can use parsley or another herb for garnish.
- The batter can be made with milk instead of cream for a lighter option.

## Ingredients:
- 1 duckling, cut into small pieces
- Flour, for coating
- Butter, for frying
- 1/2 cup canary wine (or white wine)
- 1/4 cup chopped parsley
- 1 small onion, chopped
- 1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
- 1 blade of mace
- 1 tablespoon sugar
- 2 tablespoons butter
- 2 tablespoons verjuice (or lemon juice)
- 1 handful of clary leaves (or parsley), stalks removed
- 3-4 eggs
- 1/2 cup flour
- 1/2 cup cream
- 1/4 teaspoon nutmeg

## Instructions:
1. Dry the duckling pieces with paper towels.
2. Coat the duckling pieces in flour, shaking off any excess.
3. Heat a large skillet over medium heat and melt enough butter to cover the bottom of the skillet.
4. Fry the coated duckling pieces in the melted butter until golden brown and cooked through. Remove from the skillet and set aside.
5. In the same skillet, add the canary wine, chopped parsley, chopped onion, ground black pepper, mace, sugar, butter, and verjuice. Cook over medium heat until the sauce thickens slightly.
6. In a separate skillet, heat some butter and fry the clary leaves until crispy. Remove from the skillet and set aside.
7. In a mixing bowl, whisk together the eggs, flour, cream, and nutmeg to make a batter.
8. Heat a small amount of butter in a frying pan and pour a small amount of the batter into the pan to make a thin pancake. Repeat until all the batter is used.
9. Arrange the fried duckling pieces on a serving dish.
10. Pour the sauce over the duckling pieces.
11. Garnish with the fried clary leaves.
12. Serve the fricassee duckling with the fried batter pancakes on the side.
