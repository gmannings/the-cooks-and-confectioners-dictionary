# Medlar Preserve

## Description
Medlar preserve is a sweet and tangy fruit preserve made from ripe medlars and sugar. It is a delicious spread that can be enjoyed on toast, scones, or used as a filling for pastries.

## Ingredients:
- Ripe medlars
- Fine sugar

## Instructions:
1. Wash the medlars thoroughly to remove any dirt or debris.
2. Place the medlars in a large pot and cover them with boiling water. Let them sit for a few minutes until the skin becomes soft and easy to peel.
3. Carefully remove the skin from the medlars, ensuring that you don't damage the flesh.
4. Cut off the head of each medlar and remove the stones.
5. Weigh the peeled and deseeded medlars and measure an equal amount of fine sugar.
6. Place the medlars and sugar in a large pot and set it over medium heat.
7. Stir the mixture continuously until the sugar has dissolved completely.
8. Increase the heat to high and bring the mixture to a boil.
9. Reduce the heat to low and let the mixture simmer until it becomes thick and syrupy, stirring occasionally. This may take about 1-2 hours.
10. Once the preserve has reached the desired consistency (ropy), remove it from the heat.
11. Carefully transfer the hot preserve into clean, sterilized jars.
12. Seal the jars tightly and let them cool completely before storing them in a cool, dark place.

## Cooking time
Approximately 1-2 hours.
