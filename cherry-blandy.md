# Cherry Blandy

## Description
Cherry Blandy is a sweet and aromatic cherry-infused brandy. It is a flavorful and versatile drink that can be enjoyed on its own or used as a base for cocktails.

## Ingredients:
- 1 liter of good brandy
- 1 kg of black cherries
- 7 grams of cloves
- 7 grams of whole mace
- a handful of spearmint leaves
- a handful of balm leaves
- 2 handfuls of clove-gilliflowers (clove-scented pink flowers)
- Sugar, to taste

## Instructions:
1. In a large container, combine the brandy, black cherries, cloves, whole mace, spearmint leaves, balm leaves, and clove-gilliflowers.
2. Stir the mixture well to ensure all the ingredients are evenly distributed.
3. Cover the container and let it steep for 24 hours at room temperature.
4. After 24 hours, gently break the cherries between your hands to release their juices and flavors.
5. Transfer the mixture to a saucepan and place it over low heat.
6. Heat the mixture for a short while, just until it is warmed through. Do not let it boil.
7. Sweeten the mixture with sugar according to your taste preferences. Start with a small amount and gradually add more if desired.
8. Stir the mixture until the sugar has dissolved completely.
9. Remove the saucepan from the heat and let the mixture cool to room temperature.
10. Once cooled, strain the mixture through a fine-mesh sieve or cheesecloth to remove any solids.
11. Transfer the Cherry Blandy to a clean bottle or jar for storage.
12. Store the Cherry Blandy in a cool, dark place for at least a week to allow the flavors to meld together.
13. After a week, the Cherry Blandy is ready to be enjoyed. Serve it chilled or use it as a base for cocktails.
