# Palty of Calves Brains

## Description
This recipe is for a palty (a type of pie) made with calves brains. The brains are first cleaned and blanched, then combined with blanched asparagus, hard-boiled egg yolks, and forcemeat (a mixture of ground meat and other ingredients). The mixture is then baked in the oven and served with a sauce made from lemon juice, drawn butter, and gravy.

## Ingredients:
- 2 calves brains
- 1 bunch of asparagus
- Butter
- Parsley
- 6 hard-boiled eggs (yolks only)
- Forcemeat (see Letter F for directions)
- Juice of 1 lemon
- Drawn butter
- Gravy

## Instructions:
1. Clean the calves brains by removing any excess membranes or blood vessels. Rinse them well under cold water.
2. Bring a pot of water to a boil and add the calves brains. Let them boil for a few minutes to scald them.
3. Remove the calves brains from the boiling water and immediately transfer them to a bowl of ice water to blanch them and stop the cooking process. Let them cool completely.
4. Blanch the tops of the asparagus by placing them in a saucepan with a little butter and parsley. Cook until the asparagus is tender. Remove from heat and let it cool.
5. Once the asparagus is cold, combine it with the blanched calves brains in a mixing bowl.
6. Add the yolks of half a dozen hard-boiled eggs to the mixing bowl.
7. Prepare the forcemeat according to the directions in Letter F.
8. Add the prepared forcemeat to the mixing bowl and mix all the ingredients together until well combined.
9. Preheat the oven to the specified temperature.
10. Transfer the mixture to a pie dish or individual pie dishes to make individual palties.
11. Place the palties in the preheated oven and bake until they are cooked through and golden brown on top.
12. Remove the palties from the oven and squeeze the juice of a lemon over them.
13. Pour drawn butter and gravy over the palties.
14. Serve the palties hot.
