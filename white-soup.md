# White Soup

## Description
White Soup is a hearty and flavorful soup made with a combination of beef and mutton. It is thickened with oatmeal and seasoned with salt and white pepper. The soup is then filled with a variety of vegetables and herbs, giving it a rich and satisfying taste. It is traditionally served with toasted bread and grated cheese on top.

## Options and commentary
- Instead of using neck or ordinary beef, you can use beef stew meat or beef chuck roast.
- If you prefer a leaner option, you can use boneless skinless chicken breasts instead of mutton.
- Feel free to add other vegetables of your choice, such as carrots or celery, to enhance the flavor.
- You can use vegetable broth instead of water for a vegetarian version of the soup.
- The soup can be served as a main course or as a starter for a larger meal.

## Ingredients:
- 500g beef stew meat or beef chuck roast
- 500g boneless skinless chicken breasts (optional)
- 2 liters water or vegetable broth
- 4 tablespoons oatmeal
- Salt, to taste
- White pepper, to taste
- 200g bacon, cut into pieces
- 1 turnip, sliced
- 1 parsnip, sliced
- 2 handfuls of shredded soup herbs (cabbage, savoys, leeks, hard lettuce, white beets, sorrel)
- 1 penny loaf, sliced
- 5-6 egg yolks
- Toasted bread, for garnish
- Grated cheese, for garnish

## Instructions:
1. In a large pot, bring the water or vegetable broth to a boil.
2. Add the beef stew meat and chicken breasts (if using) to the pot. Boil them slowly for about 2 hours, skimming off any impurities that rise to the surface.
3. After the meat has boiled for a while, remove it from the pot and place it in a wooden bowl or tray. Reserve a little bit of the broth.
4. Mash the meat well using a rolling pin, then return it to the pot.
5. Cut off a small piece from each piece of meat and set it aside to use as a garnish later.
6. Add the oatmeal to the pot and stir well. Season with salt and white pepper.
7. Add the bacon pieces, turnip slices, parsnip slices, and shredded soup herbs to the pot. Stir to combine.
8. Cook the soup for another hour, or until the vegetables are tender.
9. While the soup is cooking, preheat your oven to 180°C (350°F).
10. Once the soup is cooked, transfer the pieces of meat to a soup dish.
11. Pour the soup over the meat in the dish and place it in the preheated oven for about an hour.
12. In a separate bowl, beat the egg yolks with a little bit of the soup broth.
13. Remove the soup dish from the oven and stir in the beaten egg yolks.
14. Garnish the soup with toasted bread slices and grated cheese around the edges.
