# Clear Plum Cakes

## Description
Clear Plum Cakes are a type of sweet treat made from plums. The plums are cooked and strained to create a plum liquor, which is then mixed with sugar and boiled to create a candy-like mixture. This mixture is then formed into cakes and dried in a warm environment for a few weeks until they become clear and dry.

## Ingredients:
- Plums
- Sugar

## Instructions:
1. Stone the plums and place them in a jug.
2. Place the jug in a kettle of boiling water and allow the plums to dissolve.
3. Once the plums have dissolved, strain the mixture through a cloth to remove any solids.
4. Measure the plum liquor and for every pint, add a pound of sugar that has been boiled to a candy height.
5. Stir the plum liquor and sugar together and let them boil for a little while.
6. Remove the mixture from heat and allow it to cool slightly.
7. Take small portions of the mixture and shape them into cakes.
8. Place the cakes into glass containers.
9. Set the containers in a moderately hot stove or oven.
10. Let the cakes stand for a fortnight (two weeks) or three weeks without being cooled.
11. During this time, move the containers from one warm place to another and turn the cakes daily to ensure even drying.
12. After the drying period, the cakes should be clear and thoroughly dry.

## Cooking time
Approximately 2-3 weeks for drying the cakes.
