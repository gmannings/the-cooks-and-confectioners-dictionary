# Stewed Eels with Oysters and Anchovies

## Description
This recipe is for a classic 18th-century dish of stewed eels. The eels are minced and seasoned with cloves, mace, onion, white wine, stewing oysters, and anchovies. The stew is then served on sippets (small pieces of toasted bread) and garnished with slices of orange.

## Options and commentary
- Eels: Eels can be difficult to find in some areas. If eels are not available, you can substitute with another firm-fleshed fish such as cod or haddock.
- Stewing oysters: If stewing oysters are not available, you can use regular oysters or omit them altogether.
- Anchovies: If you don't have anchovies, you can use anchovy paste or fish sauce as a substitute.
- Sippets: Sippets are small pieces of toasted bread. You can use baguette slices or any other crusty bread for this.

## Ingredients:
- 2 large eels (or substitute with another firm-fleshed fish)
- 4 cloves
- 1/2 teaspoon ground mace
- 1 onion, quartered
- 1/4 cup white wine
- 1/4 cup stewing oysters (optional)
- 2 anchovies (or substitute with anchovy paste or fish sauce)
- Slices of orange, for garnish
- Sippets (small pieces of toasted bread)

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F).
2. Prepare the eels by drawing (removing the innards), washing, and boning them. Cut the eels into small pieces or mince them.
3. In a stewing pot or a deep skillet, place the minced eels.
4. Add the cloves, ground mace, and quartered onion to the pot.
5. Pour in the white wine and add the stewing oysters (if using) and anchovies.
6. Place the pot over a gentle fire or low heat on the stovetop.
7. Allow the eels to stew for about 20-30 minutes, or until they are cooked through and tender.
8. While the eels are stewing, prepare the sippets by toasting small pieces of bread until they are crispy.
9. Once the eels are cooked, remove them from the heat.
10. Serve the stewed eels on the sippets, garnished with slices of orange.
