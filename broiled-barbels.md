# Broiled Barbels

## Description
This recipe is for broiled barbels, a type of fish. The fish is scaled and cleaned, then seasoned with melted butter and salt before being broiled on a grill. The dish is served with a sauce made from butter, pepper, salt, nutmeg, capers, anchovies, chives, flour, water, and vinegar. This sauce is thickened and poured over the broiled fish. The same sauce and garnish can also be used for a roasted pike.

## Ingredients:
- 2 barbels (or any other firm-fleshed fish)
- 2 tablespoons melted butter
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 1 tablespoon butter
- 1/2 teaspoon pepper
- 1/2 teaspoon nutmeg
- 1 tablespoon capers
- 2 anchovies, finely chopped
- 1 tablespoon chives, finely chopped
- 1 tablespoon flour
- 1/4 cup water
- 1 tablespoon vinegar

## Instructions:
1. Scale and clean the barbels (or other fish). Make small incisions on the sides of the fish.
2. Rub the melted butter over the fish and sprinkle with salt.
3. Preheat the grill or broiler.
4. Place the fish on a grill or broiler pan and cook for about 5-7 minutes on each side, or until the fish is cooked through and has a nice char.
5. While the fish is cooking, prepare the sauce. In a saucepan, melt the butter over medium heat.
6. Add the pepper, nutmeg, capers, anchovies, and chives to the saucepan. Cook for 2-3 minutes, stirring occasionally.
7. Sprinkle the flour over the mixture and stir well to combine.
8. Gradually add the water and vinegar to the saucepan, stirring constantly to prevent lumps from forming.
9. Continue cooking the sauce, stirring constantly, until it thickens to your desired consistency.
10. Once the fish is cooked, remove it from the grill or broiler and transfer to a serving platter.
11. Pour the prepared sauce over the fish, ensuring it is evenly coated.
12. Serve the broiled barbels with the sauce and garnish with additional chives, if desired.
