# Baked Red Deer

## Description
This recipe is for baking red deer, a type of venison. The red deer is seasoned, larded, and baked in a pie crust. The meat is flavored with a mixture of salt, pepper, and nutmeg, and the pie is filled with butter. The crust is made with rye meal and is baked until golden brown. This dish is rich and flavorful, perfect for a special occasion.

## Options and commentary
- You can use other types of venison or game meat instead of red deer if desired.
- If you prefer a lighter seasoning, you can reduce the amount of salt, pepper, and nutmeg.
- Instead of using a pie crust, you can wrap the seasoned meat in puff pastry for a different presentation.
- If you want to serve the dish hot, you can reduce the baking time to about 4-5 hours.

## Ingredients:
- 1 side or half a haunch of red deer (or other venison)

2. Bone the side or half a haunch of red deer and season it with salt, pepper, and nutmeg.
3. Remove the back sinews and the skin from the meat.
4. Lard the fillet or back of the red deer with large lard pieces, about the size of your middle finger, seasoned with pepper and nutmeg.
5. In a bowl, mix 6 ounces of salt, 4 ounces of pepper, and 4 ounces of nutmeg.
6. Flash the seasoned red deer on the outside to make the seasoning penetrate the meat.
7. Season the red deer well with the salt, pepper, and nutmeg mixture.

15. Once the pie is baked and cold, fill it up with clarified butter.
16. To make the crust, take 500g of rye meal and coarsely sieve it.
17. Make the rye meal stiff by adding boiling water gradually until the dough comes together.
18. Roll out the dough and use it to cover the pie dish, sealing the edges.
