# Fried Pike Fillets

## Description
This recipe is for frying pike fillets, a classic dish from the 18th century. The pike fillets are marinated, dipped in a thin batter, and then fried until crispy. They are served with slices of lemon and parsley for garnish. Alternatively, you can serve the fried fillets with a white sauce made from bread crumbs and fish broth, with a squeeze of lemon juice for added flavor.

## Options and commentary
- You can use any white fish fillets as a substitute for pike.
- If you prefer a lighter coating, you can use a tempura batter instead of a traditional batter.
- The white sauce can be made with breadcrumbs or flour, depending on your preference.
- Adjust the amount of lemon juice according to your taste.

## Ingredients:
- 1 pike, gutted and scaled
- Marinade (see Recipe No. 143)
- Thin batter or tempura batter
- Slices of lemon, for garnish
- Parsley, for garnish
- White sauce:
  - Crumb of bread, pounded and strained through a sieve
  - Fish broth or fish stock
  - Lemon juice

## Instructions:
1. Gut and scale the pike, then cut it into slices or fillets.
2. Prepare the marinade according to Recipe No. 143, but marinate the pike fillets for only half an hour.
3. Heat oil in a deep frying pan or skillet.
4. Dip each pike fillet into the thin batter or tempura batter, ensuring it is evenly coated.
5. Carefully place the coated fillets into the hot oil and fry until they are golden brown and crispy on both sides. This should take about 3-4 minutes per side, depending on the thickness of the fillets.
6. Remove the fried fillets from the oil and drain them on a paper towel to remove excess oil.
7. Dish the fried fillets and garnish with slices of lemon and parsley.
8. Alternatively, you can make a white sauce by pounding the crumb of bread and straining it through a sieve. In a stew-pan, heat the bread crumbs with a little fish broth or fish stock, and simmer for a few minutes. The sauce should thicken slightly. When serving, squeeze in some lemon juice for added flavor.
9. Serve the fried pike fillets with the white sauce on the side or drizzled over the fillets.
