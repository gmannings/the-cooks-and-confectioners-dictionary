# Baked Brawn Pie

## Description
This recipe is for a traditional 18th-century dish called Brawn, which is made from minced lean pork and bacon. The mixture is seasoned with sage, salt, pepper, and ginger, then mixed with egg yolks and vinegar. The brawn mixture is then encased in a pastry crust, topped with butter and bay leaves, and baked until golden brown. The resulting pie is served cold and makes for a delicious and hearty meal.

## Ingredients:
- 500g lean pork
- 200g bacon
- 1 handful of sage leaves
- Salt, to taste
- Pepper, to taste
- Ginger, to taste

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F).

5. In a separate bowl, whisk together the egg yolks and vinegar.
6. Add the egg yolk mixture to the minced pork and bacon mixture, mixing well to combine.
7. Roll out the pastry crust and line a pie dish with it.

9. Place small pieces of butter and bay leaves on top of the brawn mixture.
10. Cover the pie with another layer of pastry, sealing the edges.

14. Once cooled, refrigerate the pie for at least a few hours or overnight to allow it to set.
