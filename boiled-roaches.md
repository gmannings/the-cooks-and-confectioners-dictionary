# Boiled Roaches

## Description
Boiled Roaches is a traditional 18th-century dish made with fish. The fish, known as roaches, are scotched and then boiled in a flavorful mixture of beer, vinegar, water, and white wine. The dish is seasoned with herbs and horseradish for added flavor.

## Ingredients:
- 4 roaches (or any small fish of your choice)
- 500 ml stale beer
- 250 ml vinegar
- 250 ml water
- 100 ml white wine
- 1 handful of salt
- 1 bunch of rosemary
- 1 bunch of winter savory
- 1 bunch of thyme
- 1 bunch of parsley
- 1 handful of sliced horseradish root

## Instructions:
1. Scale the roaches and remove the innards. Rinse them well under cold water.
2. Pat the roaches dry with a clean cloth.
3. Make three or four shallow cuts on one side of each roach, cutting down to the bone.
4. In a stew-pan, combine the stale beer, vinegar, water, and white wine. The liquid should be enough to cover the fish.
5. Add a handful of salt, the bunches of rosemary, winter savory, thyme, and parsley, and the sliced horseradish root to the stew-pan.
6. Place the stew-pan over a high heat on a wooden fire and bring the liquid to a boil.
7. Boil the liquid until it reduces to a desired height, intensifying the flavors.
8. Gently place the scotched roaches into the boiling liquid.
9. Reduce the heat to a simmer and cook the roaches for about 10-15 minutes, or until they are cooked through and tender.
10. Carefully remove the roaches from the liquid and transfer them to a serving dish.
11. Serve the boiled roaches hot, accompanied by the flavorful cooking liquid as a sauce.
