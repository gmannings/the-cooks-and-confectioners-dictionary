# Duck Pie

## Description
This recipe is for a traditional 18th century dish called Duck Pye. It involves preparing ducks for roasting, larding them with bacon and ham, and then baking them in a pie crust. The pie is filled with a mixture of seasoned bacon, duck, and mutton cutlets, and topped with veal and bacon slices. While the pie is baking, a ragout of mushrooms, truffles, cockscombs, livers, and sweetbreads is prepared and served with the pie.

## Options and commentary
- Instead of larding the ducks, you can use bacon strips to wrap around them.
- You can use store-bought pie crust or make your own.
- The ragout can be customized with your choice of mushrooms and other ingredients.
- Serve the pie with a side of vegetables or a salad.

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F).
2. Prepare the ducks for roasting by cleaning and removing any excess fat or giblets.
3. Parboil the ducks by placing them in a pot of boiling water for a few minutes. This will help remove any gamey flavors.
4. Lard the ducks by inserting bacon strips or lardons into the meat. You can do this by making small incisions and pushing the bacon in.
5. Season the ducks with pepper, salt, spices, and a mixture of finely chopped fresh herbs (parsley, chives, etc.).
6. Roll out the pie crust to about 1 inch thick and use it to line a pie dish.
7. Spread a layer of pounded bacon on the bottom of the pie crust, seasoned with salt, pepper, spices, herbs, and chives.
8. Place the ducks in the pie crust, filling any empty spaces with seasoned and larded mutton cutlets.
9. Sprinkle more of the seasoning mixture over the ducks and cutlets.
10. Lay thin slices of veal over the ducks and cutlets, followed by thin slices of bacon.
11. Add a piece of butter on top.
12. Cover the pie with the remaining pie crust, sealing the edges well.
13. Place the pie in the preheated oven and let it bake for 4-5 hours.
14. While the pie is baking, prepare the ragout by sautéing mushrooms, truffles, cockscombs, livers, and sweetbreads in melted bacon fat.
15. Moisten the mixture with gravy and let it simmer over low heat for about 30 minutes.
16. Skim off any fat that rises to the surface and thicken the ragout with a cullis made from veal and ham stock.
17. Once the pie is done baking, remove it from the oven and let it cool slightly.
18. Cut open the pie and remove the bacon and veal slices.
19. Skim off any excess fat from the top of the pie.
20. Pour the prepared ragout into the pie.
21. Serve the duck pie hot as the first course of a meal.
