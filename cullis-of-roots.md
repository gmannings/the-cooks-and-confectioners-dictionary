# Cullis of Roots

## Description
Cullis of Roots is a thick, flavorful sauce made from a mixture of parsnips, carrots, parsley roots, onions, blanched almonds, and soaked French rolls. It is commonly used as a base for soups or as a sauce for vegetables like cardoons, charvil, onions, and leeks.

## Ingredients:
- 2 parsnips
- 2 carrots
- 2 parsley roots
- 1 onion
- 18 blanched almonds
- 2 French rolls
- Fish broth
- Salt and pepper to taste

## Instructions:
1. Peel and slice the parsnips, carrots, parsley roots, and onion.
2. In a stew-pan, toss the sliced vegetables together.
3. In a mortar, pound the blanched almonds and the crumb of the French rolls soaked in fish broth until they form a paste.
4. Add the pounded almonds and bread paste to the stew-pan with the vegetables.
5. Pour enough fish broth into the stew-pan to cover the vegetables and almond mixture.
6. Season the mixture with salt and pepper.
7. Bring the mixture to a boil and then reduce the heat to a simmer.
8. Cook the mixture until the vegetables are tender and the flavors have melded together, stirring occasionally.
9. Once cooked, strain the mixture through a fine-mesh sieve to remove any solids.
10. The resulting liquid is the cullis of roots, which can be used as a base for soups or as a sauce for vegetables.

## Cooking time
Approximately 30-40 minutes, depending on the size and thickness of the vegetable slices.
