# Roasted Red Deer

## Description
This recipe is for roasting a side or haunch of red deer. The meat can be larded with small pieces of fat or stuck with cloves before roasting. It is then served with a choice of sauces.

## Options and commentary
- You can use either a side or haunch of red deer for this recipe.
- Larding the meat with small pieces of fat helps to keep it moist during roasting.
- If you don't have larding fat, you can stick the meat with cloves for added flavor.
- The choice of sauce is up to you and can be based on personal preference.

## Ingredients:
- 1 side or haunch of red deer
- Larding fat or cloves (optional)
- Sauce of your choice (e.g., red wine sauce, cranberry sauce, etc.)

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F).
2. If larding the meat, parboil the larding fat by placing it in a pot of boiling water for a few minutes. This will help to render some of the fat and make it easier to work with.
3. If using cloves, stick them into the meat at regular intervals.
4. If larding the meat, cut small slits into the meat and insert the larding fat pieces.
5. Place the red deer meat on a roasting spit or rack, ensuring it is securely fastened.
6. Place the meat in the preheated oven and roast for approximately 20 minutes per pound (45 minutes per kilogram) for medium-rare doneness. Adjust the cooking time based on your desired level of doneness.
7. While the meat is roasting, prepare the sauce of your choice according to its specific recipe.
8. Once the meat is cooked to your liking, remove it from the oven and let it rest for 10-15 minutes before carving.
9. Carve the roasted red deer into thin slices and serve with the sauce of your choice.

## Cooking time
Approximately 20 minutes per pound (45 minutes per kilogram) for medium-rare doneness. Adjust cooking time based on desired level of doneness.
