# Ambergreele Cakes

## Description
Ambergreele Cakes are delicate, sweet cakes flavored with ambergris, civet, and aniseeds. They have a light and airy texture and are perfect for a sweet treat.

## Ingredients:
- 200g fine sugar
- 6 eggs
- Ambergris (modern alternative: vanilla extract)
- Civet (modern alternative: musk essence)
- Aniseeds (modern alternative: anise extract)
- Butter, for greasing plates

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 180Â°C.
2. In a mixing bowl, beat the fine sugar until it is fine and powdery.
3. In a separate bowl, beat the eggs until they form a froth.
4. As the froth rises, carefully remove it from the top and add it to the powdered sugar.
5. Using a marble mortar and pestle, grind the sugar and egg mixture together until it is thoroughly moistened and thin enough to drop on plates.
6. Add a few drops of ambergris (or vanilla extract), civet (or musk essence), and aniseeds (or anise extract) to the batter. Mix well.
7. Grease the plates with butter to prevent sticking.
8. Drop the batter onto the plates in the form of round cakes.
9. Bake the cakes in a gentle oven for approximately 15-20 minutes, or until they become hard and rise slightly.
10. Remove the cakes from the oven and let them cool before serving.

## Cooking time
Approximately 15-20 minutes.
