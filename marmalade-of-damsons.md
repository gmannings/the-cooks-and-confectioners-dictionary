# Marmalade of Damsons

## Description
This recipe is for making a delicious marmalade using ripe damsons. Damsons are a type of small, tart plum that are perfect for making preserves. The marmalade is sweetened with sugar and has a rich, fruity flavor.

## Options and commentary
- You can adjust the amount of sugar used according to your taste preference. If you prefer a sweeter marmalade, you can add more sugar.
- You can also add spices such as cinnamon or cloves to enhance the flavor of the marmalade.

## Ingredients:
- 4 liters of ripe damsons
- Sugar (equal weight to the damsons)

## Instructions:
1. Wash the damsons and remove any stems or leaves.
2. Peel the skins off three-quarters of the damsons. Place the unskinned damsons in the bottom of an earthen pan, and then place the skinned damsons on top.
3. Cover the pan tightly to prevent any water from getting in.
4. Fill a kettle with water and place the pan of damsons in it.
5. Boil the damsons until they are tender.
6. Remove the stones from the damsons, as well as the skins and stones from the bottom layer.
7. Weigh the damsons and add an equal weight of sugar to the pan.
8. Place the pan on the stove and bring the mixture to a rapid boil, stirring occasionally.
9. Skim off any foam that forms on the surface of the marmalade.
10. Cook the marmalade until it reaches the desired consistency. This can take around 30-45 minutes, depending on the desired thickness.
11. Once the marmalade is cooked, transfer it to sterilized jars and seal them tightly.
