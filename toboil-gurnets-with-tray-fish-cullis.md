# Toboil Gurnets with Tray-fish Cullis

## Description
This recipe is a variation of the traditional method of boiling fish, using gurnets (a type of fish) and a sauce made from crayfish. The dish is cooked by boiling the fish and then serving it with a flavorful crayfish sauce.

## Options and commentary
- Gurnets: Gurnets are a type of fish that are not commonly found in modern markets. A suitable alternative would be red snapper or sea bass.
- Tray-fish Cullis: Cullis is a type of sauce made from fish stock. In this recipe, it is flavored with crayfish. If crayfish is not available, you can use shrimp or lobster to make the sauce.

## Ingredients:
- 2 gurnets (or red snapper/sea bass fillets)
- 500ml fish stock
- 200g crayfish (or shrimp/lobster)
- Salt and pepper to taste

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 180Â°C.
2. In a large pot, bring the fish stock to a boil.
3. Add the gurnets (or red snapper/sea bass fillets) to the pot and cook for about 10 minutes, or until the fish is cooked through.
4. While the fish is cooking, prepare the crayfish cullis. In a separate pot, bring the crayfish (or shrimp/lobster) to a boil and cook for about 5 minutes.
5. Remove the crayfish (or shrimp/lobster) from the pot and let them cool slightly. Peel the shells and set aside the meat.
6. In a blender or food processor, blend the crayfish (or shrimp/lobster) meat until smooth.
7. Strain the fish stock from the pot into a clean pot, discarding any solids.
8. Add the crayfish (or shrimp/lobster) puree to the fish stock and bring to a simmer. Cook for about 5 minutes, or until the sauce has thickened slightly.
9. Season the sauce with salt and pepper to taste.
10. Remove the gurnets (or red snapper/sea bass fillets) from the pot and place them on a serving dish.
11. Pour the crayfish cullis over the fish.
12. Serve hot.
