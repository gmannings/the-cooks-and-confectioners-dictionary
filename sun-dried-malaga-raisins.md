# Sun-Dried Malaga Raisins

## Description
This recipe is a modern adaptation of an 18th-century method for sun-drying Malaga raisins. The raisins are soaked in spring water and left in the sun for several months until they are dried and ready to use.

## Ingredients:
- 3 pounds (1.4 kg) Malaga raisins
- Spring water

## Instructions:
1. Place the Malaga raisins in a large vessel.
2. Pour enough spring water into the vessel to cover the raisins completely.
3. Stir the raisins and water gently to ensure they are well-mixed.
4. Cover the vessel with a clean cloth or plastic wrap to keep out insects and debris.
5. Place the vessel in a sunny location, such as a windowsill or outdoor area.
6. Leave the raisins in the sun for four months, or until they are completely dried. Check on them occasionally to ensure they are drying properly and to remove any moldy or spoiled raisins.
7. Once the raisins are dried and shriveled, they are ready to use in your favorite recipes.
