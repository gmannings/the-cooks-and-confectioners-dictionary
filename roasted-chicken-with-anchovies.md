# Roasted Chicken with Anchovies

## Description
This recipe involves roasting chickens that are stuffed with a flavorful mixture of grated bacon, anchovies, herbs, and spices. The roasted chickens are then served with a sauce made from melted anchovies and a veal and ham broth.

## Ingredients:
- 2 whole chickens
- 100g bacon, grated
- 2 anchovies, minced
- 2 tablespoons chives, finely chopped
- 2 tablespoons parsley, finely chopped
- Salt and pepper, to taste
- 500ml veal and ham broth

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 180°C.
2. Raise the skin from the breasts of the chickens by gently separating it from the meat with your fingers.
3. In a bowl, mix together the grated bacon, minced anchovies, chives, parsley, salt, and pepper.
4. Stuff the chicken breasts with the bacon mixture, making sure to evenly distribute it.
