# Clove-Water

## Description
Clove-Water is a flavored water made with cloves and cinnamon. It was commonly used in the 18th century as a refreshing beverage or as a base for other drinks.

## Ingredients:
- 10 cloves
- 1 cinnamon stick
- 1 liter of water
- 1 tablespoon of sugar

## Instructions:
1. In a small bowl, mix the cloves and cinnamon together. This will help distribute the flavors evenly.
2. In a saucepan, bring the water to a simmer.
3. Add the cloves, cinnamon, and sugar to the simmering water.
4. Let the mixture infuse over low heat for about 15 minutes. This will allow the flavors to meld together.
5. Remove the saucepan from the heat and let it cool for a few minutes.
6. Strain the mixture through a fine-mesh sieve or cheesecloth to remove the cloves and cinnamon.
7. Transfer the clove-water to a clean container and let it cool completely.
8. Once cooled, the clove-water is ready to be used.
