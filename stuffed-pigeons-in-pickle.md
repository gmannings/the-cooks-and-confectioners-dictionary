# Stuffed Pigeons in Pickle

## Description
This recipe is for a dish called "Another Way" which involves stuffing pigeons with a flavorful mixture and then preserving them in a pickle. The pigeons are first deboned and the flesh is minced and seasoned with salt, pepper, spices, herbs, marrow, hard-boiled egg yolks, anchovies, and lemon peel. The mixture is then used to stuff the boiled pigeons. The pickling liquid is made with water, white wine, salt, and bay leaves. The bones are boiled in the pickle and then removed before adding the stuffed pigeons to the pickle for preservation.

## Options and commentary
- Instead of pigeons, you can use chicken or Cornish hens as a modern alternative.
- Feel free to adjust the seasonings and herbs according to your taste preferences.
- The pickling liquid can be customized by adding additional spices or herbs for more flavor.
