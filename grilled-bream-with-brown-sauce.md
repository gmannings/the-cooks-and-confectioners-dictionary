## Ingredients:

- Melted butter
- For the brown sauce:
  - 2 anchovies, finely chopped
  - 1 tablespoon capers, drained and chopped
  - 1 tablespoon chives, chopped
  - 1 tablespoon parsley, chopped
  - 1 tablespoon butter
  - 1/2 cup fish broth

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the grill or preheat the oven to a high broil setting.
2. Prepare the bream by scaling and gutting it. Make sure it is clean and pat dry with paper towels.
3. Notch the side of the bream by making shallow cuts along the length of the fish. This will help the flavors penetrate the flesh.
4. Dip the bream in melted butter, making sure to coat both sides.
5. Place the bream on a preheated grill or on a broiler pan in the oven.
6. Baste the bream frequently with melted butter to keep it moist and add flavor.
7. While the bream is grilling, prepare the brown sauce. In a saucepan, melt the butter over medium heat.
8. Add the chopped anchovies, capers, chives, and parsley to the saucepan. Cook for a few minutes until the ingredients are fragrant and slightly softened.
9. Pour in the fish broth and bring the mixture to a simmer. Let it cook for a few minutes to allow the flavors to meld together.
10. Gradually whisk in the cullis, a little at a time, until the sauce thickens to your desired consistency. Keep the sauce warm on low heat.
11. If you are making the white sauce or herb sauce, follow the respective recipes and keep them warm as well.
12. Once the bream is cooked through and has a golden brown color, remove it from the grill or oven.
13. Serve the grilled bream on a platter and pour the brown sauce over it. Alternatively, you can serve the bream with the white sauce or herb sauce.
14. Garnish with additional chopped herbs if desired.
15. Enjoy your grilled bream with your choice of sauce!

## Cooking time
- Grilling or broiling time will vary depending on the size and thickness of the bream. As a general guideline, grill or broil the bream for about 8-10 minutes per side, or until the flesh is opaque and flakes easily with a fork.
