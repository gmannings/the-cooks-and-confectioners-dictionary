# Thaking Pudding

## Description
Thaking Pudding is a rich and creamy dessert made with a combination of spices, cream, almonds, eggs, and bread. It has a smooth texture and a delightful flavor. This recipe is a modernized version of an 18th-century recipe.

## Options and commentary
- You can add raisins or currants to the pudding for added texture and flavor.
- Instead of boiling the pudding, you can also bake it in the oven at 180Â°C for about 45 minutes or until set.
- Serve the pudding warm or chilled, and you can top it with a dollop of whipped cream or a sprinkle of cinnamon for extra indulgence.

## Ingredients:
- 1/2 teaspoon ground mace
- 1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg
- 1/2 teaspoon ground ginger
- 1 liter of heavy cream
- 100 grams of almonds, finely chopped
- 1 tablespoon rose water
- 8 eggs
- 2 slices of ginger, thinly sliced
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 100 grams of sugar
- 100 grams of grated bread
- Butter, for greasing
- 2 tablespoons of butter, melted
- 2 tablespoons of verjuice (or lemon juice)
- 2 tablespoons of sugar

## Instructions:
1. In a saucepan, combine the ground mace, ground nutmeg, ground ginger, and heavy cream. Heat over medium heat until it starts to simmer. Remove from heat and let it cool for a few minutes.
2. In a bowl, mix the chopped almonds with rose water until well combined. Set aside.
3. In a separate bowl, beat the eggs until well combined. Set aside.
4. Once the cream mixture has cooled slightly, strain it into the bowl with the beaten eggs. Stir well to combine.
5. Add the sliced ginger, salt, sugar, and grated bread to the mixture. Stir until all the ingredients are evenly distributed.
6. Butter a cloth and dust it with flour. Place the pudding mixture onto the cloth and tie it tightly with kitchen twine, leaving some room for the pudding to expand.
7. Fill a large pot with water and bring it to a boil. Carefully place the tied pudding into the boiling water. Reduce the heat to a simmer and cover the pot. Cook for about 2 hours, making sure to check the water level occasionally and adding more boiling water if needed.
8. After 2 hours, carefully remove the pudding from the pot and let it cool for a few minutes. Untie the cloth and transfer the pudding to a serving dish.
9. In a small saucepan, melt the butter. Drizzle the melted butter over the pudding.
10. In a separate bowl, mix the verjuice (or lemon juice) with sugar until the sugar is dissolved. Drizzle the mixture over the pudding.
11. Serve the Thaking Pudding warm or chilled.
