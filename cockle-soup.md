# Cockle Soup

## Description
Cockle Soup is a creamy seafood soup made with boiled cockles and fresh fish. It is thickened with a cullis (a rich sauce) and served with a fried bread roll in the center. The soup is garnished with a rim of pastry and the cockle shells. It is a delicious and elegant dish that can be served as a starter or a light main course.

## Ingredients:
- Cockles (approximately 500g)
- Fresh fish fillets (approximately 500g)
- Cullis (a rich sauce)
- French roll
- Butter
- Pastry for garnish
- Yolk of an egg
- Lemon

## Instructions:
1. Boil the cockles in a large pot of water until they open. Remove the cockles from the shells and set them aside.
2. Wash the cockles thoroughly to remove any sand or grit.
3. In a saucepan, combine the fresh fish fillets and the cullis. Cook over medium heat until the fish is cooked through.
4. Strain the fish and cullis mixture through a sieve to achieve a creamy consistency.
5. Add a small amount of the fish and cullis mixture to the cockles in a saucepan.
6. Cut off the top of a French roll and remove the crumb. Fry the roll in a little butter until golden brown.
7. Place the fried roll in the middle of a soup dish. Soak the bread with some of the fish and cullis mixture.
8. Garnish the soup dish with a rim of pastry, placing the cockle shells around the outside.
9. Thicken the cockles with the yolk of an egg, similar to a fricassee. Place one or two cockles in each shell around the soup dish. Fill the hollowed French roll in the middle with the thickened cockles.
10. Heat the remaining fish and cullis mixture until boiling hot. Squeeze a little lemon juice into the mixture and over the cockles.
11. Serve the Cockle Soup hot.
