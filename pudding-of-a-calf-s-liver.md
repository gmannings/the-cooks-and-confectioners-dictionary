# Pudding of a Calf's Liver

## Description
This recipe is for a savory pudding made with calf's liver. The liver is diced and minced with hogs fat, then seasoned with salt, pepper, nutmeg, cloves, cinnamon, cives, and savory herbs. The mixture is combined with egg yolks and cream, stuffed into casings, and boiled in white wine with salt and bay leaves. The puddings are then cooled in the cooking liquid and can be grilled before serving.

## Ingredients:
- 500g calf's liver
- 150g hogs fat (or substitute with bacon or pork fat)
- Salt, to taste
- Pepper, to taste
- 1/2 teaspoon grated nutmeg
- 1/2 teaspoon ground cloves
- 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
- 2 tablespoons chopped cives (or substitute with green onions)
- 2 tablespoons chopped savory herbs (such as parsley, thyme, and rosemary)
- 6 egg yolks
- 1 liter cream (or more, as needed)
- Casings for stuffing (such as sausage casings)
- 500ml white wine
- Salt, for boiling
- 2 bay leaves

## Instructions:
1. Dice a portion of the calf's liver into small cubes and set aside.
2. Mince the remaining calf's liver and hogs fat together until finely chopped.
3. In a large bowl, combine the minced liver and fat mixture with the diced liver.
4. Season the mixture with salt, pepper, grated nutmeg, ground cloves, ground cinnamon, chopped cives, and savory herbs. Mix well to evenly distribute the seasonings.
5. In a separate bowl, whisk together the egg yolks and cream until well combined.
6. Pour the egg and cream mixture into the liver mixture and mix thoroughly until everything is well incorporated. Adjust the amount of cream as needed to achieve a moist but not too runny consistency.
7. Prepare the casings for stuffing by rinsing them thoroughly and soaking them in water according to the manufacturer's instructions.
8. Stuff the liver mixture into the casings, making sure to pack them tightly and eliminate any air pockets. Tie off the ends of the casings.
9. In a large pot, bring the white wine to a boil. Add salt and bay leaves to the boiling wine.
10. Carefully place the stuffed casings into the boiling wine. Reduce the heat to low and simmer the puddings for about 1 hour, or until cooked through.
11. Once cooked, remove the pot from the heat and allow the puddings to cool in the cooking liquid.
12. When ready to serve, remove the puddings from the cooking liquid and grill them over medium heat until heated through and slightly browned on the outside.
13. Serve the hot grilled puddings as a main dish or as a side dish with your choice of accompaniments.
