# Fried Eggs as Round as Balls

## Description
This recipe is for frying eggs in a unique way that results in perfectly round shapes, resembling balls. The eggs are cooked in hot clarified butter and are served warm. They can be enjoyed on their own or served with fried or roasted collops.

## Ingredients:
- 3 pints (1.4 liters) clarified butter
- Eggs

## Instructions:
1. Take a deep frying pan and heat the clarified butter over high heat until it reaches the temperature suitable for frying fritters.
2. Stir the butter with a stick until it creates a whirlpool effect.
3. Break an egg into the middle of the whirlpool of butter.
4. Using a stick, gently turn the egg around in the butter until it becomes as firm as a softly poached egg. The swirling motion of the butter will help shape the egg into a round ball.
5. Carefully lift the cooked egg out of the butter using a slice or spatula.
6. Place the fried egg into a warm pipkin or dish.
7. Lean the pipkin or dish in front of a fire to keep the fried eggs warm.
8. Repeat steps 3-7 for as many eggs as desired.
9. Serve the fried eggs as they are or alongside fried or roasted collops.
