# Lark Pie

## Description
Lark Pie is a traditional dish made with larks, a type of small bird. The birds are stuffed with a mixture of bread, eggs, spices, and dried fruit, then baked in a pie crust. The pie is rich and flavorful, with a combination of sweet and savory flavors.

## Ingredients:
- 12 larks
- 2 penny manchets (small loaves of bread)
- Salt
- 3 eggs
- 60 ml rosewater
- 450 g currants
- 7 g beaten mace
- 7 g cinnamon
- Nutmeg, grated
- 225 g butter, sliced
- 1 lemon, sliced
- 225 g candied lemon and citron
- 7 g whole mace
- Pie crust (for a 9-inch pie)

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F).
2. In a large bowl, combine the penny manchets, salt, eggs, rosewater, currants, beaten mace, cinnamon, and grated nutmeg. Mix well to combine.
3. Take each lark and stuff its belly with a ball of the mixture, about the size of a walnut. Repeat for all the larks.
4. Place the stuffed larks in a pie dish or baking dish.
5. Layer the sliced butter, lemon slices, candied lemon and citron, and whole mace over the larks.
6. Roll out the pie crust and cover the larks with it, sealing the edges.
7. Bake the pie in the preheated oven for about 1 hour, or until the crust is golden brown and the larks are cooked through.
8. Remove the pie from the oven and brush the top with melted butter.
9. Serve the Lark Pie hot.
