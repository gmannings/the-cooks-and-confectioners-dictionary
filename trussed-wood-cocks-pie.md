# Trussed Wood-cocks Pie

## Description
This recipe is for a traditional 18th-century dish called Trussed Wood-cocks Pie. Wood-cocks are small game birds that were commonly used in cooking during that time period. The birds are trussed, meaning they are prepared for cooking by tying them with string to maintain their shape. The wood-cocks are then seasoned, stuffed with a flavorful mixture, and baked in a pie. The pie is then served with a rich sauce made from the cooking juices and other ingredients.

## Ingredients:
- 2 wood-cocks
- Salt and pepper
- Spices (such as cloves, nutmeg, or allspice)
- Fresh herbs (such as thyme, rosemary, or sage)
- 100g lardons (thick strips of bacon)
- 50g scraped bacon, finely chopped
- 50g mushrooms, finely chopped
- 50g truffles, finely chopped (optional)
- 2 tbsp chives, finely chopped
- 2 tbsp parsley, finely chopped
- 1 bay leaf
- 4 slices of bacon, for covering the pie
- 500g puff pastry
- 250ml wood-cock or partridge stock (or chicken stock)
- 2 veal sweetbreads, blanched and sliced
- 50g mushrooms, sliced
- 50g truffles, sliced (optional)
- Juice of 1 lemon

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F).
2. Truss the wood-cocks by tying their legs together with kitchen twine.
3. Place the wood-cocks on a cutting board and use a rolling pin to gently beat them on the breast side to break the bones. This will help the birds cook more evenly.
4. Remove the livers from the wood-cocks and set them aside.
5. Season the wood-cocks with salt, pepper, and your choice of spices. Rub the seasoning all over the birds.
6. In a bowl, mix together the lardons, scraped bacon, mushrooms, truffles (if using), chives, and parsley. Season the mixture with salt, pepper, and spices.
7. Stuff the wood-cocks with the bacon mixture, filling the cavities as much as possible.
8. Place the wood-cocks in a pie dish, arranging them along the back with the livers.
9. Add the sliced mushrooms, truffles (if using), and bay leaf to the pie dish, scattering them around the wood-cocks.
10. Cover the wood-cocks with slices of bacon, ensuring they are completely covered.
11. Roll out the puff pastry on a floured surface to fit the size of the pie dish. Place the pastry over the wood-cocks and press the edges to seal.
12. Make a small hole in the center of the pastry to allow steam to escape during baking.
13. Place the pie dish in the preheated oven and bake for about 1 hour, or until the pastry is golden brown and the wood-cocks are cooked through.
14. Once the pie is cooked, remove it from the oven and let it cool slightly.
15. Cut off the pastry lid and remove the bacon slices from the top of the wood-cocks.
16. Skim off any excess fat from the cooking juices in the pie dish.
17. In a saucepan, heat the wood-cock or partridge stock (or chicken stock) over medium heat.
18. Add the veal sweetbreads, sliced mushrooms, and truffles (if using) to the stock and simmer for a few minutes until heated through.
19. Squeeze in the juice of a lemon and stir well.
20. Pour the hot stock mixture over the wood-cocks in the pie dish, ensuring they are well coated.
21. Serve the Trussed Wood-cocks Pie hot as a first course.
