# Pork and Beef Sausages

## Description
This recipe is for making traditional pork and beef sausages. The meat is seasoned with a blend of spices and herbs, then stuffed into hog casings. The sausages are boiled and then hung up to dry, resulting in a flavorful and preserved meat product.

## Ingredients:
- 1 pork loin
- 4 pounds beef suet
- 1 ounce pepper
- 1 ounce mace
- 1/2 ounce cloves
- A handful of sage
- A handful of rosemary
- 10 eggs
- Hog casings

## Instructions:
1. Preheat oven to 180°C (350°F).
2. In a large pot, bring water to a boil. Add the pork loin and let it soak for 2 hours.
3. Remove the pork loin from the pot and trim off all the fat. Chop the lean meat into very small pieces.
4. Finely shred the beef suet.
5. In a mixing bowl, combine the chopped pork loin, shredded beef suet, pepper, mace, cloves, sage, and rosemary. Mix well to evenly distribute the spices and herbs.
6. Crack the eggs into a separate bowl and beat them lightly. Add the beaten eggs to the meat mixture and mix until everything is well combined.
7. Prepare the hog casings by rinsing them thoroughly under cold water.
8. Stuff the meat mixture into the hog casings, using a sausage stuffer or a piping bag fitted with a large nozzle. Twist the casings at regular intervals to form individual sausages.
9. Fill a large pot with water and bring it to a gentle boil. Carefully place the sausages into the boiling water and cook them for about 10 minutes.
10. Remove the sausages from the pot and hang them up in a well-ventilated area, such as a chimney or a cool, dry place. Allow them to dry for several days until they have a firm texture.
11. Once the sausages are dry, they can be stored in a cool, dry place or refrigerated until ready to use.
