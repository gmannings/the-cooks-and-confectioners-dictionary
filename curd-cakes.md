# Curd Cakes

## Description
Curd Cakes are a sweet and fluffy dessert made with curds (similar to cottage cheese), eggs, sugar, nutmeg, and flour. They are fried in butter until golden brown and can be enjoyed as a snack or dessert.

## Ingredients:
- 1 quart of curds (about 950 grams of cottage cheese or ricotta cheese)
- 8 eggs (4 whole eggs and 4 egg whites)
- 1/2 cup sugar (100 grams)
- 1/2 teaspoon grated nutmeg
- 1/4 cup all-purpose flour (30 grams)
- Butter for frying

## Instructions:
1. In a large mixing bowl, combine the curds, 4 whole eggs, sugar, grated nutmeg, and flour. Mix well until all the ingredients are thoroughly combined.
2. In a separate bowl, beat the 4 egg whites until stiff peaks form.
3. Gently fold the beaten egg whites into the curd mixture until well incorporated.
4. Heat a frying pan over medium heat and add enough butter to coat the bottom of the pan.
5. Once the butter is hot, drop spoonfuls of the curd batter into the pan, similar to making fritters. Leave some space between each cake to allow them to spread slightly.
6. Cook the curd cakes for 2-3 minutes on each side, or until they are golden brown and cooked through.
7. Remove the cooked curd cakes from the pan and place them on a paper towel-lined plate to absorb any excess oil.
8. Repeat the process with the remaining batter, adding more butter to the pan as needed.
9. Serve the curd cakes warm as a delicious snack or dessert.
