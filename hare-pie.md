# Hare Pie

## Description
Hare Pie is a traditional British dish made with hare meat, seasoned with spices and baked in a pie crust. The meat is first larded (wrapped in bacon) to keep it moist and flavorful. The pie is then filled with the seasoned hare meat and topped with more bacon. After baking, melted butter is poured into the pie and the hole is sealed. The pie is then allowed to cool before serving.

## Ingredients:
- 1 hare, bones broken
- Salt, to taste
- Pepper, to taste
- Nutmeg, to taste
- Cloves, to taste
- 1 bay leaf
- Slices of bacon
- Pie crust
- Melted butter

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F).
2. Season the hare meat with salt, pepper, nutmeg, cloves, and the bay leaf. Ensure that the meat is well coated with the spices.
3. Lard the hare by wrapping it with slices of bacon. This will help keep the meat moist during baking.
4. Line the bottom of a pie dish with slices of bacon.
5. Place the seasoned and larded hare meat into the pie dish.
6. Cover the hare meat with more slices of bacon.
7. Roll out the pie crust and cover the pie dish, ensuring that the edges are sealed.
8. Bake the pie in the preheated oven for approximately 1.5 to 2 hours, or until the hare meat is cooked through and the crust is golden brown.
9. Remove the pie from the oven and carefully pour melted butter into the hole in the pie crust to add richness and flavor.
10. Seal the hole in the pie crust with additional pastry or use a decorative pie vent.
11. Allow the pie to cool completely before serving.
