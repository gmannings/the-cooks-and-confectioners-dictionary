# Forced Leg of Lamb

## Description
This recipe involves deboning a leg of lamb and stuffing it with a flavorful mixture of chopped lamb meat, marrow, beef suet, oysters, anchovies, onion, sweet herbs, and lemon peel. The stuffed lamb is then roasted or baked and served with a rich gravy made from oysters, mushrooms, and anchovy sauce. The dish is garnished with pickles and lemon.

## Options and commentary
- Instead of deboning the leg of lamb yourself, you can ask your butcher to do it for you.
- If you prefer a different type of meat, you can use a boneless pork loin or a boneless beef roast instead of lamb.
- If you don't like oysters or anchovies, you can omit them from the stuffing and gravy.
- You can adjust the seasoning according to your taste preferences.

## Ingredients:
- 1 leg of lamb, deboned
- 200g lamb meat, finely chopped
- 50g marrow, finely chopped
- 50g beef suet, finely chopped
- 6 oysters, finely chopped
- 4 anchovies, finely chopped
- 1 onion, finely chopped
- 2 tablespoons sweet herbs (such as parsley, thyme, and rosemary), finely chopped
- 1 tablespoon lemon peel, grated
- Salt and pepper to taste
- 1/2 teaspoon nutmeg, grated
- 1/2 teaspoon mace, grated
- Flour for dusting
- Butter for basting
- 200ml white wine
- 200ml strong gravy
- 1 blade of mace
- 6 oysters
- 100g mushrooms, sliced
- 1 tablespoon anchovy sauce
- 1 tablespoon flour
- 1 egg yolk
- Juice of 1 lemon
- Pickles and lemon slices for garnish

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F) if roasting or 160°C (320°F) if baking.

2. In a large bowl, combine the chopped lamb meat, marrow, beef suet, oysters, anchovies, onion, sweet herbs, lemon peel, salt, pepper, nutmeg, and mace. Mix well until all the ingredients are evenly distributed.

3. Lay the deboned leg of lamb flat on a cutting board, skin side down. Make a long slit along the backside of the lamb, being careful not to cut through the other side. Open up the lamb and remove all the meat, leaving the skin intact.

4. Spread the stuffing mixture evenly over the lamb skin. Roll up the lamb tightly and secure with kitchen twine or skewers. If roasting, place the lamb on a roasting rack. If baking, place the lamb in a baking dish.

5. Brush the lamb with beaten egg yolks. Dust with flour and drizzle with melted butter.

6. Roast the lamb in the preheated oven for about 1 hour and 30 minutes, or until the internal temperature reaches 60°C (140°F) for medium-rare. If baking, cover the dish with foil and bake for about 2 hours, or until the internal temperature reaches 60°C (140°F) for medium-rare.

7. While the lamb is roasting or baking, prepare the gravy. In a saucepan, stew the remaining oysters in white wine with a blade of mace. Set aside the largest oysters for later. Add anchovy sauce, mushrooms, and strong gravy to the saucepan. Simmer for 10 minutes.

8. In a separate pan, fry the thinly sliced loin of lamb in clarified butter until cooked through. Season with salt, pepper, nutmeg, cloves, and mace. Add the fried lamb to the gravy mixture and continue to simmer.

9. Remove the lamb from the oven and let it rest for 10 minutes before carving.

10. In a small bowl, mix flour, egg yolk, and lemon juice to make a thick paste. Add the paste to the gravy mixture and stir well to thicken.

11. Carve the stuffed leg of lamb into slices and arrange on a serving platter. Pour the gravy over the lamb and garnish with pickles and lemon slices.
