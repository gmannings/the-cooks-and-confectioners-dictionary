# Compoft of Strawberries

## Description
Compoft of Strawberries is a sweet and fruity dessert made with ripe strawberries and sugar. The strawberries are cooked in a sugar syrup until they become soft and release their juices, creating a delicious compote.

## Ingredients:
- 500g ripe strawberries
- 200g sugar

## Instructions:
1. Wash the strawberries thoroughly and remove the stems.
2. In a saucepan, bring the sugar and a little water to a boil, stirring until the sugar is dissolved. 
3. Continue boiling the sugar syrup until it reaches the "pearled" stage. This means that the syrup has thickened slightly and has a glossy appearance.
4. Add the strawberries to the syrup and gently stir to coat them evenly.
5. Reduce the heat to low and cover the saucepan. Allow the strawberries to simmer in the syrup for about 10-15 minutes, or until they become soft and release their juices.
6. Remove the saucepan from the heat and let the compote cool slightly.
7. Transfer the compote to a serving dish or individual bowls.
8. Serve the compote warm or chilled, as desired.
