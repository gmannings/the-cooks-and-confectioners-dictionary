# Potage of Fat Pullets

## Description
Potage of Fat Pullets is a rich and flavorful soup made with pieces of marinated and fried chicken, garnished with another boiled chicken. It is served with a cullis sauce made from the bones of the marinated chicken, bread crumbs, and broth. This dish is hearty and satisfying, perfect for a special occasion or a comforting meal.

## Ingredients:
- 1 fat pullet (approximately 1.5 kg)
- Juice of 2 lemons
- 200 ml verjuice (or substitute with a mixture of white wine and vinegar)
- Salt and pepper to taste
- 100 g bread crumbs
- 500 ml chicken broth

## Instructions:
1. Cut the fat pullet into pieces and place them in a bowl.
2. In a separate bowl, mix together the lemon juice, verjuice, salt, and pepper to create a marinade.
3. Pour the marinade over the chicken pieces, ensuring they are well coated. Let the chicken marinate for at least 1 hour, or overnight in the refrigerator.
4. In a large frying pan, heat enough verjuice (or substitute) to cover the bottom of the pan.
5. Remove the chicken pieces from the marinade and pat them dry with paper towels.
6. Fry the chicken pieces in the hot verjuice until they are golden brown and cooked through. Remove from the pan and set aside.
7. In a separate pot, bring the chicken broth to a simmer.
8. Place the boiled fat pullet in the simmering broth and let it cook for about 30 minutes, until the meat is tender and cooked through.
9. While the boiled chicken is cooking, prepare the cullis sauce. In a blender or food processor, blend the bones of the marinated pullet, bread crumbs, and enough chicken broth to create a smooth sauce.
10. Once the boiled chicken is cooked, remove it from the pot and let it cool slightly. Remove the meat from the bones and shred it into bite-sized pieces.
11. To serve, place the shredded chicken in a soup bowl. Ladle the cullis sauce over the chicken, and then pour the hot broth from the potage over the sauce.
12. Garnish the potage with the fried chicken pieces and serve hot.
