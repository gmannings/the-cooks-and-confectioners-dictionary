# Pike in Cafferole

## Description
This recipe is for a dish called "Pike in Cafferole" from the 18th century. It involves scaling a pike, larding it with eel flesh, and stewing it in a flavorful mixture of white wine, burnt butter, verjuice, and various spices. The dish is then served with a ragout of mushrooms, oysters, and capers, and garnished with fried mushrooms, carp roes, and slices of lemon.

## Options and commentary
- If you cannot find a whole pike, you can use pike fillets instead.
- Verjuice is a sour juice made from unripe grapes. If you cannot find verjuice, you can substitute it with a combination of lemon juice and white wine vinegar.
- The fweet herbs mentioned in the recipe likely refer to a mixture of fresh herbs such as parsley, thyme, and bay leaves.
- Carp roes may be difficult to find, so you can omit them if necessary.

## Ingredients:
- 1 whole pike (or pike fillets)
- Flesh of 1 eel (for larding)
- 250ml white wine
- 50g butter

## Instructions:
1. Scale the pike and clean it thoroughly. If using pike fillets, skip this step.
