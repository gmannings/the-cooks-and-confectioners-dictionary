# Syrup of Currants

## Description
Syrup of Currants is a sweet and tangy syrup made from the juice of currants and sugar. It can be used as a topping for pancakes, waffles, or ice cream, or as a flavoring for cocktails and mocktails.

## Ingredients:
- 500g currants
- 500g sugar

## Instructions:
1. Wash the currants thoroughly and remove any stems or leaves.
2. Place the currants in a straining bag or cheesecloth and squeeze out the juice into a bowl or jug.
3. Measure the amount of currant juice obtained and pour it into a saucepan.
4. In a separate saucepan, heat the sugar over medium heat until it reaches a temperature just below the "crack" stage. This is approximately 150°C (300°F) on a candy thermometer.
5. Slowly pour the hot sugar syrup into the currant juice, stirring continuously to combine.
6. Continue to heat the mixture over low heat, stirring occasionally, until the sugar is completely dissolved and the syrup has thickened slightly.
7. Remove the syrup from the heat and let it cool completely.
8. Once cooled, transfer the syrup to a sterilized bottle or jar for storage.

## Cooking time
Approximately 30 minutes
