# Cutlets of Veal or Mutton

## Description
This recipe is for tender and flavorful cutlets of veal or mutton. The meat is seasoned, covered with a layer of forcemeat, wrapped in paper, and then broiled. The cutlets are served with a buttery gravy and a hint of lemon.

## Options and commentary
- You can use either veal or mutton for this recipe, depending on your preference.
- Forcemeat is a mixture of ground meat, breadcrumbs, and seasonings. You can use any forcemeat recipe you like, or you can use a pre-made stuffing mix.
- The paper wrapping helps to keep the cutlets moist and tender while they cook. You can use parchment paper or aluminum foil as a modern alternative.
- The sauce can be made by combining butter, gravy, and lemon juice. You can use store-bought gravy or make your own from pan drippings.

## Ingredients:
- 4 veal or mutton cutlets
- Salt and pepper
- Forcemeat (recipe in Letter F)
- 4 half sheets of white paper
- Melted butter
- Grated bread
- Butter
- Gravy
- Lemon

## Instructions:
1. Preheat your broiler or grill.
2. Using a meat mallet or the back of a cleaver, gently pound the cutlets to flatten them slightly. Season both sides of the cutlets with salt and pepper.
3. Prepare the forcemeat according to the recipe in Letter F or use a pre-made stuffing mix.
4. Spread a layer of forcemeat on one side of each cutlet, leaving a 2-inch border around the bone.
5. Take a half sheet of paper and brush one side with melted butter. Sprinkle grated bread over the buttered side.
6. Place a cutlet on the buttered side of the paper, positioning it so that the bone sticks out about an inch. Fold the two ends of the paper over the cutlet, trimming off any excess.
7. Repeat steps 5 and 6 for the remaining cutlets.
8. Place the wrapped cutlets on a broiler pan or grill rack and broil for 45 minutes for veal or 30 minutes for mutton, or until cooked to your desired doneness. The paper wrapping will help keep the cutlets moist.
9. While the cutlets are cooking, prepare the sauce. In a saucepan, melt butter and add gravy and the juice of a lemon. Heat until warmed through.
10. Remove the paper from the cutlets and arrange them in a circular pattern on a serving dish, with the bones facing outward.
11. Pour the sauce over the cutlets and serve hot.
