# Jelly of Barberries

## Description
This recipe is for making a sweet and tangy jelly using barberries. Barberries are small, tart berries that add a unique flavor to the jelly. The jelly is made by boiling the barberries with sugar to create a thick syrup, which is then strained and boiled again to create a smooth jelly consistency. The jelly can be enjoyed on toast, scones, or used as a filling for pastries.

## Ingredients:
- 1.4 kg barberries
- 1.4 kg sugar

## Instructions:
1. In a large pot, combine the barberries and sugar.
2. Place the pot over medium heat and bring the mixture to a boil.
3. Allow the mixture to boil until the sugar reaches the "crack" stage. This is when a small amount of the syrup dropped into cold water forms hard threads that crack when bent.
4. Once the sugar has reached the crack stage, add the barberries to the pot.
5. Continue to boil the mixture, stirring occasionally, until the syrup reaches a consistency between smooth and pearled. This may take about 30-40 minutes.
6. Skim off any scum that rises to the surface of the syrup.
7. Place a fine sieve over a bowl and pour the syrup into the sieve to strain out the barberry solids. Allow the syrup to drain completely.
8. Transfer the strained syrup back to the pot and bring it to a boil again.
9. Skim off any scum that rises to the surface of the syrup.
10. Once the syrup has reached a jelly-like consistency, remove it from the heat.
11. Let the jelly stand for two to three days to allow any remaining scum to rise to the surface.
12. Skim off the thin scum that forms on the surface of the jelly.
13. Transfer the jelly to clean, sterilized pots and seal with lids.
14. Allow the jelly to cool completely before using.
15. Store the jelly in a cool, dark place for future use.
