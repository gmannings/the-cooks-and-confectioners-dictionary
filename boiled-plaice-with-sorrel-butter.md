# Boiled Plaice with Sorrel Butter

## Description
This recipe is for boiled plaice, a simple and flavorful dish that showcases the delicate flavor of the fish. The plaice is boiled in a mixture of white-wine vinegar, ginger, cloves, and mace, and then served with a tangy sorrel butter sauce. The dish is garnished with bread, lemon slices, and either barberries or grapes.

## Options and commentary
- Plaice: Plaice is a flatfish with a mild and delicate flavor. If plaice is not available, you can use other white fish such as sole or flounder.
- White-wine vinegar: You can use any white wine vinegar or substitute with lemon juice for a tangy flavor.
- Ginger, cloves, and mace: These spices add warmth and depth to the dish. If you don't have whole spices, you can use ground versions, but reduce the amount by half.
- Sorrel: Sorrel is a leafy green herb with a tart and lemony flavor. If you can't find sorrel, you can substitute with spinach or watercress for a similar tangy taste.
- Barberries or grapes: Barberries are small, tart berries that add a pop of color and flavor to the dish. If you can't find barberries, you can use grapes for a slightly sweeter taste.

## Ingredients:
- 2 plaice fillets
- 1 cup white-wine vinegar
- 1 teaspoon shredded ginger
- 2-3 whole cloves
- 2-3 whole mace blades
- 1/2 cup unsalted butter
- 1 cup sorrel leaves, chopped
- Juice of 1 lemon
- 4 slices of bread
- 1 lemon, sliced
- 1/4 cup barberries or grapes

## Instructions:
1. In a large pot, combine the white-wine vinegar, shredded ginger, cloves, and mace blades. Add enough water to the pot to fully submerge the plaice fillets.
2. Bring the liquid to a boil over medium heat.
3. Reduce the heat to low and carefully add the plaice fillets to the pot. Simmer gently for about 5 minutes, or until the fish is cooked through and flakes easily with a fork.
4. While the fish is cooking, prepare the sorrel butter sauce. In a small saucepan, melt the butter over low heat.
5. Add the chopped sorrel leaves to the melted butter and cook for 2-3 minutes, until the sorrel wilts.
6. Remove the saucepan from the heat and stir in the lemon juice. Set aside.
7. Once the fish is cooked, carefully remove the fillets from the pot and place them on a serving platter.
8. Pour the sorrel butter sauce over the fish fillets.
9. Toast the slices of bread and arrange them around the fish on the platter.
10. Garnish the dish with lemon slices and barberries or grapes.
11. Serve the boiled plaice immediately with the sorrel butter sauce, bread, and garnishes.
