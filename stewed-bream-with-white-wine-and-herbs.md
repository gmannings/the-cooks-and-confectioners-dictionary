# Stewed Bream with White Wine and Herbs

## Description
This recipe is a modernized version of an 18th-century recipe for stewed bream. The bream is cooked in a flavorful mixture of white wine, water, and beer vinegar, along with a variety of herbs and spices. The dish is served on sippets (toasted bread) and garnished with grated bread. It is a delicious and aromatic seafood dish that can be enjoyed as a main course.

## Ingredients:
- 1 whole bream, cleaned and scaled
- 250 ml white wine
- 250 ml water
- 125 ml beer vinegar (or substitute with white wine vinegar)
- Salt and pepper to taste
- 1 bay leaf
- 4 whole cloves
- 1/2 teaspoon ground mace
- 1 sprig of rosemary
- 1 sprig of winter savory
- 1 sprig of sweet marjoram
- 1 sprig of thyme
- 1 small onion, cut in half
- 50 g butter
- Sippets (toasted bread) for serving
- Grated bread for garnish
- Lemon wedges for serving

## Instructions:
1. In a stewpan, combine the white wine, water, and beer vinegar. The liquid should be enough to just cover the bream.
2. Season the liquid with salt and pepper to taste.
3. Add the bay leaf, whole cloves, and ground mace to the liquid.
4. Tie the sprigs of rosemary, winter savory, sweet marjoram, and thyme together with kitchen twine to make a faggot.
5. Place the faggot of herbs and the halved onion in the stewpan.
6. Add the butter to the stewpan.
7. Place the cleaned and scaled bream into the stewpan, either whole or in pieces.
8. Bring the liquid to a simmer over medium heat.
9. Reduce the heat to low and let the bream stew gently for about 15-20 minutes, or until cooked through. The cooking time may vary depending on the size and thickness of the bream.
10. While the bream is cooking, prepare the sippets by toasting slices of bread until golden brown.
11. Once the bream is cooked, carefully remove it from the stewpan and place it on a serving dish lined with the sippets.
12. Strain the cooking liquid, discarding the herbs and onion.
13. In a small saucepan, melt some butter and whisk in a few tablespoons of the strained cooking liquid to make a sauce.
14. Pour the sauce over the bream and sippets.
15. Garnish the dish with grated bread.
16. Serve the stewed bream with lemon wedges on the side.

## Cooking time
Approximately 15-20 minutes, depending on the size and thickness of the bream.
