# White Metheglin

## Description
White Metheglin is a traditional 18th-century honey-based beverage flavored with a variety of herbs and spices. It is a refreshing and aromatic drink that can be enjoyed on its own or used as a base for cocktails.

## Options and commentary
- You can adjust the amount of herbs and spices according to your taste preferences.
- If you prefer a sweeter drink, you can add more honey.
- The fermentation process may take several weeks, so be patient and allow the yeast to do its work.

## Ingredients:
- 20 liters of spring water
- 1 handful of sage leaves
- 1 handful of thyme leaves
- 1 handful of savory leaves
- 1 handful of rosemary leaves
- 40 grams of bruised Jamaica pepper (allspice)
- 40 grams of bruised coriander seeds
- 40 grams of bruised caraway seeds
- 20 grams of cinnamon sticks
- 20 grams of winter cinnamon sticks
- 10 grams of nutmegs
- 10 grams of cloves
- 10 grams of mace
- 1.5 kilograms of honey
- 250 ml of fresh ale yeast

## Instructions:
1. In a large pot, combine the spring water, sage leaves, thyme leaves, savory leaves, rosemary leaves, bruised Jamaica pepper, bruised coriander seeds, bruised caraway seeds, cinnamon sticks, winter cinnamon sticks, nutmegs, cloves, and mace.
2. Place the herbs and spices in a net bag and add it to the pot.
3. Simmer the mixture over low heat for three hours, making sure it does not come to a boil.
4. After three hours, remove the pot from heat and let it cool slightly.
5. While the mixture is still warm, add the honey and stir until it is fully dissolved. The sweetness should be enough that an egg will float on top.
6. Allow the mixture to cool to room temperature.
7. Once the mixture has cooled, add the fresh ale yeast and stir gently to incorporate.
8. Cover the pot with a clean cloth and let it sit in a cool, dark place for several days until the yeast begins to fall.
9. Remove the net bag of spices from the pot and discard.
10. Transfer the mixture to a fermentation vessel, such as a cask, and seal it with an airlock.
11. Allow the mixture to ferment for several weeks, filling it up daily with the same liquor to replace any lost volume.
12. After fermentation is complete, the mead will begin to clear. At this point, add 20 grams each of bruised winter cinnamon, nutmegs, cloves, and mace to the cask.
13. Seal the cask and let the mead age until it is clear and ready for bottling.
14. Once the mead has clarified, carefully siphon it into clean bottles, leaving any sediment behind.
15. Seal the bottles and store them in a cool, dark place for at least a month to allow the flavors to meld and the carbonation to develop.
