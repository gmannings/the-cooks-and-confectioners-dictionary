# PigPre

## Description
PigPre is a traditional 18th-century dish made with young pig quarters seasoned with salt and pepper, wrapped in a pastry crust, and baked with a variety of flavorful ingredients. The dish is rich and savory, with a hint of sweetness from the butter and sugar.

## Options and commentary
- You can use pork loin or pork shoulder as a modern alternative to young pig quarters.
- Feel free to adjust the seasoning according to your taste preferences.
- You can add additional herbs and spices, such as thyme or rosemary, for extra flavor.
- Barberries may be difficult to find, so you can substitute them with cranberries or currants.

## Ingredients:
- 1 pork loin or pork shoulder
- Salt and pepper
- Pastry crust (store-bought or homemade)
- Handful of parsley, chopped
- 6 sprigs of winter savory, chopped
- 2-3 hard-boiled eggs, grated
- Blades of mace
- Handful of barberries (or cranberries/currants)
- Handful of currants
- 1/2 pound (225g) fresh butter
- Sugar

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F).

2. Remove the skin from the pork loin or pork shoulder and cut it into quarters.

3. Season the pork quarters with salt and pepper, ensuring they are evenly coated.

4. Roll out the pastry crust and line a baking dish or pie dish with it, leaving some excess pastry hanging over the edges.

5. Place the seasoned pork quarters into the pastry-lined dish.

6. Sprinkle the chopped parsley and winter savory over the pork quarters.

7. Grate the hard-boiled eggs and sprinkle them over the herbs.

8. Place blades of mace and bunches of barberries (or cranberries/currants) on top of the grated eggs.

9. Scatter the currants over the other ingredients.

10. Cut the fresh butter into small pieces and distribute them evenly over the filling.

11. Fold the excess pastry over the filling to enclose it completely. Seal the edges by pressing them together or crimping with a fork.

12. Place the pie into the preheated oven and bake for approximately 3 hours, or until the pastry is golden brown and the pork is cooked through.

13. In a separate bowl, beat the remaining 1/2 pound (225g) of butter with a little sugar until creamy.

14. Remove the pie from the oven and spread the butter-sugar mixture over the top of the pie.

15. Allow the pie to cool slightly before serving.
