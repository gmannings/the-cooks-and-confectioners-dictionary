# Leach of Almonds

## Description
Leach of Almonds is a creamy and fragrant dessert made with ground almonds, milk, rosewater, and a touch of musk. It was a popular dish in the 18th century and is still enjoyed today.

## Ingredients:
- 225g blanched almonds
- 500ml whole milk
- 2 tablespoons rosewater
- A pinch of ground musk (optional)
- 14g isinglass (gelatin sheets)

## Instructions:
1. In a mortar, finely grind the blanched almonds until they form a smooth paste.
2. In a saucepan, heat the milk over medium heat until it starts to simmer.
3. Remove the milk from the heat and gradually add it to the ground almonds, stirring constantly to combine.
4. Place a fine-mesh strainer over a clean bowl and strain the almond mixture to remove any almond solids. Press down on the solids to extract as much liquid as possible.
5. Add the rosewater and ground musk (if using) to the strained almond milk and stir well to combine.
6. In a separate small bowl, soak the isinglass sheets in cold water for about 5 minutes until they become soft and pliable.
7. Squeeze out any excess water from the softened isinglass sheets and add them to a small saucepan with a little water. Heat the saucepan over low heat, stirring constantly, until the isinglass has completely dissolved.
8. Remove the saucepan from the heat and let the isinglass mixture cool slightly.
9. Gradually pour the cooled isinglass mixture into the almond milk mixture, stirring constantly to ensure it is well incorporated.
10. Strain the mixture once again to remove any remaining impurities.
11. Pour the strained mixture into individual serving dishes or a large serving bowl.
12. Refrigerate the Leach of Almonds for at least 2 hours, or until set.
13. Serve chilled and enjoy!
