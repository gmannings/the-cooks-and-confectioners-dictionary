# Collared Beef

## Description
Collared beef is a cured and spiced beef dish that was popular in the 18th century. The beef is first soaked in a brine, then rubbed with spices, rolled up, and cooked in a mixture of water and claret wine. It is then wrapped tightly in a cloth and hung to cool and drain. This dish is typically served cold and sliced thinly.

## Ingredients:
- 1.5 kg flank beef
- 500g bay salt
- 50g salt-petre
- 1 tbsp white pepper
- 1 whole nutmeg, grated
- 1 tsp ground mace
- 1 tsp ground cloves
- Optional: fresh thyme, sweet marjoram, and parsley, shredded
- 500ml water
- 500ml claret wine
- Coarse pastry for covering

## Instructions:
1. Cut the flank beef into a square shape and remove the inward skin.
2. In a large container, prepare a brine by dissolving the bay salt in enough water to make a solution strong enough to float an egg the size of a sixpence. 
3. Place the beef in the brine and let it soak for a week.
4. After a week, remove the beef from the brine and rub it all over with salt-petre.
5. Place the beef back in the brine for an additional three days.
6. In a mortar and pestle, grind together the white pepper, nutmeg, mace, and cloves until coarse.
7. Sprinkle the spice mixture evenly over the beef, making sure to cover all sides.
8. Optional: If desired, sprinkle the shredded herbs over the beef before rolling.
9. Roll the beef tightly and tie it with kitchen twine to secure its shape.
10. Wrap the beef in a clean cloth, making sure it is tightly wrapped.
11. Place the beef in a long earthen pot and pour in the water and claret wine, filling it up halfway.
12. Cover the pot with a coarse pastry, sealing it tightly.
13. Preheat the oven to a very hot temperature.
14. Place the pot in the oven and let it cook for twelve hours.
15. After twelve hours, remove the pot from the oven and carefully remove the twine from the beef.
16. Roll the cloth tightly around the beef again and hang it up to cool and drain.
17. Once cooled, refrigerate the beef for at least a day before serving.
18. To serve, slice the collared beef thinly and enjoy it cold.
