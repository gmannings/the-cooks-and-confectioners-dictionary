# Hare Stew

## Description
This recipe is for a traditional hare stew, which was a popular dish in the 18th century. The hare is first cut into pieces and parboiled, then stewed with onions and spices until tender. The stew is served with sippets (small pieces of toasted bread) and garnished with barberries and lemon.

## Ingredients:
- 1 hare, cut into pieces
- Water
- Claret (red wine)
- 2-3 onions, sliced
- Nutmeg
- Mace
- Pepper
- Sippets (small pieces of toasted bread)
- Barberries (optional, for garnish)
- Lemon (optional, for garnish)

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F).
2. Place the pieces of hare in a large bowl and wash them in water and claret. Drain the liquid and set it aside.
3. Parboil the pieces of hare by placing them in a pot of boiling water for about 5 minutes. Remove the hare from the pot and set it aside.
4. In a large stewing pot, combine the reserved liquid from parboiling the hare, sliced onions, nutmeg, mace, and pepper. Stir to combine.
5. Add the pieces of hare to the pot, along with the head, legs, and shoulders. Divide the chine (backbone) into several parts and add them to the pot as well.
6. Place the pot over a gentle fire (low heat) and cover it with two dishes to create a gentle stewing environment. Cook the hare for about 2-3 hours, or until it is tender.
7. While the hare is stewing, prepare the sippets by toasting small pieces of bread until they are crisp.
8. Once the hare is tender, remove it from the pot and transfer it to a serving dish. Arrange the sippets around the hare.
9. Garnish the dish with barberries and lemon slices, if desired.
10. Serve the hare stew hot.
