# Preserved Barberries

## Description
Preserved barberries are a sweet and tangy condiment made from fresh barberries cooked in a syrup. They can be used in various dishes, such as salads, desserts, or as a topping for yogurt or ice cream.

## Ingredients:
- 500g barberries
- 1 liter of red wine (Claret)
- 1.5 kg sugar
- 1 liter of water

## Instructions:
1. Rinse the barberries under cold water to remove any dirt or debris.
2. In a large pot, bring the red wine (Claret) to a boil.
3. Add the barberries to the boiling wine and cook until they become soft. This should take about 10-15 minutes.
4. Strain the barberries, discarding the wine.
5. In the same pot, combine the sugar and water. Bring to a boil, stirring until the sugar has dissolved completely.
6. Reduce the heat to low and simmer the syrup for about 10 minutes, until it thickens slightly.
7. Add the cooked barberries to the syrup and stir gently to coat them evenly.
8. Continue simmering the barberries in the syrup for another 10 minutes, until the syrup thickens further.
9. Remove the pot from the heat and let the preserved barberries cool completely.
10. Transfer the preserved barberries and syrup to sterilized jars, making sure they are completely submerged in the syrup.
11. Seal the jars tightly and store them in a cool, dark place. The preserved barberries will keep for up to a year.
