# Rosemary Essence

## Description
Rosemary Essence is a concentrated liquid made from rosemary leaves. It is used to add flavor and aroma to various dishes and beverages.

## Options and commentary
- You can adjust the quantity of rosemary leaves and water depending on how much essence you want to make.
- The recipe calls for a glass vessel and a copper alembic for distillation. If you don't have these specific equipment, you can use a glass jar and a regular distillation setup.
- The recipe mentions the extraction of oil from the essence. This step is optional and can be omitted if you only want the liquid essence.

## Ingredients:
- 4 pounds (1.8 kg) rosemary leaves
- 6 quarts (5.7 liters) warm water

## Instructions:
1. Pound the rosemary leaves to release their oils.
2. Place the pounded rosemary leaves in a glass vessel.
3. Add the warm water to the glass vessel.
4. Cover the glass vessel and let it steep for two days.
5. After two days, pour the infusion into a large copper alembic or a glass jar.
6. Set up the distillation apparatus with the alembic or jar as the distillation vessel and a receiver to collect the liquid.
7. Apply heat to the alembic or jar and distill the liquid with a quick fire.
8. Collect three pints (1.4 liters) or two quarts (1.9 liters) of the distilled liquid.
9. Open the alembic or jar and carefully pour the distilled liquid into it, allowing any oil to settle at the bottom or float on top.
10. Collect the oil and transfer it to a vial. Close the vial tightly to preserve the oil.
11. Repeat the distillation process several times, extracting any remaining oil from the essence.
12. Once no more oil rises, remove the fire and distill the water left in the receiver in the same manner as rectifying brandy for spirit of wine.
13. Collect the final distilled water.

## Cooking time
Approximately 2 days for steeping the rosemary leaves, plus the time required for distillation. The distillation process may take several hours.
