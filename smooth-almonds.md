# Smooth Almonds

## Description
Smooth Almonds are a sweet treat made by coating almonds in a smooth sugar syrup. The almonds are then dried and covered with more sugar. They make a delicious snack or a lovely addition to desserts.

## Ingredients:
- 250g almonds
- 200g granulated sugar

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 180Â°C.
2. Place the almonds on a baking sheet and spread them out evenly.
3. Bake the almonds in the preheated oven for about 10 minutes, or until they are dry and slightly toasted. Remove from the oven and set aside.
4. In a saucepan, combine the sugar with 100ml of water. Heat over medium heat, stirring constantly, until the sugar has dissolved and the mixture comes to a boil.
5. Reduce the heat to low and continue to cook the sugar syrup for about 5 minutes, until it reaches a smooth consistency.
6. Using a large spoon or ladle, carefully pour a quarter of a pint (approximately 120ml) of the sugar syrup over the almonds. Stir and turn the almonds with your hand to coat them evenly.
7. Allow the almonds to rest for a few minutes to dry slightly, then repeat the process of pouring the sugar syrup over the almonds and stirring until coated. You can repeat this step as many times as you like, depending on how much sugar coating you prefer.
8. Once the almonds are coated to your liking, allow them to cool completely and dry completely before serving or storing.
