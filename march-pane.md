# March-pane

## Description
March-pane is a traditional almond-based sweet treat that was popular in the 18th century. It is made by grinding almonds into a paste and combining it with clarified sugar. The mixture is then shaped into various forms and baked until golden. Once cooled, the march-pane can be iced for added sweetness.

## Options and commentary
- You can add flavorings such as vanilla extract or almond extract to enhance the taste of the march-pane.
- You can decorate the march-pane with colored icing or sprinkles for a more festive look.

## Ingredients:
- 200g almonds
- 100g clarified sugar
- 1 egg white
- Powdered sugar (for dusting)
- Optional: flavorings such as vanilla extract or almond extract
- Optional: colored icing or sprinkles for decoration

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F).
2. Place the almonds in a heatproof bowl and pour boiling water over them. Let them sit for a few minutes, then drain and rinse with cold water.
3. Remove the skins from the almonds by gently squeezing them between your fingers. The skins should easily slip off.
4. Pat the almonds dry with a clean kitchen towel.
5. Place the almonds in a food processor or blender and grind them until they form a fine powder. Alternatively, you can use a mortar and pestle to grind the almonds.
6. In a separate bowl, whisk the egg white until frothy.
7. Gradually add the ground almonds to the egg white, mixing well after each addition. The mixture should come together to form a sticky paste.
8. In a saucepan, heat the clarified sugar over medium heat until it reaches the feather stage. To test if it's ready, dip a spoon into the sugar syrup and let it cool slightly. If the syrup forms thin threads that resemble feathers when you lift the spoon, it's done.
9. Carefully pour the hot sugar syrup into the almond paste, stirring continuously with a spatula to combine. Be cautious as the mixture will be very hot.
10. Once the mixture is well combined, transfer it onto a surface dusted with powdered sugar.
11. Allow the mixture to cool slightly, then knead it gently until it becomes smooth and pliable.
12. Roll out the almond paste to your desired thickness. You can use a rolling pin to achieve an even thickness.
13. Cut the almond paste into various shapes using cookie cutters or a sharp knife. You can make them round, long, oval, jagged, or heart-shaped.
14. Place the shaped march-pane on baking sheets lined with parchment paper.
15. Bake the march-pane in the preheated oven for about 10-12 minutes, or until they turn golden brown.
16. Remove the baked march-pane from the oven and let them cool completely on a wire rack.
17. If desired, you can decorate the march-pane with colored icing or sprinkles at this stage.
18. Once the icing has set, store the march-pane in an airtight container.
