## Ingredients:
- 1 hare
- Marrow from an ox marrow-bone
- 1 onion, finely chopped
- 1 shallot, finely chopped
- Savory, a small amount, finely chopped
- Thyme, a small amount, finely chopped
- Parsley, a small amount, finely chopped
- Salt, to taste
- Nutmeg, to taste
- Butter, for stuffing and basting
- Cream, for basting
- Claret wine, for sauce
- 1 anchovy
- 1 blade of mace

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F).
2. In a bowl, combine the ox marrow, onion, shallot, savory, thyme, parsley, salt, and nutmeg. Mix well to combine.
3. Take a piece of butter and roll it up in the mixture from step 2. This will be the stuffing for the hare.

5. Spit the hare and place it on a roasting pan.

9. Once the hare is roasted enough, remove it from the oven and take out the pudding from its belly.
10. Wash the hare all over with butter.
