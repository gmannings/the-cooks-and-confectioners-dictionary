# Boiling Sugar to its Feathered Duality

## Description
This recipe describes the process of boiling sugar to its feathered quality. When the sugar reaches this stage, it forms thick and large bubbles that rise up on high. Eventually, the bubbles become thicker and stick together, forming a flying flake-like texture.

## Ingredients:
- Granulated sugar

## Instructions:
1. In a heavy-bottomed saucepan, add the granulated sugar.
2. Place the saucepan over medium heat.
3. Stir the sugar continuously using a wooden spoon until it starts to melt.
4. Once the sugar has completely melted, stop stirring and allow it to boil.
5. As the sugar boils, you will notice bubbles forming on the surface. 
6. After some time, blow through a skimmer or shake a spatula with a backstroke to test the consistency of the sugar.
7. If the bubbles that rise up are thicker and larger, the sugar has reached its feathered quality.
8. Continue boiling the sugar until you achieve the desired feathered texture.
9. To test if the sugar is greatly feathered, perform several trials and observe if the bubbles become thicker and stick together, forming a flying flake-like texture.

## Cooking time
The cooking time may vary depending on the heat and the desired feathered texture. It is recommended to keep a close eye on the sugar while boiling and perform multiple trials to determine the ideal cooking time.
