# Another Way Cheesecake

## Description
This recipe is a variation of a traditional cheesecake made with cheese curds, butter, almonds, and eggs. It has a rich and creamy texture with a hint of almond flavor.

## Options and commentary
- You can use any type of cheese curds, such as cottage cheese or ricotta, as a substitute for the traditional curds.
- If you don't have orange-flower water, you can use almond extract or vanilla extract instead.
- You can use a store-bought puff pastry crust or make your own from scratch.

## Ingredients:
- 680g cheese curds
- 280g butter, softened
- 115g almonds
- 1 tablespoon orange-flower water
- 225g sugar
- 8 eggs
- 60ml cream
- 1/4 teaspoon ground mace
- 1 puff pastry crust

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 180Â°C.
2. In a large bowl, beat the cheese curds and butter together until well combined and the mixture resembles butter.
3. In a separate bowl, grind the almonds until fine. Add the orange-flower water to the ground almonds and mix well.
4. Add the almond mixture, sugar, eggs (leaving out half of the whites), cream, and ground mace to the cheese curd mixture. Beat everything together for about 15 minutes until well combined and smooth.
5. Roll out the puff pastry crust and line a greased pie dish with it.
6. Pour the cheesecake mixture into the prepared crust.
7. Bake in the preheated oven for about 1 hour, or until the cheesecake is set and golden brown on top.
8. Remove from the oven and let it cool completely before serving.
