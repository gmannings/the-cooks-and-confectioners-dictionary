# Baked Rabbit in a Casserole

## Description
This recipe is for a traditional dish of baked rabbit, cooked in a casserole. The rabbit is first divided into quarters and then larded with thick bacon lardons. It is then fried in lard or butter before being stewed in a flavorful broth with white wine, salt, pepper, sweet herbs, fried flour, and orange.

## Options and commentary
- Instead of rabbit, you can use chicken or any other meat of your choice.
- If you prefer a lighter dish, you can use olive oil instead of lard or butter for frying.
- You can adjust the seasoning according to your taste preferences.
