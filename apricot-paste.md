# Apricot Paste

## Description
Apricot paste is a sweet and fruity confection made from ripe apricots and sugar. It has a smooth and sticky texture, similar to fruit leather or fruit roll-ups.

## Ingredients:
- 500g ripe apricots
- 500g double refined sugar
- Water

## Instructions:
1. Bring a pot of water to a boil.
2. Place the apricots in the boiling water for about 1 minute to blanch them.
3. Remove the apricots from the boiling water and immediately transfer them to a bowl of ice water to cool.
4. Once cooled, peel off the skins of the apricots.
5. Cut the apricots in half and remove the stones.
6. In a separate pot, combine the sugar with enough water to wet it and create a syrup.
7. Place the pot with the sugar syrup on the stove and bring it to a boil.
8. Continue boiling the syrup until it reaches the candy stage. To test if the syrup has reached the candy stage, drop a small amount into a bowl of cold water. It should form a soft ball that holds its shape but is still pliable.
9. Add the apricot pulp to the boiling syrup and stir well to combine.
10. Allow the mixture to boil briskly for a few minutes, stirring constantly to prevent sticking or burning.
11. Remove the pot from the heat and let the mixture cool slightly.
12. Pour the apricot paste into glass jars or molds.
13. Place the jars or molds in a cool, dry place, such as a pantry or cupboard, to set and dry. Alternatively, you can use a food dehydrator or a low-temperature oven to speed up the drying process.
14. Once the apricot paste is completely cooled and set, it is ready to be enjoyed.
