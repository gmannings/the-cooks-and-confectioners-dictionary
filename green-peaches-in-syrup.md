# Green Peaches in Syrup

## Description
Green Peaches in Syrup is a preserved fruit dish made from unripe peaches that are scalded, peeled, and cooked in a sweet syrup. The peaches are then dried to create a chewy and sweet treat.

## Ingredients:
- 4-6 unripe peaches
- Water
- Wood ash (or substitute with food-grade lye)
- Sugar

## Instructions:
1. Fill a large pan with fresh water and add wood ash (or food-grade lye) to create a lye solution. Remove any coals that rise to the top.
2. Boil the lye solution for some time until it becomes sweet and oily in taste.
3. Remove the pan from the heat and let it settle. Carefully pour off the clear liquid, leaving behind any sediment.
4. Place the clear liquid back on the heat and bring it to a boil.
5. Add three to four peaches to the boiling liquid. If the peaches are cleansed and softened, add the remaining peaches. Stir the liquid occasionally to prevent boiling.
6. Once the peaches are sufficiently scalded, remove them from the liquid and shake them in a cloth to remove excess moisture.
7. Wash the peaches in fresh water to remove any remaining lye solution.
8. Use a knitting needle to pierce the peaches through the middle.
9. Place the pierced peaches in another container of fresh water to restore their green color.
10. Transfer the peaches to a pot of water and boil them over high heat. Test the peaches by pricking them with a pin. If they slide off easily, they are done. If they stick, continue boiling.
11. Once the peaches are cooked, remove them from the boiling water and place them in cold water to stop the cooking process.
12. Drain the peaches and repeat the process of placing them in fresh water to regain their green color.
13. In a separate pot, heat water and add fine sugar. Use a ratio of two ladlefuls of clarified sugar to one ladleful of water.
14. Once the sugar mixture is heated, add the peaches and bring to a gentle boil. Skim off any impurities that rise to the surface.
15. Allow the peaches to simmer in the syrup for a while, then remove them and let them sit for a day.
16. On the third day, boil the syrup until it reaches a smooth consistency. Add more sugar to increase the quantity of syrup.
17. Return the peaches to the syrup and simmer for a while longer. Leave them to soak until the next day.
18. Boil the syrup again until it reaches a pearl-like consistency. Increase the sugar quantity to match the syrup's quality.
19. Add the peaches to the syrup and give them a covered boil.
20. Remove the pan from the heat and skim off any impurities.
21. Allow the peaches to dry in a warm place overnight to remove excess moisture.
22. The next day, arrange the peaches on slates, tiles, or similar surfaces. Sprinkle them with sugar and dry them in a low-temperature oven or dehydrator until they are chewy and no longer sticky.

## Cooking time
Approximately 3 days, including drying time.
