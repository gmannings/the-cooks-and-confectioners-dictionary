# Ratafia White

## Description
Ratafia White is a sweet and fragrant liqueur that was popular in the 18th century. It is made by boiling a mixture of water, sugar, spices, and white pepper, then clarifying the sugar with egg whites. After boiling, brandy is added for flavor, and the mixture is strained to remove any solids. Additional fragrant notes can be added with the juice of white strawberries or raspberries, or with orange flowers.

## Options and commentary
- Instead of using a rag to tie up the spices, you can use a spice bag or cheesecloth.
- If you prefer a stronger flavor, you can boil the mixture until more than one third of the liquid has evaporated.
- The addition of fruit juice or orange flowers is optional and can be adjusted to personal preference.

## Ingredients:
- 11 liters of water
- 3 kg of sugar
- 75 g of cinnamon
- 5 nutmegs
- 10 cloves
- 5 g of mace
- 5 g of ginger
- 5 g of white pepper
- 2 egg whites
- 3 liters of brandy
- Juice of white strawberries or raspberries (optional)
- Orange flowers (optional)

## Instructions:
1. In a large pot, combine the water, sugar, cinnamon, nutmegs, cloves, mace, ginger, and white pepper. Tie the spices in a spice bag or wrap them in cheesecloth to make it easier to remove later.
2. Place the pot over medium heat and bring the mixture to a boil. Stir occasionally to dissolve the sugar.
3. In a separate bowl, whisk the egg whites until frothy.
4. Once the mixture is boiling, add the frothy egg whites to the pot. This will help clarify the sugar and remove any impurities. Skim off any foam that rises to the surface.
5. Continue boiling the mixture until approximately one third of the liquid has evaporated. This will concentrate the flavors. Alternatively, you can boil it longer if you prefer a stronger flavor.
6. Remove the pot from the heat and let it cool slightly.
7. Stir in the brandy and mix well.
8. Place a straining bag or a fine sieve over a clean container. Pour the mixture through the straining bag or sieve to remove any solids.
9. If desired, add the juice of white strawberries or raspberries to give the ratafia a fruity aroma. Alternatively, you can add a few drops of orange flower water for a floral note.
10. Transfer the strained ratafia to bottles or jars and seal tightly.
11. Store the ratafia in a cool, dark place for at least a week to allow the flavors to meld together. It can be enjoyed immediately, but the flavors will continue to develop over time.
