# Dressed Pigeons à la Saignare

## Description
Dressed Pigeons à la Saignare is a classic 18th-century dish that involves roasting pigeons and serving them with a flavorful bacon sauce. The pigeons are larded with bacon, roasted until tender, and then served with a rich sauce made from bacon, flour, gravy, vinegar, and herbs.

## Options and commentary
- Instead of larding the pigeons, you can wrap them in bacon slices before roasting.
- You can use chicken or Cornish game hens as a substitute for pigeons.
- Adjust the amount of vinegar and cullis (a type of sauce) according to your taste preferences.

## Ingredients:
- 4 pigeons
- 8 slices of bacon
- 2 tablespoons flour
- 1 cup good quality gravy
- 2 tablespoons vinegar
- 1 faggot of sweet herbs (such as thyme, parsley, and bay leaves)
- Salt and pepper to taste

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F).
2. Lard the pigeons by inserting strips of bacon into the breast meat. Alternatively, wrap each pigeon with 2 slices of bacon.
3. Place the larded pigeons on a roasting rack and season with salt and pepper.
4. Roast the pigeons in the preheated oven for about 30-40 minutes or until the internal temperature reaches 74°C (165°F).
5. While the pigeons are roasting, prepare the sauce. In a saucepan, cook the remaining slices of bacon until crispy. Remove the bacon from the pan and set aside.
6. In the same saucepan, add the flour to the bacon fat and cook over medium heat, stirring constantly, until the flour turns golden brown.
7. Gradually whisk in the gravy, making sure there are no lumps.
8. Add the faggot of sweet herbs to the saucepan and simmer for about 10 minutes to allow the flavors to meld.
9. Stir in the vinegar and season with salt and pepper to taste.
10. Remove the faggot of herbs from the sauce.
11. Once the pigeons are cooked, remove them from the oven and let them rest for a few minutes.
12. Quarter the pigeons and arrange them on a serving platter.
13. Remove the fat from the cooked bacon slices and place them on top of the pigeons.
14. Pour the sauce over the pigeons and bacon.
15. Serve the dressed pigeons à la saignare immediately.
