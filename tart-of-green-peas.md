# Tart of Green Peas

## Description
This recipe is for a savory tart made with fresh green peas. The peas are boiled until tender, seasoned with salt and saffron, and then mixed with sweet butter and sugar. The mixture is then filled into a tart shell, baked until golden, and finished with a splash of verjuice. The tart is then iced with sugar and served.

## Ingredients:
- 500g fresh green peas
- Salt, to taste
- A pinch of saffron
- 50g sweet butter
- 50g sugar
- 1 pre-made tart shell
- A splash of verjuice (or substitute with lemon juice)
- Additional sugar, for icing

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 180Â°C.
2. In a large pot, bring water to a boil and add the fresh green peas. Boil the peas until they are tender.
3. Drain the peas in a colander and season them with salt and saffron.
4. Add the sweet butter and sugar to the peas and mix well to combine.
5. Fill the pre-made tart shell with the pea mixture, ensuring it is evenly distributed.
6. Close the tart by placing another layer of pastry on top and sealing the edges.
7. Place the tart in the preheated oven and bake for approximately 1 hour, or until the crust is golden brown.
8. Once the tart is cooked, remove it from the oven and carefully pour in a little verjuice (or lemon juice). Shake the tart gently to distribute the liquid.
9. Allow the tart to cool slightly, then sprinkle with additional sugar to create an icing effect.
