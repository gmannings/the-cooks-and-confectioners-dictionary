# Fricasseed Ducks

## Description
Fricasseed ducks are a classic dish where quartered ducks are fried and then simmered in a flavorful sauce. The ducks are cooked until tender and served with a rich and creamy sauce.

## Ingredients:
- 2 ducks, quartered
- Salt and pepper, to taste
- 4 tablespoons butter
- 1 cup onions, finely shredded
- 1 teaspoon thyme
- 1 cup claret (red wine)
- 4 slices bacon, thinly sliced
- 1 cup parsley, chopped
- 1 cup spinach, chopped
- 3 egg yolks
- 1/4 teaspoon pepper
- 1/4 teaspoon grated nutmeg
- 1 cup drawn butter (clarified butter)

## Instructions:
1. Season the duck quarters with salt and pepper.
2. In a large skillet, melt the butter over medium heat.
3. Add the duck quarters to the skillet and fry them until they are almost cooked through and golden brown on all sides. Remove the duck quarters from the skillet and set them aside.
4. In the same skillet, add the shredded onions and thyme. Cook until the onions are softened and lightly browned.
5. Pour in the claret and bring it to a simmer. Let it cook for a few minutes to reduce slightly.
6. Add the sliced bacon, parsley, and spinach to the skillet. Cook until the bacon is crispy and the spinach is wilted.
7. In a separate bowl, whisk together the egg yolks, pepper, and grated nutmeg.
8. Gradually add the drawn butter to the egg yolk mixture, whisking constantly to prevent curdling.
9. Return the duck quarters to the skillet and pour the egg yolk mixture over them. Toss everything together gently to coat the duck quarters with the sauce.
10. Arrange the bacon slices on top of the duck quarters.
11. Serve the fricasseed ducks hot.
