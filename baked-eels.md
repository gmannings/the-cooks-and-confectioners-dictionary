# Baked Eels

## Description
This recipe is for baking eels in a flavorful herb and spice mixture. The eels are cooked in a shallow pot in the oven and then served with a butter and white wine sauce.

## Ingredients:
- 2 eels, cleaned and stripped
- Water
- Salt
- Pepper
- 2 shallots, finely chopped
- 1 tablespoon fresh sage, chopped
- 1 tablespoon fresh marjoram
- 1 tablespoon fresh rosemary tops
- 1 tablespoon fresh thyme
- 2 tablespoons butter
- 1/4 cup white wine

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F).
2. Cut the eels into lengths that will fit in a shallow pot.
3. In the pot, arrange the eel pieces so that they stand end-ways.
4. Add enough water to the pot to cover the bottom.
5. Sprinkle salt, pepper, chopped shallots, sage, marjoram, rosemary tops, and thyme over the eels.
6. Place the pot in the preheated oven and bake for about 30 minutes, or until the eels are cooked through and tender.
7. While the eels are baking, prepare the sauce. In a small saucepan, melt the butter over low heat.
8. Once the butter has melted, add the liquid that comes from the eels and the white wine to the saucepan.
9. Increase the heat to medium and cook the sauce until it thickens slightly, stirring occasionally.
10. Once the eels are baked, remove them from the oven and transfer them to a serving dish.
11. Pour the butter and white wine sauce over the eels.
12. Serve the baked eels hot.
