# Salt-fish a la Montizeur

## Description
Salt-fish a la Montizeur is a dish made with minced carp and salted fish, baked in the oven with a buttery sauce. It is a rich and flavorful dish that can be served as a main course.

## Options and commentary
- Instead of carp, you can use any firm white fish such as cod or haddock.
- If you prefer a milder flavor, you can reduce the amount of nutmeg and pepper.
- You can add other herbs and spices such as parsley or garlic for additional flavor.

## Ingredients:
- 1 carp fillet (or any firm white fish)
- 200g salted fish (such as cod or haddock)
- 5-6 whole onions
- 100g butter
- 2-4 rolls, soaked in milk until thick
- 1/2 teaspoon nutmeg
- 1/2 teaspoon pepper
- 100g fresh butter
- Oysters (optional)
- 50g grated bread

For the sauce:
- 50g butter
- 100ml milk
- 1/4 teaspoon nutmeg

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 180Â°C.
2. Pick the flesh of the carp fillet from the bones and remove the skin. Mince it finely.
3. In a stew-pan, melt the butter over medium heat. Add the whole onions and cook until softened.
4. Add the minced carp to the stew-pan. Season with nutmeg and pepper. Cook for a few minutes until the fish is cooked through.
5. While the carp is cooking, boil the salted fish until tender. Pick the flesh from the skin and bones and mince it finely.
6. In a separate bowl, mix the minced salted fish with the soaked rolls and fresh butter. Add nutmeg to taste.
7. Spread the salted fish mixture on a baking dish, forming a layer that is as long as the size of the dish allows.
8. Place the whole cod fillet in the middle of the dish, on top of the minced fish mixture.
9. Surround the cod fillet with more of the minced fish mixture.
10. If using oysters, place them on top of the minced fish mixture around the cod fillet.
11. Pour melted butter over the dish and sprinkle grated bread on top.
12. Cover the dish with a baking cover or foil and place it in the preheated oven.
13. Bake for about 30 minutes, or until the fish is cooked through and the bread topping is golden brown.

For the sauce:
1. In a small saucepan, melt the butter over low heat.
2. Add the milk and nutmeg to the saucepan. Stir well to combine.
3. Pour a little of the sauce over the baked fish when it comes out of the oven.
4. Serve the remaining sauce in a separate dish, as a dipping sauce.
