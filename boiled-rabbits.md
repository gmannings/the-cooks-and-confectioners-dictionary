# Boiled Rabbits

## Description
This recipe is for boiled rabbits, which are first pricked and then boiled until cooked. The rabbits are then served with a flavorful sauce made from their livers, bacon, white wine, strong broth, vinegar, mace, barberries, parsley, and drawn butter. The dish is garnished with barberries and slices of lemon.

## Ingredients:
- 2 rabbits
- Bacon, for larding
- 100g fat bacon, boiled and minced
- 100ml white wine
- 100ml strong broth
- 50ml vinegar
- 2 whole mace
- 50g barberries
- 1 tablespoon minced parsley
- 1 ladleful of drawn butter
- Sippets (small pieces of toasted bread)
- Barberries and lemon slices, for garnish

## Instructions:
1. Prick the rabbits down to their shoulders and gather up their hind legs to their bellies.
2. Lard the rabbits with bacon, if desired.
3. Place the rabbits in a large pot and cover with water.
4. Bring the water to a boil and then reduce the heat to a simmer.
5. Cook the rabbits until they are tender and fully cooked, about 1-2 hours.
6. While the rabbits are boiling, prepare the sauce. In a separate saucepan, combine the minced bacon, white wine, strong broth, vinegar, whole mace, barberries, and minced parsley.
7. Simmer the sauce mixture for about 10 minutes to allow the flavors to meld together.
8. Add the ladleful of drawn butter to the sauce and stir until well combined.
9. Once the rabbits are cooked, remove them from the pot and place them on sippets.
10. Pour the sauce over the rabbits.
