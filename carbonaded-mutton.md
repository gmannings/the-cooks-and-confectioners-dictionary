# Carbonaded Mutton

## Description
Carbonaded Mutton is a hearty and flavorful dish made with tender mutton steaks that are fried and then stewed in a rich broth. The dish is seasoned with a combination of spices, mushrooms, chestnuts, and sweet herbs, which add depth of flavor. The sauce is thickened with fried flour, giving it a velvety texture. The dish is garnished with crispy fried bread and mushrooms, and served with a tangy sauce made from lemon juice and capers.

## Ingredients:
- 500g mutton steaks
- 2 tablespoons lard or vegetable oil
- 500ml good quality broth (beef or vegetable)
- Salt, to taste
- Pepper, to taste
- 4 cloves
- 100g mushrooms, sliced
- 100g chestnuts, peeled and halved
- 1 bunch of fresh sweet herbs (such as thyme, rosemary, and parsley)
- 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
- 4 slices of bread, cut into cubes
- Lemon juice, to taste
- 2 tablespoons capers

## Instructions:
1. Heat the lard or vegetable oil in a large frying pan over medium-high heat.
2. Season the mutton steaks with salt and pepper.
3. Fry the mutton steaks in the hot oil until browned on both sides. Remove from the pan and set aside.
4. In the same pan, add the mushrooms and chestnuts. Cook until the mushrooms are golden brown and the chestnuts are slightly softened.
5. Return the mutton steaks to the pan with the mushrooms and chestnuts.
6. Add the cloves, sweet herbs, and broth to the pan. Bring to a simmer.
7. Reduce the heat to low and cover the pan. Let the mutton simmer for about 1 hour, or until tender.
8. In a separate small frying pan, heat a tablespoon of lard or vegetable oil over medium heat.
9. Add the flour to the hot oil and cook, stirring constantly, until the flour turns golden brown and has a nutty aroma.
10. Gradually add the fried flour to the simmering broth, stirring constantly to avoid lumps. Cook for an additional 5 minutes to thicken the sauce.
11. In another small frying pan, heat a tablespoon of lard or vegetable oil over medium heat.
12. Fry the bread cubes in the hot oil until crispy and golden brown. Remove from the pan and set aside.
13. To serve, place the mutton steaks, mushrooms, and chestnuts on a serving dish. Pour the thickened sauce over the top.
14. Garnish with the fried bread cubes and additional fried mushrooms.
15. Drizzle with lemon juice and sprinkle with capers.
16. Serve hot and enjoy!
