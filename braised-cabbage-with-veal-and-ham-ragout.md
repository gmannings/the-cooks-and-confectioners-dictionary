# Braised Cabbage with Veal and Ham Ragout

## Description
This recipe is a modernized version of an 18th-century dish called "To dzels a Cabbage in a Ragoo." It features a cabbage that is blanched, braised, and then served with a flavorful veal and ham ragout. The cabbage becomes tender and absorbs the rich flavors of the ragout, making it a delicious side dish for roasted, boiled, or stewed meats.

## Ingredients:
- 1 medium-sized cabbage
- 200g veal, cut into small pieces
- 100g ham, cut into small pieces
- 500ml veal or beef broth
- 2 tablespoons butter
- 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
- Salt and pepper to taste

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 180Â°C.
2. Cut the cabbage in half and remove the core.
3. Blanch the cabbage halves in a pot of boiling water for 5 minutes.
4. Remove the cabbage from the pot and let it cool slightly.
5. Squeeze out any excess water from the cabbage halves.
6. Tie each cabbage half with kitchen twine to keep them together during cooking.
7. Heat a stew-pan over medium heat and melt the butter.
8. Add the veal and ham pieces to the stew-pan and cook until browned.
9. Pour in the veal or beef broth and bring it to a simmer.
10. Place the tied cabbage halves in the stew-pan and cover with a lid.
11. Transfer the stew-pan to the preheated oven and braise the cabbage for 1 hour or until tender.
12. Remove the stew-pan from the oven and take out the cabbage halves.
13. Cut the cabbage into thin slices and transfer them to a saucepan.
14. Place the saucepan over low heat and add some of the veal or beef broth to simmer.
15. In a separate small bowl, mix the flour with a little water to make a slurry.
16. Gradually add the slurry to the simmering broth, stirring constantly, until the sauce thickens.
17. Season the sauce with salt and pepper to taste.
18. Pour the thickened sauce over the sliced cabbage and stir to combine.
19. Serve the braised cabbage with the veal and ham ragout alongside roasted, boiled, or stewed meats.
