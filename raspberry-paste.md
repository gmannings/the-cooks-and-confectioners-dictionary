# Raspberry Paste

## Description
Raspberry Paste is a sweet confection made from raspberry juice and sugar. It has a chewy texture and a vibrant raspberry flavor. It can be enjoyed on its own as a candy or used as a topping or filling for desserts.

## Ingredients:
- 1 kg raspberries
- 1 kg double-refined sugar
- Water

## Instructions:
1. Place a fine cloth or cheesecloth over a strainer set over a bowl.
2. Pour the raspberries onto the cloth and press down firmly to extract the juice. Strain the juice into a saucepan, discarding the solids.
3. Place the saucepan with the raspberry juice on the stove and bring it to a boil over medium heat.
4. While the juice is boiling, weigh out an equal amount of double-refined sugar (1 kg) and set it aside.
5. Once the raspberry juice is boiling, add the sugar to the saucepan, along with enough water to wet the sugar. The amount of water needed will depend on the consistency of the sugar.
6. Stir the mixture continuously until the sugar has dissolved completely and the mixture reaches a candy-like consistency. This can be tested by dropping a small amount onto a plate. It should form a clear, crystal-like drop.
7. Once the sugar and raspberry juice are well-mixed, continue stirring and heat the mixture for a few more minutes, just until it reaches a gentle simmer.
8. Remove the saucepan from the heat and pour the mixture into small glass jars or molds, making sure the paste is no more than an inch thick.
9. Place the jars or molds on a warm surface, such as a stone or countertop, to allow the paste to set. It should become firm enough to cut.
10. Once the paste has set, gently turn it out onto glazed parchment paper.
11. Use a sharp knife or cookie cutters to cut the paste into desired shapes.
12. Place the cut pieces back on the warm surface and allow them to dry completely.

## Cooking time
Approximately 1-2 hours, depending on the time needed for the paste to set and dry.
