# Stewed Fish with White Wine

## Description
This recipe is for a stewed fish dish that is cooked in white wine and served with a rich and creamy sauce. The fish is flavored with cinnamon and mace, and served on sippets (small pieces of toasted bread). The sauce is thickened with eggs, butter, cream, and sugar, and garnished with boiled prunes, currants, lemon slices, barberries, and spices.

## Options and commentary
- You can use any firm white fish for this recipe, such as cod, haddock, or halibut.
- If you prefer a less sweet sauce, you can reduce the amount of sugar used.
- The garnishes are optional and can be adjusted to your taste.

## Ingredients:
- 1 fish fillet (about 200g)
- 250ml white wine
- Salt
- 1 cinnamon stick
- 2-3 whole mace blades
- Sippets (small pieces of toasted bread)
- 3-4 egg yolks
- 50g butter
- 100ml thick cream
- 2 tablespoons sugar
- Boiled prunes
- Currants
- Lemon slices
- Barberries (optional)
- Additional cinnamon and mace for garnish
- Sugar for sprinkling

## Instructions:
1. Clean and rinse the fish fillet.
2. In a stewpan, pour in the white wine until it covers the fish.
3. Place the stewpan on the stove and bring the wine to a boil.
4. Once boiling, carefully add the fish to the stewpan.
5. Skim off any impurities that rise to the surface.
6. Add salt, the cinnamon stick, and the mace blades to the stewpan.
7. Reduce the heat to low and let the fish simmer gently for about 10-15 minutes, or until cooked through.
8. While the fish is cooking, prepare the sippets by toasting small pieces of bread until crisp.
9. Once the fish is cooked, remove it from the stewpan and place it on a serving dish lined with the sippets.
10. Strain the fish broth from the stewpan into a separate bowl, discarding the cinnamon stick and mace blades.
11. In a separate bowl, whisk together the egg yolks, butter, cream, and sugar until well combined.
12. Gradually pour the strained fish broth into the egg yolk mixture, whisking constantly to prevent curdling.
13. Pour the mixture back into the stewpan and place it over low heat.
14. Cook the sauce, stirring constantly, until it thickens to a creamy consistency.
15. Once the sauce has thickened, remove it from the heat.
16. Pour the sauce over the fish and sippets on the serving dish.
17. Garnish the dish with boiled prunes, currants, lemon slices, barberries (if using), and a sprinkle of cinnamon, mace, and sugar.
