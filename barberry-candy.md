# Barberry Candy

## Description
This recipe is for making a sweet and tart candy using ripe barberries and sugar. The barberries are cooked in a syrup made from sugar and water, and then mixed with the clear juice extracted from some of the barberries. The candy is boiled quickly to preserve its color.

## Ingredients:
- 500g ripe barberries
- 675g fine powdered sugar
- Water

## Instructions:
1. Remove any stems or leaves from the barberries and rinse them well.
2. Place the barberries in a dish and sprinkle some of the powdered sugar over them.
3. In a saucepan, combine the remaining powdered sugar with enough water to make a high syrup.
4. Bring the syrup to a boil over medium heat, stirring occasionally to dissolve the sugar completely.
5. While the syrup is boiling, take a portion of the barberries and crush them to extract their juice. Strain the juice to remove any solids.
6. Measure the clear juice obtained and add an equal weight of sugar to it.
7. Once the syrup has reached the desired consistency (it should be thick and sticky), add the crushed barberry juice and the additional sugar to the saucepan.
8. Stir well to combine all the ingredients.
9. Increase the heat to high and bring the mixture to a rapid boil, stirring constantly to prevent burning.
10. Boil the candy mixture for a few minutes, making sure it does not lose its color.
11. Remove the saucepan from the heat and let the candy cool slightly.
12. While the candy is still warm and pliable, shape it into small bite-sized pieces or roll it into balls.
13. Place the candy on a parchment-lined baking sheet to cool and harden completely.
