# Orange Pudding

## Description
Orange Pudding is a sweet and tangy dessert made with oranges, sugar, and orange-flower water. It has a creamy texture and is often served chilled. This recipe provides instructions on how to make the pudding and suggests browning it for added flavor.

## Options and commentary
- You can use fresh oranges or orange juice for this recipe. If using fresh oranges, you will need to extract the juice and zest.
- Orange-flower water can be found in specialty stores or online. If you can't find it, you can substitute with orange extract, but the flavor will be slightly different.
- Browning the pudding with a red hot fire-shovel is optional and can be skipped if desired.

## Ingredients:
