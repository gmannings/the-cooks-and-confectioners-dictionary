# Artichoke Pie

## Description
This recipe is for a savory pie made with artichokes. The artichokes are boiled and then seasoned with mace, salt, and sugar. They are layered with butter, grated marrow mixed with egg yolks, gooseberries or grapes, mace, stoned dates, hard-boiled egg yolks, suckers (presumably shoots or sprouts), lettuce stalks, and citron. The pie is then covered with butter and baked. After baking, scalded white wine is added and the pie is shaken before serving.

## Options and commentary
- Instead of grated marrow, you can use grated zucchini or yellow squash as a modern alternative.
- If gooseberries or grapes are not available, you can use other tart fruits like cranberries or currants.
- Suckers can be replaced with young shoots of vegetables like asparagus or green beans.
- Citron can be substituted with lemon or orange zest.
