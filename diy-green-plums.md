# DIY Green Plums

## Description
This recipe is for making green plums that are preserved in a sugar syrup. The plums are parboiled, peeled, and then cooked in a sugar syrup until tender. They are then drained and coated in powdered sugar. The plums are left to sit in the syrup for 24 hours before the syrup is boiled again. This process is repeated daily until the plums have absorbed all the syrup. Finally, the plums are dried and shaped to resemble plums, with a hole in the middle where a plum stone is placed.

## Ingredients:
- Green plums
- Water
- Sugar
- Powdered sugar

## Instructions:
1. Bring a pot of water to a boil.
2. Add the green plums to the boiling water and cook for a few minutes until the skins start to loosen.
3. Remove the plums from the boiling water and immediately place them in a bowl of ice water to cool.
4. Once the plums are cool enough to handle, peel off the skins.
5. In a separate pot, prepare a thin sugar syrup by combining sugar and water. The ratio of sugar to water should be about 1:1.
6. Bring the sugar syrup to a boil and skim off any impurities that rise to the surface.
7. Add the peeled plums to the boiling syrup and cook them until they are tender. This may take around 10-15 minutes.
8. Remove the plums from the syrup and place them on wire grates to drain.
9. Weigh the plums and coat them in an equal weight of powdered sugar. Make sure the plums are evenly coated.
10. Transfer the plums to an earthen basin and let them sit in the syrup for 24 hours, turning them occasionally.
11. After 24 hours, pour the syrup into a copper pan and bring it to a boil.
12. As soon as the syrup boils, remove it from the heat and add the plums back in. 
13. Repeat steps 10-12 daily until the plums have absorbed all the syrup. This may take several days.
14. Once the plums have absorbed all the syrup, remove them from the syrup and place them on glass plates.
15. Shape the plums to resemble real plums, making a hole in the middle with a plum stone.
16. Let the plums dry completely on the glass plates.
17. Once the plums are dry, place the plum stones in the holes and stack another half of a plum on top.
