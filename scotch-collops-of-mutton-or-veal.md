# Scotch Collops of Mutton or Veal

## Description
Scotch Collops of Mutton or Veal is a traditional Scottish dish made with thinly sliced and tenderized meat, cooked in a flavorful gravy and served with various accompaniments. The meat is fried and then simmered in a rich sauce made with anchovies, wine, butter, and eggs. It is typically served with crispy bacon, hard-boiled eggs, and fried sausage meat.

## Ingredients:
- 500g mutton or veal, thinly sliced
- Meat gravy (for frying)
- 2 anchovies, dissolved in a little claret (red wine)
- 30g butter
- 2-3 egg yolks, beaten
- Thin slices of fried bacon
- Hard-boiled eggs, sliced and fried
- Fried sausage meat

## Instructions:
1. Cut the mutton or veal into thin slices.
2. Place the slices between two sheets of plastic wrap and use a rolling pin to gently pound them to an even thickness.
3. Using the back of a knife, lightly score both sides of the meat slices.
4. Heat a frying pan over medium heat and add enough meat gravy to cover the bottom of the pan.
5. Fry the meat slices in the gravy until browned on both sides. Remove from the pan and set aside.
6. In a separate saucepan, dissolve the anchovies in a little claret (red wine).
7. Add the butter and beaten egg yolks to the saucepan with the dissolved anchovies.
8. Heat the saucepan over low heat, stirring constantly, until the sauce thickens and becomes smooth.
9. Place the fried meat slices in a serving dish and arrange them over a chafing dish of hot coals to keep warm.
10. Pour the sauce over the meat slices.
11. Fry thin slices of bacon until crispy and arrange them on top of the meat slices.
