# Eels with White Sauce

## Description
This recipe is for a classic dish of eels cooked in a white sauce. The eels are first skinned, cut into pieces, and then scalded. They are then seasoned with salt, pepper, cloves, cives, nutmeg, capers, bay leaf, and lemon. Artichoke bottoms, mushrooms, and asparagus tops are cooked with butter and herbs. A white sauce is made with egg yolks and verjuice. The dish is garnished with fried bread and lemon slices, and served with the juice of the lemon.

## Options and commentary
- Eels: Eels can be difficult to find in some regions. If eels are not available, you can substitute with another firm-fleshed fish such as cod or haddock.
- Verjuice: Verjuice is a sour juice made from unripe grapes. If you can't find verjuice, you can substitute with white wine or lemon juice.
