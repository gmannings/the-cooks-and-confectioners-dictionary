# Sea-Duck Pie

## Description
Sea-Duck Pie is a savory pie made with broiled sea-ducks that are stuffed with a flavorful mixture of livers, mushrooms, truffles, cives, parsley, butter, anchovy, and capers. The pie can be served either hot or cold, and can be accompanied by a ragout made with carp roe, crayfish tails, truffles, mushrooms, or oysters.

## Ingredients:
- 2 sea-ducks
- 200g chicken livers
- 100g mushrooms
- 50g truffles
- 2 cives (spring onions)
- 1 small bunch parsley
- 50g butter
- 1 anchovy fillet
- 1 tablespoon capers
- Pie crust (store-bought or homemade)
- Optional ragout ingredients:
  - 100g carp roe
  - 100g crayfish tails
  - 50g truffles
  - 50g mushrooms
  - 100g oysters

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 180°C.
2. Pluck and clean the sea-ducks, removing any feathers and innards. Rinse them thoroughly.
3. Lightly pound the sea-ducks on the breast to flatten them slightly.
4. Preheat a grill or grill pan. Grill the sea-ducks on both sides until they are cooked through. The internal temperature should reach 75°C. 
5. Tie the ends of the sea-ducks with kitchen twine to keep them in shape.
6. Finely chop the chicken livers, mushrooms, truffles, cives, parsley, anchovy, and capers.
7. In a pan, melt the butter over medium heat. Add the chopped ingredients and sauté until they are cooked through and fragrant.
8. Season the mixture with salt and pepper to taste.
9. Stuff the bodies of the sea-ducks with the prepared mixture.
10. Roll out the pie crust and line a pie dish with it.
11. Place the stuffed sea-ducks in the pie dish.
12. Cover the sea-ducks with another layer of pie crust, sealing the edges well.
13. Bake the sea-duck pie in the preheated oven for about 45 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown and the filling is cooked through.
14. If serving the pie hot, prepare a ragout by combining the optional ragout ingredients in a separate pan. Cook until the ingredients are heated through and well combined.
15. Serve the sea-duck pie hot with the prepared ragout on the side, or serve it cold without any accompaniments.

## Cooking time
Approximately 45 minutes for baking the pie. Additional time required for preparing the ragout if serving the pie hot.
