# Boiled Snipes

## Description
Boiled Snipes is a traditional dish made with small game birds called snipes. The snipes are boiled in a flavorful broth or water and salt, then served with a rich sauce made from the chopped snipe guts and liver, grated bread, broth, mace, eggs, wine-vinegar, nutmeg, butter, and various garnishes like capers, minced lemon, barberries, or pickled grapes. This dish is a delicious and elegant way to enjoy game birds.

## Ingredients:
- 4 snipes
- 4 cups strong broth or water
- Salt
- 1/2 cup grated bread
- 1/2 cup broth
- 1/2 teaspoon whole mace
- 2 egg yolks
- 1/4 cup wine vinegar
- 1/4 teaspoon grated nutmeg
- 2 tablespoons butter
- Sippets (small pieces of toasted bread)
- 2 tablespoons beaten butter
- Capers, minced lemon, barberries, or pickled grapes (for garnish)

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F).
2. In a large pot, bring the strong broth or water to a boil. Add a pinch of salt.
3. Clean the snipes by removing the guts. Chop the guts and liver into small pieces.
4. In a separate saucepan, combine the chopped guts and liver, grated bread, 1/2 cup of broth, and whole mace. Stew them together over low heat until the mixture thickens into a gravy-like consistency.
5. In a small bowl, dissolve the egg yolks in wine vinegar. Add the grated nutmeg.
6. When you are ready to serve the snipes, add the egg yolk mixture to the gravy and stir well. Add the butter and continue stirring until the sauce is smooth and creamy.
7. Place the snipes on sippets (small pieces of toasted bread) and pour the sauce over them.
8. Garnish with capers, minced lemon, barberries, or pickled grapes.
9. Serve immediately.
