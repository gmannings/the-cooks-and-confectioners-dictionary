# Swan Pye

## Description
Swan Pye is a traditional dish made with swan meat, seasoned with salt and pepper, and baked in a deep crust. The swan meat is first plucked, skinned, and boned, then parboiled and seasoned before being larded with strips of bacon. The pie is then baked until golden brown and served with melted butter poured over the top.

## Options and commentary
- If swan meat is not available, you can substitute it with chicken or turkey.
- The deep crust can be made with puff pastry or shortcrust pastry, depending on your preference.
- You can add additional herbs and spices to the seasoning, such as thyme or garlic, to enhance the flavor.
- Serve the Swan Pye with a side of roasted vegetables or a fresh salad for a complete meal.

## Ingredients:
- 1 swan (or substitute with chicken or turkey)
- Salt and pepper, to taste
- Strips of bacon, for larding
- Butter, for baking and serving
- Pastry dough (puff pastry or shortcrust pastry), enough to line a deep pie dish

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F).
2. Pluck the swan, removing all feathers.
3. Remove the skin from the swan, ensuring to remove any excess fat.
4. Bone the swan by carefully removing the bones, keeping the meat intact.
5. Parboil the swan meat by placing it in a pot of boiling water for 5-10 minutes. This will help remove any gamey taste.
6. Season the swan meat with salt and pepper, ensuring it is evenly coated.
7. Lard the swan meat by inserting strips of bacon into the meat, spacing them evenly.
8. Line a deep pie dish with the pastry dough, ensuring it covers the bottom and sides.
9. Place the seasoned and larded swan meat into the pie dish.
10. Add a generous amount of butter on top of the swan meat.
11. Cover the pie dish with a pastry lid, sealing the edges by crimping or pressing with a fork.
12. Place the Swan Pye in the preheated oven and bake for approximately 1.5-2 hours, or until the pastry is golden brown and the swan meat is cooked through.
13. While the pie is baking, melt some butter in a small saucepan.
14. Once the Swan Pye is baked, remove it from the oven and carefully pour the melted butter over the top of the pie using a funnel.
15. Allow the pie to cool slightly before serving.

## Cooking time
