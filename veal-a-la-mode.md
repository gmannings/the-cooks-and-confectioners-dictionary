# Veal a la Mode

## Description
Veal a la Mode is a classic French dish that involves marinating and braising a veal loin with a flavorful mixture of spices, herbs, and vegetables. The veal is then served with a rich sauce made from the cooking juices and a variety of garnishes.

## Options and commentary
- You can choose to either bake or pot the veal. Baking will result in a roasted texture, while potting will give it a more tender and moist consistency.
- The choice of garnishes for the sauce can vary depending on personal preference. Some traditional options include mushrooms, sweetbreads, cockscombs, and truffles. Alternatively, you can use cucumbers or lettuce for a lighter and fresher flavor.
- The dish can be served as a main course for a special occasion or as part of a multi-course meal.
