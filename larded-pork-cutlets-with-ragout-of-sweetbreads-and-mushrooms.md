# Larded Pork Cutlets with Ragout of Sweetbreads and Mushrooms

## Description
This recipe is a modernized version of an 18th-century dish. It features pork cutlets that are flattened, larded, and coated with breadcrumbs, salt, pepper, and parsley. The cutlets are then cooked in melted bacon fat and served with a flavorful ragout of sweetbreads and mushrooms. The dish is garnished with fried parsley for added visual appeal.

## Options and commentary
- Instead of pork loin, you can use pork chops or boneless pork loin chops.
- If you don't have access to sweetbreads, you can substitute with chicken or veal sweetbreads, or omit them altogether.
- Feel free to add other herbs or spices to the breadcrumb coating for additional flavor.
- The dish can be served with a side of roasted vegetables or mashed potatoes.

## Ingredients:
- 4 pork loin chops
- 4 slices of bacon
- 1 cup breadcrumbs
- Salt and pepper to taste
- 2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley
- 200g sweetbreads, cooked and sliced
- 200g mushrooms, sliced
- 2 tablespoons butter
- 2 tablespoons flour
- 1 cup chicken or vegetable broth
- Fried parsley for garnish

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F).
2. Place the pork loin chops on a cutting board and use a meat mallet or the back of a heavy knife to flatten them to an even thickness.
3. Cut small slits in the pork chops and insert small pieces of bacon into the slits. This is called larding.
4. In a shallow dish, combine the breadcrumbs, salt, pepper, and chopped parsley.
5. Dip each pork chop into the breadcrumb mixture, pressing the crumbs onto both sides to coat evenly.
6. In a large skillet, heat some bacon fat or cooking oil over medium heat. Add the breaded pork chops and cook for 3-4 minutes on each side until golden brown. Remove the pork chops from the skillet and transfer them to a baking dish.
7. In the same skillet, melt the butter over medium heat. Add the sliced mushrooms and cook until they are tender and lightly browned.
8. Sprinkle the flour over the mushrooms and stir well to coat. Cook for another minute to cook off the raw flour taste.
9. Slowly pour in the chicken or vegetable broth, stirring constantly to prevent lumps from forming. Cook until the sauce thickens.
10. Add the cooked and sliced sweetbreads to the mushroom sauce and stir to combine. Cook for an additional 2-3 minutes until the sweetbreads are heated through.
11. Pour the sweetbread and mushroom ragout over the pork chops in the baking dish.
12. Place the baking dish in the preheated oven and bake for 15-20 minutes until the pork chops are cooked through.
13. Remove the dish from the oven and garnish with fried parsley.
14. Serve the larded pork cutlets with the ragout of sweetbreads and mushrooms hot.
