# B20th Breakfast Soup

## Description
B20th Breakfast Soup is a hearty and flavorful soup made with a combination of beef, mutton, veal, and chicken. The meat is pounded and combined with soaked bread to create a thick and rich broth. This soup is perfect for a comforting breakfast or brunch.

## Ingredients:
- 1 chine of beef
- 1 crag-end of a neck of mutton
- 1 neck of veal
- 2 chickens
- 2 slices of bread
- 1 cup of broth (chicken or beef)
- Salt and pepper to taste

## Instructions:
1. In a large pot, add the chine of beef, crag-end of a neck of mutton, neck of veal, and chickens.
2. Fill the pot with enough water to cover the meat and bring it to a boil.
3. Reduce the heat to low and simmer for 2-3 hours, or until the meat is tender and cooked through.
4. Remove the meat from the pot and set it aside to cool.
5. In a mortar, pound the white meat or breasts of the chickens until they are finely minced.
6. In a separate bowl, soak the bread slices in the broth until they are soft.
7. Add the minced chicken and soaked bread to the mortar and continue pounding until well combined.
8. Pass the mixture through a sieve to remove any lumps and transfer it to a clean pot.
9. Take some of the simmering broth from the pot and pour it over the bread crusts laid in a separate pot.
10. Add the strained mixture to the pot with the bread crusts and bring it to a simmer.
11. Season with salt and pepper to taste.
12. Allow the soup to simmer for an additional 10-15 minutes to allow the flavors to meld together.
