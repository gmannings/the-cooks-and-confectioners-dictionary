# Roast Goose

## Description
This recipe is for roasting a goose and serving it with a flavorful sauce. The goose is first scotched and slashed, then washed with butter and seasoned with salt. It is then cooked in a frying pan before being finished on a grill. The roasted goose is basted with butter and coated with grated bread and flour before being frothed. The dish is served with a sauce made from butter, vinegar, mustard, and a little sugar, along with sausages and lemon.
