# Roasted Chub

## Description
Roasted Chub is a classic dish from the 18th century. It involves scaling and gutting the fish, filling it with herbs, and roasting it on a spit. The fish is basted with a mixture of vinegar and butter, seasoned with salt, which helps to enhance the flavor and remove excess moisture from the fish.

## Ingredients:
- 1 whole chub fish
- Fresh herbs (such as parsley, thyme, and rosemary)
- Vinegar
- Butter
- Salt

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F).
2. Scale the chub fish using a fish scaler or the back of a knife. Make sure to remove all the scales.
3. Make a small incision near the gills of the fish and gut it. Clean the throat well to remove any remaining innards.
4. Rinse the fish under cold water to remove any blood or impurities.
5. Pat the fish dry with paper towels.
6. Fill the belly of the fish with a handful of fresh herbs, such as parsley, thyme, and rosemary.
7. Tie the fish securely to a spit using kitchen twine or splinters.
8. Place the spit with the fish over a roasting pan or a grill rack set in a baking sheet.
9. Roast the chub fish in the preheated oven for about 20-25 minutes, or until the fish is cooked through and flakes easily with a fork.
10. While the fish is roasting, prepare the basting mixture. In a small saucepan, melt a knob of butter and add a splash of vinegar. Season the mixture with salt to taste.
11. Every 5 minutes, baste the fish with the vinegar and butter mixture using a basting brush. This will help to keep the fish moist and add flavor.
12. Once the fish is cooked, remove it from the oven and let it rest for a few minutes before serving.
