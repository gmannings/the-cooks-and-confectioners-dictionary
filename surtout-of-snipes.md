# Surtout of Snipes

## Description
Surtout of Snipes is a dish made with minced chicken, partridge, and pullet breasts, along with bacon, sweetbreads, mushrooms, truffles, and bread soaked in milk. These ingredients are minced together with cream cheese, herbs, and cream, and formed into balls. The balls are then arranged around the dish, and roasted snipes are placed on top of a bed of finely sliced cabbage lettuce. Anchovies are placed between the slices of snipes, and the dish is garnished with diced lemon, hard-boiled eggs, and small onions. The dish is then covered with the remaining minced mixture, baked until golden brown, and served hot as a first course.

## Options and commentary
- Instead of snipes, you can use any small game birds such as quail or woodcock.
- Feel free to adjust the herbs and seasonings to your taste.
- You can use any type of mushrooms and truffles that are available to you.
- If you don't have access to sweetbreads, you can omit them or substitute with another type of offal such as chicken livers.
- The dish can be served with a sauce of your choice, such as a red wine reduction or a creamy mushroom sauce.

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F).
2. In a large bowl, combine the minced chicken, partridge, and pullet breasts with the chopped bacon, sweetbreads, beef marrow, mushrooms, truffles, soaked French rolls, cream cheese, savory herbs, cream, and egg yolks. Season with salt and pepper to taste.
3. Shape the mixture into balls about the size of walnuts.
4. Dip each ball into the beaten egg, then roll in grated bread to coat. Place the coated balls around the rim of a greased baking dish.
5. Slice the cabbage lettuce into thin threads and spread a layer about an inch thick on the bottom of the baking dish.
6. Slice the roasted snipes into thin, three-inch long slices. Arrange the slices on top of the lettuce, with one end reaching the rim of the dish and the other end towards the center.
7. Place the sliced anchovies between the snipe slices.
8. In a separate bowl, combine the minced meat from the snipe legs with the diced lemon, minced hard-boiled eggs, and minced anchovies. Shape this mixture into a round heap in the center of the dish, resembling the top of a sugarloaf.
9. Garnish the dish with the boiled onions, placing the largest one in the middle of the minced meat heap and the rest around the rim of the dish.
10. Cover the dish with the remaining minced mixture, smoothing it over with beaten egg. Sprinkle grated bread on top.
11. Bake the dish in the preheated oven for about 30-40 minutes, or until it is golden brown.
12. Serve the Surtout of Snipes hot as a first course.
