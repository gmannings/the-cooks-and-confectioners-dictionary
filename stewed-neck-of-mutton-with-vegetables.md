# Stewed Neck of Mutton with Vegetables

## Description
This recipe is for a hearty and flavorful stew made with neck of mutton (lamb), vegetables, and a variety of herbs and spices. The meat is stewed until tender and then combined with parboiled cabbage, carrots, turnips, capers, and a mixture of sweet herbs. The stew is finished with a rich butter and flour sauce and served with sippets (small pieces of toasted bread). The dish is garnished with a squeeze of citrus juice for a refreshing touch.

## Options and commentary
- Instead of neck of mutton, you can use lamb shoulder or beef stew meat as a modern alternative.
- Feel free to adjust the amount of salt, pepper, and nutmeg to suit your taste.
- You can use any combination of vegetables you prefer, such as potatoes, peas, or green beans.
- If you don't have capers, you can omit them or substitute with chopped olives.
- The sweet herbs can include parsley, thyme, rosemary, or any other herbs you enjoy.
- Sippets can be replaced with crusty bread or served with mashed potatoes.

## Ingredients:
- 1 kg neck of mutton (or lamb shoulder or beef stew meat)
- Salt and pepper to taste
- 1/2 teaspoon nutmeg
- Water
- 1 small cabbage, parboiled and drained
- 2 carrots, parboiled and drained
- 2 turnips, parboiled and drained
- 1 handful capers
- 1 handful sweet herbs (such as parsley, thyme, rosemary)
- 2 anchovies, chopped
- 2 tablespoons butter
- 2 tablespoons flour
- 1 orange or lemon, juiced
- Sippets (small pieces of toasted bread) for serving

## Instructions:
1. Cut the neck of mutton into steaks.
2. Season the steaks with salt, pepper, and nutmeg.
3. Place the steaks in a stew-pan and add enough water to cover them.
4. Stew the steaks, skimming off any impurities that rise to the surface.
5. In the meantime, parboil the cabbage, carrots, and turnips until partially cooked. Drain them well.
6. When the steaks are halfway stewed, add the parboiled cabbage, carrots, and turnips to the stew-pan.
7. Add the capers, chopped sweet herbs, and chopped anchovies to the stew.
8. In a separate pan, brown the butter and then stir in the flour to make a roux.
9. Gradually add a ladle full of the broth from the stew-pan to the roux, stirring constantly to avoid lumps.
10. Bring the mixture to a boil and cook until thickened.
11. Pour the thickened sauce over the meat and vegetables in the stew-pan.
12. Let everything stew together for a little while longer until the meat is tender and the flavors have melded.
13. While the stew is finishing, toast the bread slices to make sippets.
14. Just before serving, squeeze the juice of one or two oranges or lemons over the stew.
15. Serve the stew in a dish with the sippets on the side.

## Cooking time
Approximately 2-3 hours, depending on the meat used and desired tenderness.
