# Baked Tench with a Pudding in the Belly

## Description
This recipe is for a baked tench (a type of fish) with a pudding filling. The fish is scalded, coated in a stiff pudding mixture, seasoned, and then baked. After baking, the pie is opened and filled with preserved orange. A sauce made with butter, vinegar, nutmeg, sugar, and egg yolk is poured over the pie before serving.

## Ingredients:
- 1 tench (substitute with any firm white fish, such as cod or haddock)
- 200 ml cream
- 100 g grated white bread
- 3 egg yolks
- 2 tbsp chopped fresh herbs (such as parsley or dill)
- 50 g currants, parboiled
- Salt and pepper to taste
- Nutmeg to taste
- 50 g butter
- Preserved orange, minced
- 2 tbsp vinegar
- 1 tbsp sugar

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 180Â°C.
2. Scald the tench by pouring boiling water over it, then remove the scales and clean it thoroughly.
3. Dry the tench with a cloth.
4. In a bowl, mix together the cream, grated white bread, egg yolks, chopped herbs, and parboiled currants. Season with salt, pepper, and nutmeg.
5. Stuff the belly of the tench with the pudding mixture.
6. Season the outside of the tench with salt, pepper, and nutmeg.
7. Place the butter in a baking dish and place the tench on top.
8. Cover the dish with a lid or foil and bake in the preheated oven for about 30 minutes, or until the fish is cooked through.
9. Remove the tench from the oven and carefully cut it open.
10. Sprinkle the minced preserved orange inside the pie.
11. In a small saucepan, melt the butter over low heat. Add the vinegar, sugar, and a pinch of nutmeg. Stir well.
12. In a separate bowl, beat the egg yolk. Slowly pour the butter and vinegar mixture into the beaten egg yolk, stirring constantly to prevent curdling.
13. Place the saucepan with the mixture over a low heat or a chafing dish of coals. Stir continuously until the sauce thickens slightly.
14. Pour the sauce over the tench pie, ensuring it is evenly distributed.
15. Shake the pie gently to mix the sauce and minced preserved orange.
16. Serve the baked tench with a pudding in the belly hot.
