# Stewed Young Chickens

## Description
This recipe is for stewed young chickens, which are cut into pieces and cooked in a flavorful broth until tender. The dish is seasoned with salt, pepper, and lemon juice for a tangy flavor. This recipe can also be used to stew partridges, rabbits, or veal.

## Ingredients:
- 3-4 young chickens
- Broth (enough to cover the chicken pieces)
- Salt
- Whole pepper
- Sallet-oil (salad oil)
- Lemon juice

## Instructions:
1. Oil the young chickens until they are half cooked. 
2. Remove the chickens from the oil and cut them into little pieces, separating the joint-bones from each other.
3. Cut the meat into slices.
4. Put the meat and bones (except the breast-bones) into a pot with a good quantity of the broth they were parboiled in.
5. Cover the pot with another dish and place it over a chafing dish of coals.
6. Let it stew until the chicken is tender, seasoning it with salt and whole pepper.
7. Add some sallet-oil to the stew.
8. Just before removing it from the heat, squeeze in the juice of a lemon to taste.
9. Serve the stewed chicken hot.

## Cooking time
Approximately 1-2 hours, depending on the size of the chicken pieces and the desired tenderness.
