# Boiled Flounders with Herbs

## Description
This recipe is for boiled flounders cooked with a flavorful mixture of herbs and spices. The fish is simmered in a broth made with white wine, water, and a variety of herbs including rosemary, thyme, winter savory, and sweet marjoram. The dish is then seasoned with salt, pepper, and verjuice (a sour juice made from unripe grapes) and served with a crust of manchet (a type of white bread) and butter.

## Ingredients:
- 4 flounders
- 1 bunch of fresh herbs (rosemary, thyme, winter savory, sweet marjoram)
- 1 small bunch of parsley
- 1/2 teaspoon whole mace
- 1 cup white wine
- 1 cup water
- 1/4 pound butter
- Salt and pepper to taste
- 2 tablespoons verjuice (or substitute with lemon juice)

## Instructions:
1. In a large pot, combine the white wine and water in equal quantities.
2. Add the fresh herbs (rosemary, thyme, winter savory, sweet marjoram), parsley, and whole mace to the pot.
3. Bring the mixture to a boil and let it simmer for about 15 minutes to infuse the flavors of the herbs.
4. Meanwhile, clean and prepare the flounders by removing the scales and gutting them.
5. Once the herb mixture has simmered, carefully add the flounders to the pot.
6. Skim off any impurities that rise to the surface of the broth.
7. Add a crust of manchet and the butter to the pot.
8. Season the broth with salt, pepper, and verjuice (or lemon juice).
9. Simmer the flounders in the broth for about 10-15 minutes, or until they are cooked through and tender.
10. Carefully remove the flounders from the pot and place them on a serving platter.
11. Strain the broth to remove the herbs and mace, then pour the broth over the flounders.
12. Serve the boiled flounders hot, with the broth and crust of manchet on the side.
