# Sweetened Cream with Almonds and Lemon

## Description
This recipe is a sweet and creamy dessert made with cream, almonds, lemon, and eggs. It is a rich and indulgent dish that is served cold.

## Ingredients:
- 1 liter of cream
- 150 grams of sugar
- 3-4 strips of lemon zest
- 1 cinnamon stick
- 200 grams of sweet almonds
- 20 bitter almonds
- Milk (for sprinkling)
- 15 egg yolks

## Instructions:
1. In a saucepan, combine the cream, sugar, lemon zest, and cinnamon stick. Heat the mixture over low heat until it starts to simmer. Remove from heat and let it cool for a few minutes.
2. In a mortar, pound the sweet almonds and bitter almonds until they form a paste. Sprinkle the almonds with a little milk while pounding to help them come together.
3. Add the almond paste to the cream mixture and stir well to combine.
4. In a separate bowl, whisk the egg yolks until they are well beaten.
5. Gradually add the beaten egg yolks to the cream and almond mixture, stirring constantly.
6. Strain the mixture through a sieve two or three times to ensure a smooth texture.
7. Pour the mixture into a dish and place it over low heat. Cover the dish and cook gently, stirring occasionally, until the mixture thickens. This should take about 15-20 minutes.
8. Once the mixture has thickened, remove it from the heat and let it cool. Transfer it to individual serving plates or bowls.
9. Refrigerate the dessert until it is completely chilled.
10. Serve the sweetened cream cold in plates.
