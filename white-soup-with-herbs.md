# White Soup with Herbs

## Description
This recipe is for a creamy and flavorful white soup with a combination of herbs. It is a light and refreshing dish that can be served as a starter or a light meal.

## Options and commentary
- You can use any combination of fresh herbs that you like, such as parsley, chervil, sorrel, and endive.
- If you don't have fresh herbs, you can use dried herbs, but reduce the amount by half.
- Instead of water from boiled peas, you can use vegetable or chicken broth for added flavor.
- You can adjust the tartness of the soup by adding lemon juice or vinegar to taste.

## Ingredients:
- 1/4 cup minced parsley
- 1/4 cup minced chervil
- 1 handful of sorrel, chopped
- 6 heads of endive, chopped
- 1 onion, finely chopped
- 1/4 cup butter
- 2 liters water or vegetable/chicken broth
- 6 egg yolks
- 1 nutmeg, grated
- Juice of 1/2 lemon (optional)
- 1 French roll, sliced and fried
- 6 poached eggs
- Fried bread cubes for garnish

## Instructions:
1. In a saucepan, melt the butter over medium heat.
2. Add the minced parsley, chervil, sorrel, endive, and onion to the saucepan. Cook for about 15 minutes, or until the herbs are tender.
3. Add the water or broth to the saucepan and bring to a simmer. Cook for another 10 minutes.
4. Skim off any fat that rises to the surface of the soup.
5. In a separate bowl, whisk the egg yolks until smooth.
6. Gradually add a ladleful of the hot soup to the egg yolks, whisking constantly to temper the yolks and prevent curdling.
7. Slowly pour the egg mixture back into the saucepan, stirring constantly.
8. Add the grated nutmeg and lemon juice (if using) to the soup. Stir well to combine.
9. Remove the saucepan from the heat before filling it up completely to prevent the eggs from curdling.
10. Soak slices of bread in the bottom of the soup bowls.
11. Place a fried French roll slice in the middle of each bowl.
12. Garnish the soup with poached eggs and fried bread cubes around the rim of the bowl.
13. Optionally, place a poached egg on top of the French roll in the middle of each bowl.
14. Serve the soup hot.
