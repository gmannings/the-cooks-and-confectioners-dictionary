# Poupiets

## Description
Poupiets are a classic 18th-century dish made with veal and bacon. The veal steaks are rolled up with a flavorful farce, wrapped in bacon, and roasted. They can be served as a main dish or used as a garnish for other dishes. There are also options to dress them in a ragout or fry them with truffles and gravy.

## Options and commentary
- Instead of veal, you can use chicken or turkey breast as a modern alternative.
- If you prefer a vegetarian option, you can use tofu or seitan instead of meat.
- The farce can be made with a combination of ground meat, breadcrumbs, herbs, and spices. You can customize it to your taste.
- For the ragout option, you can add vegetables like mushrooms, carrots, and onions to create a flavorful sauce.
- If you choose to fry the poupiets, you can use vegetable oil or butter for frying.

## Ingredients:
- Thin slices of bacon
- Veal steaks (or chicken/turkey breast)
- Farce ingredients (ground meat, breadcrumbs, herbs, spices)

- Salt and pepper to taste

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F).
2. Lay the thin slices of bacon on a clean surface.
3. Place the veal steaks (or chicken/turkey breast) on top of the bacon slices and gently pound them to flatten.

5. Spread a layer of the farce mixture on each veal steak.
6. Roll up the veal steaks tightly, starting from one end.
7. Secure the rolls with toothpicks or kitchen twine.
8. Place the rolled poupiets on a small spit or skewers.

10. Roast the poupiets in the preheated oven for about 30-40 minutes or until cooked through.
11. Remove the parchment paper or foil during the last 10 minutes of roasting to allow the bacon to crisp up.
