# Bilcotins

## Description
Bilcotins are a type of sweet biscuit made with egg whites, powdered sugar, marmalade, and flour. They are baked in the oven until they turn a golden brown color.

## Options and commentary
- You can use any kind of marmalade for this recipe, but orange, lemon, or apricot marmalade work particularly well.
- Feel free to get creative with the shapes of the biscuits. You can make them round, long, or in knots, or any other shape you prefer.

## Ingredients:
- 6 egg whites
- 8 tablespoons powdered sugar
- 2 tablespoons marmalade (orange, lemon, apricot, etc.)
- Fine flour (enough to make a pliable dough)

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to a gentle temperature.
2. In a mixing bowl, combine the egg whites, powdered sugar, and marmalade.
3. Gradually add the fine flour to the mixture, kneading it until it forms a very pliable dough.
4. Shape the dough into biscuits of different figures, such as round, long, or in knots.
5. Place the biscuits on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper.
6. Bake the biscuits in the preheated oven until they turn a brown rust color.
7. Remove the biscuits from the oven and immediately pull off the parchment paper while they are still hot.

## Cooking time
Approximately 15-20 minutes, depending on the size and thickness of the biscuits.
