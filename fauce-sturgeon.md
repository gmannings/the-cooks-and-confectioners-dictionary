# Fauce Sturgeon

## Description
Fauce Sturgeon is a traditional dish made with sturgeon, a type of fish. The sturgeon is first cleaned and then boiled in a mixture of water, vinegar, and salt. It is then allowed to cool and packed in the cooking liquid. This dish is typically served cold and can be enjoyed as a main course or as part of a seafood platter.

## Ingredients:
- 1 sturgeon (approximately 2 kg)
- Water
- Salt
- Vinegar

## Instructions:
1. Clean the sturgeon by removing the scales and entrails. Rinse it thoroughly under cold water.
2. Divide the sturgeon down the back into equal sides and remove the rands (fins).
3. Place the sturgeon in a large tub or container and cover it with water. Add a generous amount of salt to the water and mix well.
4. Allow the sturgeon to soak in the saltwater for about 30 minutes to remove any impurities.
5. After soaking, rinse the sturgeon again under cold water to remove the excess salt.
6. Bind the sturgeon with tape or use a flag to secure it and prevent it from falling apart during cooking.
7. In a large pot, combine water, vinegar, and salt. The ratio should be approximately 4 parts water to 1 part vinegar. Add enough of this mixture to the pot to fully submerge the sturgeon.
8. Place the pot on the stove and bring the liquid to a boil.
9. Carefully add the bound sturgeon to the boiling liquid. Reduce the heat to a simmer and cook for about 20-30 minutes. Be careful not to overcook the sturgeon, as it should still be firm and not too tender.
10. Once cooked, carefully remove the sturgeon from the pot and place it on a plate or tray to cool.
11. Once cooled, transfer the sturgeon to a container and pour the cooking liquid over it, making sure it is fully submerged.
12. Cover the container tightly and refrigerate for at least 24 hours to allow the flavors to develop.
13. Serve the fauce sturgeon cold, either as a main course or as part of a seafood platter.

## Cooking time
Approximately 20-30 minutes for boiling the sturgeon. Additional time required for cooling and refrigeration.
