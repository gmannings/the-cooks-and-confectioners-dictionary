# Fried Maids

## Description
Fried Maids is a dish made with fish, typically maids (a type of white fish). The fish is first boiled, then coated in a batter made with eggs, flour, spices, and herbs. It is then fried until golden brown and crispy. The dish is served with a sauce made from butter, vinegar, fish livers, and nutmeg. Crispy and green parsley is sprinkled over the fish for added flavor and presentation.

## Ingredients:
- 4 maids (or any white fish fillets)
- Salt
- 5 eggs
- 50 ml Canary wine (or any sweet white wine)
- 100 g flour
- Ginger
- Nutmeg
- Fresh parsley
- Clarified butter (for frying)
- Vinegar

## Instructions:
1. Fill a large pot with water and bring it to a boil.
2. Add a pinch of salt to the boiling water.
3. Carefully place the maids into the boiling water and let them cook for a few minutes until they are just cooked through.
4. Remove the maids from the boiling water and place them on a clean cloth to dry.
5. In a bowl, beat the yolks of 5 eggs and the whites of 4 eggs together.
6. Add the Canary wine, flour, a pinch of salt, ginger, and nutmeg to the beaten eggs. Mix well until you have a thick batter.
7. Finely chop a handful of fresh parsley.
8. Add the chopped parsley to the batter and mix well.
9. Heat a frying pan and add enough clarified butter to cover the bottom of the pan.
10. Dip each maid into the batter, making sure it is fully coated.
11. Carefully place the battered maids into the hot frying pan and fry them until they are golden brown and crispy on both sides.
12. Once the maids are cooked, remove them from the frying pan and place them on a serving dish.
13. In a separate bowl, mix together a knob of butter, a splash of vinegar, the livers of the fish (finely chopped), and a pinch of nutmeg. Beat the mixture until well combined.
14. Pour the butter and vinegar sauce over the fried maids.
15. In the same frying pan, fry a generous amount of parsley until it is crispy and green.
16. Sprinkle the crispy parsley over the fried maids.
