# Gingerbread

## Description
Gingerbread is a sweet and spicy cake-like treat that is flavored with ginger and other aromatic spices. It has a rich and moist texture, and is often enjoyed during the holiday season.

## Options and commentary
- You can add additional spices such as cinnamon, nutmeg, or cloves to enhance the flavor of the gingerbread.
- You can also add raisins, chopped nuts, or chocolate chips for added texture and flavor.
- If you prefer a softer gingerbread, you can reduce the amount of flour used in the recipe.
- This recipe yields a large quantity of gingerbread, so you can divide the batter into smaller portions and bake them separately if desired.

## Ingredients:
- 1 kg treacle (molasses)
- 250 g candied ginger
- 250 g citron peel
- 250 g lemon peel
- 250 g orange peel
- 50 g ground ginger
- 50 g coriander seeds
- 50 g caraway seeds
- 1 kg all-purpose flour

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 180Â°C.
2. In a large mixing bowl, combine the treacle, candied ginger, citron peel, lemon peel, and orange peel. Slice them thinly before adding to the bowl.
3. Add the ground ginger, coriander seeds, and caraway seeds to the bowl.
4. Gradually add the flour to the bowl, mixing well after each addition. The dough should come together to form a soft paste.
5. Line several baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone mats.
6. Take portions of the dough and shape them into cakes. Place the cakes onto the prepared baking sheets, leaving some space between each cake.
7. Bake the gingerbread in the preheated oven for approximately 15-20 minutes, or until the cakes are golden brown and firm to the touch.
8. Remove the gingerbread from the oven and allow it to cool completely on wire racks.
9. Once cooled, the gingerbread can be stored in an airtight container for up to a week.
