# Boiled Mussels in Claret Vinegar Sauce

## Description
This recipe is for boiled mussels served in a flavorful claret vinegar sauce. The mussels are cooked and then removed from their shells, and then simmered in a mixture of claret wine vinegar, salt, pepper, grated bread, minced thyme, minced hard-boiled egg yolks, fresh butter, large mace, and capers. The shells are rubbed with garlic and the mussels are served in the shells.

## Ingredients:
- 1 kg mussels
- 250 ml claret wine vinegar
- Salt, to taste
- Pepper, to taste
- 50 g grated bread
- 1 tsp minced thyme
- 2 hard-boiled egg yolks, minced
- 50 g fresh butter
- 1 tsp large mace
- 2 tbsp capers
- 2 cloves of garlic

## Instructions:
1. Scrub the mussels under cold running water to remove any dirt or debris.
2. In a large pot, bring water to a boil and add the mussels. Cook the mussels until they open, about 5-7 minutes.
3. Remove the mussels from the pot and let them cool slightly. Discard any mussels that did not open.
4. Once the mussels are cool enough to handle, remove the meat from the shells and set aside.
5. In a pipkin or small saucepan, combine the claret wine vinegar, salt, pepper, grated bread, minced thyme, minced hard-boiled egg yolks, fresh butter, large mace, and capers.
6. Place the saucepan over low heat and simmer the mixture for about 10 minutes, stirring occasionally.
7. While the sauce is simmering, rub the empty mussel shells with the cloves of garlic.
8. Add the cooked mussel meat to the sauce and stir to coat the mussels evenly.
9. Continue to cook the mussels in the sauce for another 5 minutes, until heated through.
10. Remove the mussels from the sauce and place them back into the cleaned mussel shells.
11. Serve the mussels in the shells, either individually or on a platter.
