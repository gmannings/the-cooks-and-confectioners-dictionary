# Eel Potage

## Description
Eel Potage is a rich and flavorful soup made with eel, fish broth, and a variety of seasonings. The eel is first fried in butter and flour to give it a crispy exterior, then stewed in a mixture of fish broth, wine, and herbs. The soup is then thickened with soaked crusts and garnished with mushrooms and capers.

## Options and commentary
- If eel is not available, you can substitute it with another firm-fleshed fish like cod or haddock.
- If you prefer a vegetarian version, you can use vegetable broth instead of fish broth.
- Feel free to adjust the seasonings according to your taste preferences.

## Ingredients:
- 500g eel fillets
- 2 tablespoons butter
- 1 tablespoon flour
- 1 liter fish broth (or vegetable broth)
- 100ml white wine
- Salt and pepper to taste
- 1 bunch of fresh herbs (such as parsley, thyme, and bay leaves)
- 4 slices of bread
- 100g mushrooms, sliced
- 2 tablespoons capers

## Instructions:
1. Clean the eel fillets by removing the skin and any bones. Cut them into bite-sized pieces.
2. In a large frying pan, melt the butter over medium heat. Add the flour and cook for 1-2 minutes until it forms a paste.
3. Add the eel fillets to the pan and fry them until they are golden brown on all sides. Remove the eel from the pan and set aside.
4. In an earthen pan or a large pot, combine the fish broth (or vegetable broth), white wine, salt, pepper, and fresh herbs. Bring the mixture to a simmer.
5. Add the fried eel fillets to the simmering broth. Cover the pan and let it stew for about 30 minutes, or until the eel is cooked through and tender.
6. While the eel is stewing, soak the bread slices in a small amount of the cooking liquid from the potage.
7. Once the eel is cooked, remove it from the potage and set aside. Remove and discard the bunch of herbs.
8. Using a blender or immersion blender, puree the soaked bread slices with a small amount of the potage liquid until smooth. This will help thicken the soup.
9. Return the pureed bread mixture to the potage and stir well to combine. Adjust the seasoning if needed.
10. To serve, place a few slices of mushrooms and a sprinkle of capers in each soup bowl. Ladle the eel potage over the mushrooms and capers.
11. Serve hot and enjoy!
