# Hotch-Pot of Pigeons

## Description
A hotch-pot is a dish made with various meats and vegetables cooked together. In this recipe, pigeons are cooked with herbs, broth, bacon, nutmeg, saffron, and vinegar. The dish is served on sippets, which are small pieces of toasted bread.

## Options and commentary
- Instead of pigeons, you can use any small game birds such as quail or Cornish hens.
- If you prefer a milder flavor, you can omit the saffron.
- You can adjust the amount of vinegar according to your taste preference.
