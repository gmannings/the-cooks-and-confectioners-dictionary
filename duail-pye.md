# Duail-pye

## Description
Duail-pye is a traditional 18th-century dish consisting of quails stuffed with a flavorful mixture of veal, bacon, herbs, and spices, and baked in a pastry crust. The quails are larded with bacon and gammon, then seasoned and stuffed with a farce made from veal, bacon, marrow, parsley, herbs, mushrooms, and truffles. The pie is then baked until golden and served with a rich veal sweetbread and mushroom sauce.

## Options and commentary
- Instead of quails, you can use small game birds like Cornish hens or poussins.
- If you can't find gammon, you can use regular bacon.
- Feel free to adjust the herbs and spices to your taste.
- The pastry can be made from scratch or you can use store-bought puff pastry for convenience.

## Ingredients:
- 4 quails
- 8 slices of bacon or gammon
- 200g tender veal, minced
- 100g raw bacon, minced
- 50g marrow, diced
- 2 tablespoons parsley, finely chopped
- 2 tablespoons mixed fresh herbs (such as thyme, rosemary, and sage), finely chopped
- 50g veal suet, minced
- 50g mushrooms, finely chopped
- 50g truffles, finely chopped
- 1 egg, beaten
- Salt and pepper, to taste
- 500g puff pastry
- 50g lard, pounded
- 1 bay leaf

For the Cullis:
- 2 veal sweetbreads, blanched and diced
- 100g mushrooms, sliced
- 50g truffles, sliced
- 500ml veal or chicken stock
- Juice of 1 lemon

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F).
2. Truss the quails by tying their legs together with kitchen twine.
3. Place the quails on a cutting board and gently beat them on the breast side with a rolling pin to break their bones slightly. This will help them cook more evenly.
4. Lard the quails by inserting thick strips of bacon or gammon into the breast meat.
5. Season the quails with salt and pepper, then make a lengthwise slit down the back of each quail.
6. Set aside the quail livers for later use.
7. In a bowl, combine the minced veal, minced raw bacon, diced marrow, parsley, mixed herbs, veal suet, mushrooms, and truffles. Mix well.
8. Bind the farce mixture with the beaten egg.
9. Stuff each quail with the farce mixture, filling the cavity through the slit in the back.
10. Mince the reserved quail livers and pound them with the minced bacon. Season with spices of your choice.
11. In a separate bowl, prepare the pastry by mixing the egg, fresh butter, and a little salt. Roll out two pieces of pastry.
12. Place one piece of pastry on a buttered paper-lined baking sheet.
13. Spread a layer of pounded lard over the pastry.
14. Arrange the stuffed quails on the pastry, along with the mushrooms, truffles, and a bay leaf.
15. Cover the quails with thin slices of bacon.
16. Place the second piece of pastry on top as the lid.
17. Seal the edges of the pastry together to enclose the quails completely.
18. Brush the entire pie with beaten egg wash.
19. Bake the pie in the preheated oven for approximately 1 hour, or until the pastry is golden brown and the quails are cooked through.
20. While the pie is baking, prepare the cullis. In a saucepan, combine the diced veal sweetbreads, sliced mushrooms, sliced truffles, and veal or chicken stock. Simmer for about 20 minutes until the sweetbreads are cooked and the sauce has reduced slightly.
21. When the pie is done, remove it from the oven and cut off the lid.
22. Remove all the strips of bacon from the quails and discard any excess fat.
23. Squeeze in the juice of a lemon and pour in the prepared cullis.
24. Place the lid back on the pie and serve it hot as a side dish.

## Cooking time
Approximately 1 hour for baking the pie.
