# Pickled Artichokes

## Description
This recipe is for pickling artichokes, which can be preserved for up to a year. The artichokes are first boiled in salted water, then blanched to remove the chokes. They are then washed and placed in a pickling liquid with the option to add vinegar. Finally, oil or butter is poured on top to seal the jar. Before using the pickled artichokes, they should be soaked in fresh water to remove the salt.

## Ingredients:
- Artichokes
- Water
- Salt
- Vinegar (optional)
- Oil or butter

## Instructions:
1. Fill a pot with enough water to cover the artichokes.
2. Add a proportionate amount of salt to the water.
3. Place the pot on the stove and bring the water to a boil.
4. Once the water is boiling, add the artichokes to the pot.
5. Boil the artichokes until they are tender. The cooking time will vary depending on the size of the artichokes, but it is usually around 20-30 minutes.
6. Remove the pot from the heat and let it sit until the salt settles to the bottom.
7. Carefully pour the liquid into a container that will be used to store the pickled artichokes.
8. In a separate pot, bring water to a boil.
9. Add the blanched artichokes to the boiling water and cook until the chokes can be easily removed. This usually takes about 10 minutes.
10. Remove the artichokes from the boiling water and transfer them to a bowl of cold water to stop the cooking process.
11. Repeat steps 9 and 10 two or three more times, using fresh boiling water each time, until the artichokes are clean.
12. If desired, add a small amount of vinegar to the pickling liquid.
13. Place the cleaned artichokes in the pickling liquid, making sure they are fully submerged.
14. Pour oil or melted butter on top of the pickling liquid to create a seal and prevent air from entering.
15. Close the container tightly and store in a cool, dark place.
16. The pickled artichokes can be stored for up to a year.
17. Before using the pickled artichokes, soak them in fresh water for a few minutes to remove the excess salt.
