# Sweet Bread Pasties

## Description
Sweet Bread Pasties are small pastry pockets filled with a mixture of finely chopped sweetbreads, veal fat, eggs, bread crumbs, rosewater, cream, nutmeg, and sugar. They can be either baked or fried until golden brown.

## Options and commentary
- Sweetbreads: Sweetbreads are the thymus or pancreas glands of young animals, usually veal or lamb. If you cannot find sweetbreads, you can substitute them with chicken or turkey breast.
- Marrow or Veal Fat: If you cannot find marrow or veal fat, you can substitute it with butter or another type of animal fat.
- Rosewater: Rosewater adds a delicate floral flavor to the pasties. If you don't have rosewater, you can substitute it with vanilla extract.
- Puff Pastry: You can use store-bought puff pastry or make your own from scratch.

## Ingredients:
- 500g sweetbreads (or chicken/turkey breast)
- 100g marrow or veal fat (or butter)
- 2 egg yolks
- 50g bread crumbs
- 2 tbsp rosewater (or vanilla extract)
- 100ml cream
- 1/2 tsp nutmeg
- 2 tbsp sugar
- 1 sheet of puff pastry
- Cold water
- Sugar for sprinkling

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 180째C (350째F) if you plan to bake the pasties. If you prefer to fry them, skip this step for now.
2. In a pot of boiling water, blanch the sweetbreads for 5 minutes to remove any impurities. Drain and let them cool.
3. Once the sweetbreads are cool enough to handle, remove any membranes or tough parts. Finely chop the sweetbreads and set aside.
4. In a mixing bowl, combine the chopped sweetbreads, marrow or veal fat, egg yolks, bread crumbs, rosewater, cream, nutmeg, and sugar. Mix well until all the ingredients are evenly incorporated.
5. Roll out the puff pastry on a lightly floured surface to a thickness of about 3mm.
6. Cut the rolled-out pastry into small circles or squares, about the size of your palm.
7. Place a spoonful of the sweetbread mixture onto one half of each pastry circle or square, leaving a small border around the edges.
8. Fold the other half of the pastry over the filling and press the edges together to seal. You can use a fork to crimp the edges for a decorative touch.
9. If you plan to bake the pasties, place them on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Brush the tops with a little cold water and sprinkle with sugar.
10. Bake in the preheated oven for 20-25 minutes, or until the pasties are golden brown and puffed up.
11. If you prefer to fry the pasties, heat oil in a deep pan or fryer to 180째C (350째F). Carefully place the pasties into the hot oil and fry until golden brown on both sides. Remove from the oil and drain on paper towels.
12. Serve the sweet bread pasties warm as an appetizer or snack.
