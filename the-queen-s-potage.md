# The Queen's Potage

## Description
The Queen's Potage is a creamy and flavorful soup made with almonds, bread, lemon, herbs, and meat broth. It is a rich and luxurious dish that was popular in the 18th century.

## Options and commentary
- You can use either a capon or a partridge for the minced meat in this recipe.
- If you prefer a vegetarian version, you can omit the meat and use vegetable broth instead.
- Pomegranates, pistachios, and cockscombs are traditional garnishes for this dish, but you can use any other garnishes of your choice.

## Ingredients:
- 100g almonds, blanched and peeled
- 500ml meat broth (chicken or beef)
- 50g bread, crust removed
- 1 lemon, zest and juice
- 1 bunch of fresh herbs (such as parsley, thyme, and rosemary)
- 100g minced meat (capon or partridge)
- 100g mushrooms, sliced
- Salt and pepper, to taste
- Pomegranate seeds, pistachios, and cockscombs (optional, for garnish)

## Instructions:
1. In a saucepan, bring the meat broth to a simmer.
2. In a blender or food processor, blend the almonds until finely ground.
3. Add the ground almonds, bread crumbs, lemon zest, and fresh herbs to the simmering broth. Stir well.
4. Continue to simmer the mixture for about 15 minutes, stirring occasionally.
5. Remove the saucepan from heat and let the mixture cool slightly.
6. Strain the mixture through a fine-mesh sieve or cheesecloth, pressing on the solids to extract as much liquid as possible. Discard the solids.
7. Return the strained broth to the saucepan and place it back on the heat.
8. Add the minced meat and sliced mushrooms to the broth. Cook for another 10 minutes, or until the meat is cooked through.
9. Season the potage with salt, pepper, and lemon juice to taste.
10. In a separate bowl, soak the bread slices in a small amount of the strained almond broth.
11. Arrange the soaked bread slices in a serving dish.
12. Pour the remaining almond broth over the soaked bread, ensuring it is fully saturated.
13. Hold a red-hot iron over the dish for a few seconds to lightly toast the top of the potage.
14. Garnish the dish with pomegranate seeds, pistachios, and cockscombs, if desired.
