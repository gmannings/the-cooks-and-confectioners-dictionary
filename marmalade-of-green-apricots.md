# Marmalade of Green Apricots

## Description
This recipe is for making a sweet and tangy marmalade using green apricots. The apricots are boiled in a lye made from water and ashes, which helps to remove impurities. The apricots are then cooked, mashed, and sweetened with sugar to create a thick and flavorful marmalade.

## Options and commentary
- Instead of using lye made from water and ashes, you can use a small amount of baking soda to help remove impurities from the apricots.
- You can adjust the amount of sugar according to your taste preference.
- This marmalade can be stored in jars or glasses, or it can be dried for a longer shelf life.

## Ingredients:
- 1 kg green apricots
- 1 liter water
- 1 teaspoon baking soda
- 1 kg sugar

## Instructions:
1. In a large pot, combine the water and baking soda. Bring to a boil and let it simmer for a few minutes to create a lye solution.
2. Remove the pot from the heat and let the lye solution cool for a while.
3. Once the lye solution has cooled, carefully pour off the clear liquid, leaving behind any sediment or impurities.
4. Return the pot to the heat and bring the lye solution to a boil again.
5. Add three or four apricots to the boiling lye solution to test if it is strong enough to cleanse them. If the apricots become clean and the lye solution doesn't boil, add the rest of the apricots.
6. Stir the apricots gently in the lye solution, making sure not to let them boil. Cook until the apricots are tender.
7. Using a slotted spoon, transfer the cooked apricots to a cloth and wash them in fresh water. 
8. Change the water and continue boiling the apricots until they are very soft.
9. Drain the apricots and pass them through a sieve into a pan to create a paste.
10. Place the pan with the apricot paste over low heat and dry it, stirring constantly with a spatula, until most of the moisture has evaporated and the paste starts to stick to the pan.
11. Measure the weight of the dried apricot paste and add an equal amount of sugar that has been boiled to its crackled quality. 
12. Let the marmalade simmer for a while to allow the sugar to dissolve and the flavors to meld together.
13. Transfer the marmalade into pots or glasses, or spread it out thinly to dry.
