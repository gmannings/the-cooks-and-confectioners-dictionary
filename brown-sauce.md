# Brown Sauce

## Description
Brown sauce is a rich and savory sauce made with a combination of herbs, capers, anchovies, and fish broth. It is thickened with a cullis, which is a type of sauce made from a meat or vegetable stock. Brown sauce adds depth of flavor to a variety of dishes and can be used as a base for stews, gravies, and meat dishes.

## Ingredients:
- 2 tablespoons butter
- 2 tablespoons chopped chives
- 2 tablespoons chopped parsley
- 2 tablespoons capers
- 2 anchovy fillets
- 1 cup fish broth
- 1 cup cullis (meat or vegetable stock)

## Instructions:
1. In a saucepan, melt the butter over medium heat.
2. Add the chopped chives, parsley, capers, and anchovy fillets to the saucepan. Cook for 2-3 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the herbs and anchovies are fragrant.
3. Pour in the fish broth and bring to a simmer. Cook for another 5 minutes to allow the flavors to meld together.
4. Gradually whisk in the cullis, a little at a time, until the sauce reaches your desired thickness. Be careful not to add too much cullis at once, as it may make the sauce too thick.
5. Continue to cook the sauce for another 5 minutes, stirring occasionally, to ensure it is heated through.
6. Taste the sauce and adjust the seasoning if needed. You can add salt and pepper to taste, if desired.
7. Remove the sauce from the heat and serve immediately.
