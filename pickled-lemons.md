# Pickled Lemons

## Description
Pickled lemons are a tangy and flavorful condiment that can be used in a variety of dishes. They add a bright and citrusy flavor to salads, marinades, and even cocktails. This recipe provides a simple method for pickling lemons using water, salt, and white wine vinegar.

## Ingredients:
- 4 lemons
- 2 cups water
- 1/4 cup salt
- 2 cups white wine vinegar

## Instructions:
1. Wash the lemons thoroughly to remove any dirt or wax. Cut each lemon into quarters, but make sure not to cut all the way through. Leave the quarters attached at the stem end.
2. In a large pot, bring the water and salt to a boil. Add the lemons to the boiling water and simmer for 5 minutes. This will help soften the lemons and remove any bitterness.
3. Remove the lemons from the pot and let them cool slightly. Gently press each lemon to open up the quarters and expose the flesh.
4. Place the lemons in a clean glass jar or container. Pour the white wine vinegar over the lemons, making sure they are completely submerged. If needed, add more vinegar to cover the lemons.
5. Seal the jar tightly and let the lemons pickle in the refrigerator for at least 1 week before using. The longer they pickle, the more flavorful they will become.
