# Syrup of Mint

## Description
Syrup of Mint is a sweet and refreshing syrup that can be used in a variety of beverages and desserts. It has a strong mint flavor with a hint of pomegranate and rose.

## Ingredients:
- 1 quart (946 ml) of quince syrup (before they are fully ripe)
- 2 quarts (1.9 liters) of mint juice
- 1 pint (473 ml) of pomegranate juice
- 1 ounce (28 grams) of red roses
- Double-refined sugar

## Instructions:
1. In a large container, combine the quince syrup, mint juice, pomegranate juice, and red roses.
2. Steep the mixture for twenty-four hours to allow the flavors to infuse.
3. After twenty-four hours, strain out the solid ingredients using a fine-mesh strainer or cheesecloth.
4. Transfer the strained liquid to a saucepan and bring it to a boil.
5. Reduce the heat and simmer the mixture until it is reduced by half, stirring occasionally to prevent burning.
6. Once the mixture has reduced, remove it from the heat and strain out any remaining solids.
7. Return the liquid to the saucepan and add double-refined sugar to taste. Stir until the sugar is completely dissolved.
8. Bring the mixture back to a simmer and cook for a few more minutes to thicken the syrup.
9. Remove from heat and let the syrup cool completely.
10. Once cooled, transfer the syrup to a sterilized bottle or jar for storage.

## Cooking time
Approximately 1-2 hours (including steeping time)
