# Thornback Soup

## Description
Thornback Soup is a rich and flavorful fish soup made with thornback ray, herbs, and spices. The soup is thickened with a bread-based cullis and served with a garnish of lemon and a French roll.

## Ingredients:
- Butter
- 1 French roll
- 2 onions, sliced
- 12 whole peppercorns
- 6 cloves
- A handful of parsley
- A sprig of thyme
- 1 thornback ray (skinned)
- Fresh fish of your choice
- Salt
- Pepper
- Lemon

## Instructions:
1. In a saucepan, melt a good quantity of butter over medium heat.
2. Add the crumb of a French roll, sliced onions, whole peppercorns, cloves, parsley, and thyme to the saucepan.
3. Fry the ingredients for about 15 minutes or until the bread is crispy, taking care not to burn the herbs.
4. Prepare a stock of cullis by straining the mixture to the thickness of a cream.
5. Cut half a pound of the best part of the thornback ray into pieces and add it to the cullis in the saucepan, along with some other fresh fish.
6. Strain the cullis to remove any bones or skin.
7. Mince the lean part of the fish that was cut from the bones and cook it in a small saucepan with a bit of butter, salt, and pepper until the rawness is taken off.
8. Remove the cooked fish from the saucepan, mince it again, and add it back to the saucepan.
9. Squeeze in some lemon juice and mix well.
10. Place a French roll in the middle of the soup.
11. Heat the cullis and soak the bread in it.
12. Squeeze in some lemon juice to taste.
13. Garnish the soup with a rim on the outside.
