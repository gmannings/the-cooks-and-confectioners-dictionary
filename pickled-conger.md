# Pickled Conger

## Description
Pickled Conger is a traditional dish made by boiling and pickling pieces of conger eel. The eel is first cleaned and cut into pieces, then boiled in a mixture of water, vinegar, salt, and fennel. After boiling, the eel is placed in a pan with a mixture of vinegar and beer, and garnished with fresh fennel.

## Ingredients:
- 1 conger eel
- Water
- Vinegar
- Salt
- Handful of fennel
- Beer

## Instructions:
1. Clean the conger eel by removing the skin and internal organs. Cut the eel into pieces.
2. Bind the eel pieces together with tape to keep them intact during cooking.
3. In a large pot, bring water, vinegar, salt, and a handful of fennel to a boil.
4. Add the bound conger eel pieces to the boiling liquid and cook for about 10-15 minutes, or until the eel is cooked through and tender.
5. Remove the cooked eel from the pot and place it in a pan.
6. In a separate bowl, mix together vinegar and beer.
7. Pour the vinegar and beer mixture over the cooked eel in the pan.
8. Garnish the top of the fish with a handful of fresh fennel.
9. Allow the pickled conger to cool and marinate in the pan for a few hours or overnight before serving.

## Cooking time
Approximately 10-15 minutes for boiling the eel, plus additional time for marinating.
