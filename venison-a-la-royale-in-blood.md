# Venison a la Royale in Blood

## Description
Venison a la Royale in Blood is a classic 18th-century dish made with roasted venison, stewed in its own blood, and served with a ragout of cucumbers, sweetbreads, and asparagus. It is a rich and flavorful dish that showcases the flavors of game meat.

## Options and commentary
- If you cannot find venison, you can substitute it with beef or lamb.
- The use of blood in this recipe may not be appealing to everyone. If you prefer, you can omit the blood and use a rich beef or game stock instead.
- The ragout can be customized with other vegetables of your choice, such as mushrooms or peas.

## Ingredients:
- 1 venison loin (or substitute with beef or lamb)
- Salt and pepper, to taste
- 2 tablespoons vegetable oil
- 2 cucumbers, peeled and diced
- 2 sweetbreads, blanched and diced
- 8 asparagus spears, trimmed and cut into 2-inch pieces
- 1 cup venison (or beef or game) blood (or substitute with rich stock)
- Petits (small garnish vegetables)
- Crispy parsley, for garnish

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F).
2. Season the venison loin with salt and pepper.
3. Heat the vegetable oil in a large oven-safe skillet over medium-high heat.
4. Sear the venison loin on all sides until browned, about 2 minutes per side.
5. Transfer the skillet to the preheated oven and roast the venison loin for about 15 minutes for medium-rare doneness. Adjust the cooking time according to your preference.
6. Remove the venison loin from the skillet and let it rest for 10 minutes before slicing.
7. In the same skillet, add the diced cucumbers, sweetbreads, and asparagus. Cook over medium heat until the vegetables are tender, about 5 minutes.
8. Pour in the venison blood (or stock) and bring it to a simmer. Cook for an additional 5 minutes to thicken the sauce.
9. Slice the rested venison loin into thick slices and return them to the skillet with the ragout. Cook for another 2 minutes to heat through.
10. Garnish the dish with petits and crispy parsley.
11. Serve the Venison a la Royale in Blood hot.
