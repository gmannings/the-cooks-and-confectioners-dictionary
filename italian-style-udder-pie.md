# Italian Style Udder Pie

## Description
This recipe is for a savory udder pie, prepared in the Italian style. The udder is boiled until tender, then diced and seasoned with a blend of spices. The pie crust is made with custard pastry and baked until golden. The udder is combined with marrow, dates, pistachios (or pine nuts), and a custard mixture made with cream, eggs, salt, sugar, rose water, and musk. The pie is then baked and garnished with slices of dates, candied pistachios, and a sprinkle of sugar.

## Ingredients:
- 1 udder
- Salt
- Pepper
- Nutmegs
- Cloves
- Mace
- Cinnamon
- Pie crust (custard pastry)
- Marrow
- Dates
- Pistachios or pine nuts
- Cream
- Eggs
- Sugar
- Rose water
- Musk (optional)
- Slices of dates (for garnish)
- Candied pistachios (for garnish)
- Sugar (for garnish)

## Instructions:
1. Boil the udder until tender. Let it cool, then cut it into small dice.
2. Season the diced udder with salt, pepper, nutmegs, cloves, mace, and cinnamon. Mix well to ensure the spices are evenly distributed.
3. Preheat the oven to the recommended temperature for baking the pie crust.
4. Roll out the pie crust to about an inch in height, similar to a custard tart.
5. Prick the pie crust with a fork to prevent it from puffing up during baking.
6. Place the pie crust in the oven and bake until it is dry and golden.
7. In a bowl, combine the diced udder with bits of marrow, dates, and pistachios (or pine nuts).
8. In a separate bowl, prepare the custard mixture by whisking together cream, eggs, salt, sugar, rose water, and musk (if using). Use only three egg whites and discard the rest.
9. Pour the custard mixture over the udder mixture and mix well to combine.
10. Pour the udder and custard mixture into the pre-baked pie crust.
11. Place the pie back in the oven and bake until the custard is set and the pie is golden brown.
12. Once the pie is baked, remove it from the oven and let it cool slightly.
13. Garnish the pie with slices of dates and candied pistachios.
14. Sprinkle some sugar over the top of the pie for added sweetness and decoration.
