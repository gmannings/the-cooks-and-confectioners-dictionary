# Clarified Sugar

## Description
This recipe provides instructions for clarifying sugar, which was a common practice in the 18th century to remove impurities and achieve a clear, refined sugar. Clarified sugar was often used in delicate desserts and confections.

## Ingredients:
- Sugar
- Water
- Eggs

## Instructions:
1. In an earthen pan, add a little water. The size of the pan should be proportionate to the quantity of sugar you want to clarify.
2. Break an egg (or more, depending on the quantity of sugar) into the pan, including the shell.
3. Whisk the egg vigorously with a whisk or birchen rods until well beaten.
4. Pour the beaten egg mixture onto the sugar that is to be clarified.
5. Place the pan over the fire and keep stirring the mixture continuously.
6. When the mixture starts to boil, skim off any foam that forms on the surface.
7. As the sugar runs from time to time, add a little cold water to prevent it from overflowing and to help the foam rise better.
8. Additionally, add the froth of the white of an egg that has been separately whipped.
9. Continue stirring and skimming the sugar until the foam turns from black and foul to a small whitish froth.
10. Test the clarity of the sugar by placing a small amount on a skimmer or spatula. It should appear very clear.
11. Once the sugar is thoroughly skimmed and clear, remove it from the fire.
12. Strain the clarified sugar through a straining bag to remove any remaining impurities.
13. Your sugar is now completely clarified and ready to use.
