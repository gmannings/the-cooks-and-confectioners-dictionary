# Fried Cod's Tail

## Description
This recipe is for frying a cod's tail. The cod tail is scalded in hot water, then coated in flour and fried in clarified butter. It is served with white pepper and orange juice, and garnished with pieces of cod's back that have been fried in pastry.

## Options and commentary
- You can use fresh or frozen cod tail for this recipe.
- If you don't have refined butter, you can use regular butter or vegetable oil for frying.
- The garnish of fried cod's back in pastry is optional, but it adds a nice touch to the dish.

## Ingredients:
- 1 cod tail
- Hot water
- Flour
- Refined butter (or regular butter or vegetable oil)
- White pepper
- Orange juice
- Pieces of cod's back (optional)
- Pastry dough (optional)

## Instructions:
1. Fill a pot with hot water and bring it to a scalding temperature. Do not let it boil.
2. Place the cod tail in the hot water and let it sit for a few minutes to scald. This will help remove any excess moisture from the fish.
3. Remove the cod tail from the hot water and drain it well.
4. Coat the cod tail in flour, making sure it is evenly coated on all sides.
5. Heat the refined butter (or regular butter or vegetable oil) in a frying pan over medium heat.
6. Carefully place the coated cod tail in the hot butter and fry it until it is golden brown and crispy on both sides. This will take about 3-4 minutes per side, depending on the thickness of the cod tail.
7. Once the cod tail is cooked, remove it from the pan and place it on a serving plate.
8. Sprinkle the fried cod tail with white pepper and drizzle it with orange juice.
9. If using the garnish of fried cod's back in pastry, prepare the pastry dough according to your favorite recipe or use store-bought pastry dough.
10. Cut pieces of cod's back and wrap them in small pieces of pastry dough.
11. Heat some refined butter (or regular butter or vegetable oil) in a separate frying pan over medium heat.
12. Carefully place the wrapped pieces of cod's back in the hot butter and fry them until the pastry is golden brown and crispy.
13. Remove the fried cod's back from the pan and place them around the fried cod tail on the serving plate.
14. Serve the fried cod's tail immediately.
