## Description
Gooseberry Tanley is a sweet and tangy dessert made with green gooseberries, eggs, cream, and sugar. The gooseberries are cooked in butter until tender, then combined with a mixture of beaten eggs and cream. The dish is fried until set, then garnished with rose water and sugar.

## Ingredients:

## Instructions:
1. Rinse the gooseberries and remove any stems or leaves. 
2. In a frying pan, melt the butter over medium heat.
