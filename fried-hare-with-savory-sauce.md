# Fried Hare with Savory Sauce

## Description
This recipe is for a traditional fried hare dish, served with a savory sauce. The hare is first quartered and fried in hog's lard, giving it a crispy exterior. The sauce is made by toasting bread, soaking it in beef broth and white wine, and adding ginger, cloves, and verjuice. The dish is then garnished with greens and slices of lemon.

## Ingredients:
- 1 hare, quartered
- Hog's lard, for frying
- 2 slices of bread
- 1 cup beef broth
- 1 cup white wine
- 1 teaspoon ginger, beaten
- 1/2 teaspoon cloves, beaten
- 1 tablespoon verjuice
- Butter, for serving
- Sugar, for serving
- Mustard, for serving
- Juice of 1 lemon
- Greens, for garnish
- Slices of lemon, for garnish

## Instructions:
1. Preheat a large frying pan or skillet over medium heat.
2. Add enough hog's lard to the pan to cover the bottom.
3. Once the lard is hot, carefully place the quartered hare in the pan.
4. Fry the hare on each side until it is cooked through and has a crispy exterior. This will take approximately 10-15 minutes per side, depending on the size of the hare.
5. While the hare is frying, prepare the sauce. Toast the slices of bread until they are golden brown.
6. In a separate saucepan, heat the beef broth and white wine over medium heat.
7. Place the toasted bread in the saucepan with the beef broth and white wine mixture. Allow the bread to soak for a few minutes until it becomes soft.
8. Remove the bread from the saucepan and place it in a blender or food processor.
9. Add the beaten ginger and cloves to the blender or food processor.
10. Blend the mixture until it becomes smooth.
11. Strain the sauce through a fine mesh sieve to remove any lumps.
12. Return the sauce to the saucepan and add the verjuice. Stir well to combine.
13. Heat the sauce over low heat until it is warmed through.
14. In a small bowl, combine butter, sugar, mustard, and the juice of 1 lemon to create a condiment for serving.
15. Once the hare is cooked, remove it from the frying pan and place it on a serving dish.
16. Pour the warm sauce over the hare, ensuring that it is evenly coated.
17. Garnish the dish with greens and slices of lemon.
18. Serve the fried hare with the savory sauce and the condiment on the side.

## Cooking time
Approximately 30-40 minutes, depending on the size of the hare.
