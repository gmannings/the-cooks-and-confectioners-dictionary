# Boiled Salmon with Anchovy Sauce

## Description
This recipe is for boiling a whole salmon fillet, known as a "jole," in a flavorful broth and serving it with a rich anchovy sauce. The salmon is cooked in a mixture of vinegar, water, herbs, spices, and lemon peel, which infuses it with delicious flavors. The anchovy sauce adds a savory and tangy element to the dish. This is a classic and elegant way to prepare salmon.

## Ingredients:
- 1 whole salmon fillet (approximately 1 kg)
- 1 liter water
- 250 ml white vinegar
- 1 tablespoon salt
- 1 bouquet garni (a bundle of fresh herbs such as parsley, thyme, and bay leaves)
- 1 onion, studded with 4 cloves
- 1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg
- 1/2 teaspoon ground pepper
- 1/2 teaspoon whole mace
- 1 piece of lemon peel

For the sauce:
- 2 anchovies
- 500 ml strong broth (such as fish or vegetable broth)
- 1 piece of lemon peel
- 225 g butter
- 125 ml red wine (such as Claret)

For garnish:
- Lemon peel strips

## Instructions:
1. In a large stew-pan or kettle, combine the water, vinegar, salt, bouquet garni, onion studded with cloves, nutmeg, pepper, mace, and lemon peel. Place the pan on the stove and bring the mixture to a boil.
2. Once the mixture is boiling, carefully add the salmon fillet to the pan. Make sure the salmon is fully submerged in the liquid. Allow the liquid to return to a boil.
3. Reduce the heat to a simmer and cook the salmon for approximately 15 minutes, or until it is cooked through and flakes easily with a fork. The cooking time may vary depending on the thickness of the fillet.
4. While the salmon is cooking, prepare the anchovy sauce. In a separate saucepan, combine the anchovies, strong broth, and lemon peel. Bring the mixture to a boil and then reduce the heat to a simmer. Cook for a few minutes to allow the flavors to meld together.
5. Remove the anchovies and lemon peel from the saucepan and strain the sauce through a sieve to remove any solids.
6. Return the strained sauce to the saucepan and add the butter and red wine. Place the saucepan over low heat and stir until the butter has melted and the sauce has thickened slightly.
7. Once the salmon is cooked, carefully remove it from the broth and transfer it to a serving dish.
8. Pour the anchovy sauce over the salmon, ensuring it is evenly coated.
9. Garnish the dish with strips of lemon peel.
10. Serve the boiled salmon with anchovy sauce immediately.
