# Apricots in Syrup

## Description
This recipe is for preserving apricots in a sweet syrup. The apricots are cooked in a syrup made from sugar and water until they are tender and translucent. They are then drained and dried, resulting in a delicious and long-lasting treat.

## Options and commentary
- You can adjust the amount of sugar used in the syrup to suit your taste. 
- If you don't have access to fresh apricots, you can use canned apricots instead. Just make sure to drain them well before adding them to the syrup.

## Ingredients:
- Fresh apricots
- Sugar
- Water

## Instructions:
1. Wash and stone the apricots. Remove the pits from the center of each apricot.
2. Weigh the apricots and measure out an equal amount of sugar.
3. In a large saucepan, combine the sugar and enough water to cover the apricots. Bring the mixture to a boil over medium heat, stirring until the sugar has dissolved.
4. Continue to boil the syrup until it reaches a high temperature. To test if the syrup is ready, drop a small amount onto a plate. If it forms a drop that slides off when it is cold, the syrup is done.
5. Add the apricots to the syrup and stir gently to coat them evenly. 
6. Once the syrup is thoroughly heated, give the apricots a stir and turn them over to ensure they are evenly cooked. 
7. Tie each apricot individually in a piece of cheesecloth or muslin to keep them separate during cooking. 
8. Return the apricots to the syrup and continue to boil them as quickly as possible. Skim off any impurities that rise to the surface of the syrup.
9. When the apricots look clear and tender, remove them from the syrup and place them on a sieve to drain off any excess liquid.
10. Carefully remove the apricots from the cheesecloth or muslin and place them on a tray or rack to dry. You can either dry them in the sun or in a low-temperature oven.
11. Allow the apricots to dry completely before storing them in an airtight container.

## Cooking time
- Cooking time will vary depending on the size and ripeness of the apricots, but it is estimated to take around 30-45 minutes to cook the apricots in the syrup and another 1-2 hours to dry them.
