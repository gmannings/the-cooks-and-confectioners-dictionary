# Chrystal Jelly

## Description
Chrystal Jelly is a clear, gelatinous dessert made from calves' feet, white wine, lemon juice, and sugar. It has a delicate flavor and a smooth, jiggly texture.

## Options and commentary
- You can adjust the amount of sugar and lemon juice to suit your taste preferences.
- If you don't have access to calves' feet, you can use gelatin sheets or powder as a substitute.
- Ambergreefe and musk are traditional ingredients that add a subtle fragrance to the jelly. However, they are not commonly used in modern cooking and can be omitted if desired.

## Ingredients:
- 4 pairs of calves' feet
- 8 quarts (7.6 liters) of spring water
- 5 pints (2.4 liters) of old clear white wine
- Juice of 4 lemons
- 4 blades of mace
- 3 slices of ginger
- 5 pounds (2.3 kilograms) of white sugar
- Whites of 16 eggs
- A grain of ambergreefe (optional)
- A grain of musk (optional)
- 1/2 pint (240 milliliters) of rose water
- Isinglass (optional)

## Instructions:
1. Remove the bones and fat from the calves' feet. Rinse them under cold water to remove any impurities.
2. Place the calves' feet in a large bowl and cover them with fresh water. Let them soak for 24 hours, changing the water three to four times during this period.
3. Transfer the soaked calves' feet to a clean pot or pipkin. Add 8 quarts of spring water to the pot and bring it to a boil.
4. Skim off any impurities that rise to the surface of the water. Continue boiling the mixture until it has reduced by half.
5. Strain the liquid through a fine-mesh sieve or cheesecloth to remove any solids. Allow the liquid to cool.
6. Once the liquid has cooled, remove any fat that has risen to the top and scrape off any settling from the bottom.
7. Transfer the liquid to a gallon and a half (5.7 liters) capacity pipkin or pot.
8. Add 5 pints of old clear white wine, the juice of 4 lemons, 4 blades of mace, and 3 slices of ginger to the pot.
9. Place the pot on the fire and heat the mixture until everything is dissolved. Remove from heat and allow it to cool.
10. In a separate dish, beat together 5 pounds of white sugar and the whites of 16 eggs until well combined.
11. Transfer the sugar and egg mixture to the pot with the jelly. Stir everything together.
12. Tie a grain of ambergreefe and musk in a linen rag and add it to the pot. This step is optional.
13. Pour in 1/2 pint of rose water and stir everything together.
14. Place the pot over a gentle charcoal fire and let it stew. Before it boils, add a little isinglass if desired.
15. Once the mixture boils, let it cool slightly and then strain it into desired molds or containers.
16. Allow the jelly to set in the refrigerator for several hours or overnight.
17. Serve the Chrystal Jelly chilled.

## Cooking time
Approximately 24 hours soaking time for the calves' feet, plus additional time for boiling, cooling, and setting the jelly.
