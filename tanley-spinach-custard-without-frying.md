# Tanley (Spinach Custard) without Frying

## Description
This recipe is a modernized version of an 18th-century dish called Tanley. It is a savory spinach custard that is cooked without frying. The custard is made with cream, spinach juice, tansy juice, eggs, salt, nutmeg, and sugar. It is then baked in the oven and served with a lemon sauce.

## Options and commentary
- You can use fresh or frozen spinach for this recipe. If using frozen spinach, make sure to thaw and drain it before extracting the juice.
- Tansy juice may be difficult to find, so you can substitute it with a combination of fresh parsley juice and a small amount of dried tansy herb for a similar flavor.
- Adjust the amount of sugar and lemon juice according to your taste preference.
- This dish can be served as a side dish or a light main course.

## Ingredients:
- 500 ml cream
- 125 ml spinach juice (extracted from fresh or frozen spinach)
- 60 ml tansy juice (or 45 ml fresh parsley juice + 1/2 teaspoon dried tansy herb)
- 10 egg yolks
- 5 egg whites
- Salt, to taste
- Grated nutmeg, to taste
- Sugar, to taste
- Juice of 1 lemon
- Butter, for greasing the dish
- Fine sugar, for serving

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 180Â°C.
2. Butter a skillet or baking dish.
3. In a saucepan, heat the cream over medium heat until it starts to simmer.
4. Add the spinach juice, tansy juice (or parsley juice + dried tansy herb), and stir well.
5. In a separate bowl, whisk together the egg yolks and egg whites until well combined.
6. Slowly pour the hot cream mixture into the eggs, whisking constantly to prevent curdling.
7. Season the mixture with salt, grated nutmeg, and sugar to your taste preference. Stir well.
8. Pour the custard mixture into the buttered skillet or baking dish.
9. Place the skillet or baking dish in a larger baking pan filled with hot water to create a water bath.
10. Carefully transfer the baking pan to the preheated oven.
11. Bake for about 30-40 minutes or until the custard is set and slightly firm to the touch.
12. Remove the skillet or baking dish from the water bath and let it cool for a few minutes.
13. In the meantime, prepare the lemon sauce by combining the juice of 1 lemon, a knob of butter, and a sprinkle of fine sugar in a small saucepan. Heat gently until the butter melts and the sugar dissolves.
14. Once the custard has cooled slightly, drizzle the lemon sauce over the top.
15. Serve the Tanley warm as a side dish or a light main course.
