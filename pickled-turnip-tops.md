# Pickled Turnip Tops

## Description
This recipe is for pickling turnip tops, which were a popular vegetable in the 18th century. The turnip tops are boiled until tender and then pickled in a mixture of white wine vinegar and salt. Pickled turnip tops can be used as a condiment or added to salads for a tangy flavor.

## Instructions:
1. Cut off the withered leaves or branches from the turnip tops.
2. Bring a pot of water to a boil.
3. Add the turnip tops to the boiling water and cook until they are tender. This should take about 5-7 minutes.
4. Drain the cooked turnip tops well and let them cool completely.

6. In a separate bowl, mix together white wine vinegar and salt. The ratio should be approximately 1 part vinegar to 1/2 part salt, but you can adjust according to your taste.
7. Pour the vinegar and salt mixture over the turnip tops, making sure they are completely submerged.
8. Seal the jar or container tightly and let the turnip tops pickle in the refrigerator for at least 24 hours before using.
