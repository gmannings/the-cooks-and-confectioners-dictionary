# Lamb like Menilon

## Description
Lamb like Menilon is a dish from the 18th century that involves marinating lamb in blood and then baking it with various spices and herbs. The marinade gives the lamb a unique flavor and the spices add depth and aroma to the dish.

## Options and commentary
- Instead of using blood, you can marinate the lamb in red wine or a mixture of red wine and vinegar.
- Alkanet root and turnsole were commonly used as natural food coloring agents in the 18th century. You can omit them if you don't have access to them.
- The cooking time may vary depending on the size and thickness of the lamb.

## Ingredients:
- 1 bone-in lamb leg or shoulder
- 1 cup red wine or red wine vinegar
- 1 cup small beer (a light beer)
- 1 cup white vinegar
- Alkanet root or turnsole (optional, for color)
- 1 teaspoon black pepper
- 1 teaspoon ground cloves
- 1 teaspoon ground mace
- 1 cup claret (red wine)
- 4 tablespoons butter
- Sprigs of rosemary

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F).

2. Bone the lamb leg or shoulder, or ask your butcher to do it for you.

3. In a large bowl, combine the red wine or red wine vinegar, small beer, and white vinegar. Mix well.

4. Dip the lamb in the marinade, making sure it is fully coated. Let it marinate in the refrigerator overnight.

5. If using, add a small piece of alkanet root or turnsole to the marinade to give the lamb a reddish color. This step is optional.

6. Remove the lamb from the marinade and pat it dry with paper towels.

7. In a separate bowl, combine the black pepper, ground cloves, and ground mace. Mix well.

8. Rub the spice mixture all over the lamb, making sure to coat it evenly.

9. Place the lamb in a baking dish and pour the claret over it.

10. Dot the lamb with butter and place sprigs of rosemary on top.

11. Cover the baking dish with foil and bake in the preheated oven for about 2-3 hours, or until the lamb is tender and cooked to your liking. 

12. Remove the foil during the last 30 minutes of cooking to allow the lamb to brown.

13. Once cooked, remove the lamb from the oven and let it rest for a few minutes before serving.

## Cooking time
Approximately 2-3 hours.
