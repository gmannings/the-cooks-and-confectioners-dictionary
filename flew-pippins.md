# Flew Pippins

## Description
Flew Pippins is a sweet and tangy dessert made with boiled apples and a syrup made from sugar, lemon juice, and lemon peel. The apples are cooked until they are tender and then coated with a jelly-like syrup. This dish can be served cold as a refreshing dessert.

## Ingredients:
- 1 kg apples (preferably tart apples like Granny Smith)
- 1 liter water
- 1 liter white wine
- 1 kg double-refined sugar
- Zest and juice of 2 lemons
- Optional: a small amount of ambergris (a fragrant substance derived from whale intestines), dissolved in lemon juice

## Instructions:
1. Peel the apples and cut them into halves or quarters.
2. In a large pot, combine the water and white wine in equal quantities.
3. Add the apples to the pot and bring the liquid to a boil.
4. Reduce the heat to a simmer and cook the apples until they are tender. This should take about 15-20 minutes.
5. While the apples are cooking, prepare the syrup. In a separate pot, combine the double-refined sugar with an equal amount of water.
6. Heat the sugar and water mixture over medium heat, stirring until the sugar has dissolved completely.
7. Once the sugar has dissolved, increase the heat and bring the syrup to a boil. Skim off any impurities that rise to the surface.
8. Add the lemon zest and juice to the syrup and continue boiling until it has a slightly thick consistency.
9. If desired, dissolve a small amount of ambergris in the lemon juice and add it to the syrup. This is an optional ingredient that adds a unique fragrance to the dish.
10. Once the apples are tender, remove them from the pot and set them aside to cool.
11. Once the syrup has reached the desired consistency, remove it from the heat and allow it to cool slightly.
12. Place the cooled apples in a serving dish and pour the syrup over them, coating them evenly.
13. Allow the dish to cool completely and the syrup to set into a jelly-like consistency.
14. Serve the Flew Pippins cold, with the jelly-like syrup coating the apples.
