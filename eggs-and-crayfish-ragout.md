# Eggs and Crayfish Ragout

## Description
This recipe is a modernized version of an 18th-century dish called "To dzels Eggs and Cray-fith." It features poached eggs served with a flavorful ragout made with crayfish tails, artichoke bottoms, truffles, and mushrooms. The ragout is seasoned with salt, pepper, and herbs, and then simmered in fish broth. The dish is elegant and delicious, perfect for a special brunch or dinner.

## Options and commentary
- You can use fresh or frozen crayfish tails for this recipe. If crayfish is not available, you can substitute with shrimp or lobster.
- If you can't find artichoke bottoms, you can use canned artichoke hearts instead.
- Truffles can be quite expensive and hard to find. If you don't have access to truffles, you can use truffle oil or omit them altogether.
- The ragout can be served over poached eggs, as described in the original recipe, or you can serve it with toast or crusty bread for a heartier meal.

## Ingredients:
- 250g crayfish tails, cooked and peeled
- 4 artichoke bottoms, sliced into pieces
- 4-6 truffles, thinly sliced (or 1-2 teaspoons truffle oil)
- 200g mushrooms, sliced
- 2 tablespoons butter
- 250ml fish broth
- Salt and pepper to taste
- A bundle of fresh herbs (such as parsley, thyme, and bay leaves)
- 6 fresh eggs
- Water for poaching eggs

## Instructions:
1. In a saucepan, melt the butter over medium heat.
2. Add the crayfish tails, artichoke bottoms, truffles (or truffle oil), and mushrooms to the saucepan. Cook for a few minutes until the mushrooms are tender.
3. Pour in the fish broth and add the fresh herbs. Season with salt and pepper.
4. Reduce the heat to low and let the ragout simmer for about 15 minutes, allowing the flavors to meld together. Remove any excess fat that rises to the surface.
5. While the ragout is simmering, prepare the poached eggs. Fill a large pot with water and bring it to a gentle simmer.
6. Crack each egg into a small bowl or ramekin.
7. Create a gentle whirlpool in the simmering water by stirring it with a spoon. Carefully slide each egg into the whirlpool, one at a time. The swirling water will help the eggs form a nice shape.
8. Poach the eggs for about 3-4 minutes for a soft yolk or longer if desired. Remove the poached eggs with a slotted spoon and place them on a plate lined with paper towels to drain excess water.
9. Arrange the poached eggs on a serving dish.
10. Remove the bundle of fresh herbs from the ragout and discard.
11. Pour the hot ragout over the poached eggs, making sure to distribute the crayfish tails, artichoke bottoms, truffles, and mushrooms evenly.
12. Serve the eggs and crayfish ragout immediately in individual dishes.
