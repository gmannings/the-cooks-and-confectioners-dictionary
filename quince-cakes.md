# Quince Cakes

## Description
Quince Cakes are a sweet treat made from quinces, a fruit that is similar to apples and pears. The quinces are boiled until soft, then mashed and mixed with sugar syrup. The mixture is then shaped into cakes and baked until firm. These cakes have a delicate flavor and a beautiful white color.

## Options and commentary
- You can clarify the sugar syrup by adding egg whites, which will help achieve a whiter color.
- You can also add spices such as cinnamon or nutmeg to enhance the flavor of the quince cakes.

## Ingredients:
- 2 liters of water
- 500 grams of sugar
- 25 large quinces
- Optional: 2 egg whites
- Optional: spices such as cinnamon or nutmeg

## Instructions:
1. In a large pot, bring the water to a boil.
2. Add the sugar to the boiling water and stir until it dissolves completely. This will create a sugar syrup.
3. Peel the quinces and remove the cores.
4. Place the quinces in a separate pot and cover them with water.
5. Bring the pot to a boil and cook the quinces until they become soft. This may take about 30 minutes.
6. Remove the quinces from the pot and transfer them to a bowl.
7. Mash the quinces with a fork or use a blender to create a smooth pulp.
8. Add the quince pulp to the boiling sugar syrup and water mixture. Let it simmer for a while to infuse the flavors.
9. If desired, whisk the egg whites until frothy and add them to the sugar syrup and quince mixture. This will help clarify the syrup and make the cakes whiter.
10. Optional: Add spices such as cinnamon or nutmeg to the mixture for added flavor.
11. Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F).
12. Line tin plates with parchment paper or grease them with butter to prevent sticking.
13. Spoon the quince mixture onto the tin plates, shaping them into cakes.
14. Place the tin plates in the preheated oven and bake for about 30-40 minutes, or until the cakes are firm and golden.
15. Remove the quince cakes from the oven and let them cool completely before serving.
