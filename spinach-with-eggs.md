# Spinach with Eggs

## Description
Spinach with Eggs is a classic dish that combines saut√©ed spinach with poached eggs. The spinach is cooked with cream, butter, and seasonings, and then topped with perfectly poached eggs. It can be served as a light supper or as a second course in a meal.

## Ingredients:
- 500g spinach
- 120ml cream
- Salt, to taste
- Pepper, to taste
- 1/4 teaspoon grated nutmeg
- 115g butter
- 4 slices of French bread
- 6 poached eggs

## Instructions:
1. Pick the spinach leaves and wash them thoroughly to remove any dirt or grit.
2. In a large pot, bring water to a boil and blanch the spinach for about a minute. This will help to soften the leaves and remove any bitterness.
3. Drain the spinach and squeeze out any excess water. Mince the spinach finely.
4. In a saucepan, combine the minced spinach, cream, salt, pepper, and grated nutmeg. Stir well to combine.
5. Add the butter to the saucepan and place it over medium heat. Allow the mixture to stew for about 15 minutes, stirring occasionally.
6. While the spinach is stewing, cut the French bread into small pieces, about the length and thickness of your finger.
7. Once the spinach is cooked, transfer it to a serving dish. Arrange the pieces of French bread on top of the spinach.
8. Poach the eggs in a separate pot of simmering water until the whites are set and the yolks are still runny.
9. Carefully place the poached eggs on top of the spinach and bread.
10. Serve the Spinach with Eggs as a light supper or as a second course in a meal.
