# Roasted Calves Feet

## Description
Roasted Calves Feet is a dish made from tender calves feet that are blanched, larded with bacon, and then roasted. The feet are served with a sauce made from butter, vinegar, and cinnamon.

## Ingredients:
- 4 calves feet
- 100g bacon, cut into small lardons
- 50g butter
- 2 tablespoons vinegar
- 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 180Â°C.
2. In a large pot, bring water to a boil and add the calves feet. Boil them until they are very tender, about 2-3 hours.
3. Remove the calves feet from the pot and let them cool. Once they are cold, blanch them by placing them in a bowl of ice water for a few minutes. This will help remove any impurities and make the feet more tender.
4. Take the cooled calves feet and lard them by inserting small lardons of bacon into the meat. Make sure to lard them thickly to add flavor and moisture.
5. Place the larded calves feet on a small spit and secure them in place.
6. Roast the calves feet in the preheated oven for about 45 minutes to 1 hour, or until they are golden brown and crispy on the outside.
7. While the calves feet are roasting, prepare the sauce. In a small saucepan, melt the butter over low heat.
8. Add the vinegar and ground cinnamon to the melted butter and stir until well combined. Cook the sauce for a few minutes until it thickens slightly.
9. Once the calves feet are done roasting, remove them from the oven and place them on a serving platter.
10. Pour the prepared sauce over the roasted calves feet, making sure to coat them evenly.
11. Serve the Roasted Calves Feet immediately.
