# Thickened Citrus Butter

## Description
This recipe is for a thickened citrus butter that can be used as a spread or a sauce. It is made by thickening butter with the juice of orange or lemon, vinegar or verjuice. The resulting butter is thick and will not turn to oil even when heated multiple times.

## Ingredients:
- 250g unsalted butter
- Juice of 1 orange or lemon
- 1 tablespoon vinegar or verjuice

## Instructions:
1. In a small saucepan, melt the butter over low heat until it becomes liquid.
2. Once the butter has melted, continue to heat it over low heat until it thickens. This may take around 10-15 minutes. Stir occasionally to prevent the butter from burning.
3. Once the butter has thickened and can be easily cut with a knife, remove it from the heat.
4. Squeeze the juice of an orange or lemon into the thickened butter. Stir well to combine.
5. Add 1 tablespoon of vinegar or verjuice to the mixture. Stir again to incorporate.
6. Return the saucepan to low heat and heat the butter mixture again until it is warm. Be careful not to overheat or boil the mixture.
7. Once the butter is warm, remove it from the heat and transfer it to a jar or container for storage.
8. Allow the butter to cool completely before using or refrigerating.

## Cooking time
Approximately 20-25 minutes
