# Patty of Lobsters

## Description
A patty made with boiled lobster meat, flavored with broth, French roll crust, butter, salt, pepper, anchovy, and lemon. The patty is baked in the oven and served with a sauce made from the reserved broth.

## Ingredients:
- 2 lobsters
- 1 French roll
- 1 cup broth or gravy
- 1 tablespoon butter
- Salt and pepper to taste
- 1 anchovy, minced
- Juice of 1 lemon
- Pastry for lining the tart pan
- Additional butter for the sauce

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F).
2. Boil the lobsters until cooked through. Remove the meat from the shells and cut it into small pieces.
3. Take the small claws and the lobster spawn and pound them in a mortar until smooth.
4. In a saucepan, combine the pounded lobster claws and spawn with the broth or gravy and the crust of the French roll. 
5. Bring the mixture to a boil and then strain it to the thickness of cream.
6. Reserve half of the strained mixture to use as a sauce later.
7. To the remaining half of the strained mixture, add the lobster meat, butter, salt, pepper, minced anchovy, and lemon juice.
8. Place the saucepan over low heat and cook until the butter is melted. Remove from heat and let it cool.
9. Line a tart pan with pastry, making sure it covers the bottom and sides of the pan.
10. Pour the lobster mixture into the lined tart pan.
11. Cover the patty with another layer of pastry, sealing the edges.
12. Place the patty in the preheated oven and bake for three-quarters of an hour.
13. After baking, cut up the lid of the patty.
14. In a separate saucepan, heat the reserved strained mixture with a little butter until it reaches the thickness of cream.
15. Pour the sauce into the patty, squeeze in a little lemon juice, and place the cut-up lid on top, spacing the pieces about two inches apart.
16. Serve the patty hot.
