## Instructions:
### Option 1: Roasted sweetbreads with bacon and ragout
1. Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F).
2. Prepare the sweetbreads by removing any membranes or excess fat. Rinse them under cold water and pat dry with paper towels.
3. Cut the sweetbreads into thick slices.
4. Wrap each sweetbread slice with a strip of bacon and secure with toothpicks.
5. Place the bacon-wrapped sweetbread slices on a baking sheet and roast in the preheated oven for about 20-25 minutes, or until the bacon is crispy and the sweetbreads are cooked through.
6. While the sweetbreads are roasting, prepare the ragout.
7. In a saucepan, melt the butter over medium heat. Add the chopped onion, minced garlic, diced carrot, and diced celery. Cook until the vegetables are softened.
8. Sprinkle the flour over the vegetables and stir well to combine.
9. Gradually pour in the chicken or vegetable broth, stirring constantly to avoid lumps.
10. Bring the mixture to a simmer and cook for about 5 minutes, or until the sauce has thickened.
11. Season the ragout with salt and pepper to taste.
12. Once the sweetbreads are done, remove them from the oven and let them rest for a few minutes.
13. Serve the roasted sweetbreads with the bacon and spoon the ragout over the top.

### Option 2: Fried sweetbreads with marinade
1. Prepare the sweetbreads by removing any membranes or excess fat. Rinse them under cold water and pat dry with paper towels.
2. Cut the sweetbreads into thin slices.
3. In a shallow dish, combine the olive oil, lemon juice, dried herbs, salt, and pepper to make the marinade.
4. Place the sweetbread slices in the marinade and let them marinate for at least 30 minutes, or up to overnight in the refrigerator.
5. Heat vegetable oil in a frying pan over medium heat.
6. Remove the sweetbread slices from the marinade and coat them in flour.
7. Fry the sweetbread slices in the hot oil until golden brown and crispy on both sides. This should take about 2-3 minutes per side.
8. Remove the fried sweetbreads from the pan and place them on a paper towel-lined plate to drain excess oil.
9. In the same pan, fry some parsley leaves until crispy.
10. Serve the fried sweetbreads with the fried parsley and a squeeze of lemon juice.
