# Cream Custard with Almonds and Citron

## Description
This recipe is a modernized version of an 18th-century cream custard. It is a rich and creamy dessert made with cream, eggs, almonds, and citron. The custard is flavored with orange-flower water and sweetened with sugar. It is then baked in the oven until set.

## Options and commentary
- You can substitute the cream with a combination of milk and heavy cream for a slightly lighter custard.
- If you don't have orange-flower water, you can use vanilla extract as a substitute.
- Musk-plums are not commonly available, so you can omit them or use a small amount of ground cardamom for a similar flavor.

## Ingredients:
- 2 cups heavy cream
- 4 egg yolks
- 1/2 cup blanched almonds
- 1 tablespoon orange-flower water (or vanilla extract)
- 1/4 cup Naples biscuit (or ladyfingers), crushed
- 1/4 cup green citron, finely chopped
- 1/4 cup sugar
- Ground cardamom (optional)

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 350°F (180°C).
2. In a saucepan, heat the cream over medium heat until it starts to simmer. Remove from heat.
3. In a bowl, beat the egg yolks until smooth. Gradually pour the hot cream into the egg yolks, whisking constantly.
4. Return the mixture to the saucepan and cook over low heat, stirring constantly, until it thickens and coats the back of a spoon. Be careful not to let it boil.
5. Remove from heat and stir in the blanched almonds and orange-flower water.
6. In a separate bowl, combine the crushed Naples biscuit, chopped citron, and sugar. Add a pinch of ground cardamom if desired.
7. Grease individual ramekins or a baking dish with butter.
8. Divide the almond and cream mixture among the ramekins or pour it into the baking dish.
9. Sprinkle the biscuit and citron mixture over the top of the custard.
10. Place the ramekins or baking dish in a larger baking pan. Pour hot water into the larger pan to create a water bath.
11. Carefully transfer the pan to the preheated oven and bake for about 30-35 minutes, or until the custard is set and lightly golden on top.
12. Remove from the oven and let cool. Serve chilled.
