# Preserved Apricots in Ears

## Description
Preserved apricots in ears are a sweet and tangy treat made by preserving apricots and arranging them in a unique "ear" shape. The apricots are cooked in a syrup and then carefully arranged to create a visually appealing presentation.

## Ingredients:
- 1 kg apricots
- 500 g sugar
- 500 ml water

## Instructions:
1. Wash the apricots and remove any stems or leaves.
2. In a large pot, combine the sugar and water. Heat over medium heat until the sugar has dissolved completely.
3. Add the apricots to the pot and bring the mixture to a boil. Reduce the heat and simmer for about 10 minutes, or until the apricots are tender.
4. Remove the apricots from the syrup and set aside to cool slightly.
5. Carefully separate one half of each apricot from the other, without breaking it off completely. The halves should still be touching at one end, creating the "ear" shape.
6. Arrange the apricot halves on a serving platter, with the open sides facing up and touching each other at one end.
7. Pour some of the syrup over the arranged apricots to glaze them.
8. Allow the preserved apricots in ears to cool completely before serving.
