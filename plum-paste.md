# Plum Paste

## Description
Plum paste is a sweet and fruity confection made from plums and sugar. It has a smooth and dense texture, similar to a fruit leather or fruit roll-up. Plum paste can be enjoyed on its own as a sweet treat or used as a filling or topping for cakes, pastries, or desserts.

## Options and commentary
- You can use fresh plums or plum puree as a base for the paste.
- If fresh plums are not available, you can use plum jam or preserves as a substitute.
- Feathered sugar refers to powdered sugar or icing sugar.
- The paste can be shaped into various forms such as hearts, squares, or flowers using molds or cutters.
- The drying process can be done in a low-temperature oven or a food dehydrator.

## Ingredients:
- 500g plums, pitted and pureed (or plum jam/preserves)
- 250g powdered sugar (icing sugar)

## Instructions:
1. In a large saucepan, combine the plum puree (or jam/preserves) and powdered sugar.
2. Cook the mixture over medium heat, stirring constantly, until the sugar has dissolved and the mixture starts to thicken. It should start to pull away from the bottom of the pan.
3. Reduce the heat to low and let the mixture simmer for a few more minutes, stirring occasionally.
4. If using molds, lightly grease them with cooking spray or oil. If using slates, line them with parchment paper.
5. Pour the plum paste mixture into the molds or onto the prepared slates, spreading it evenly.
6. Place the molds or slates in a low-temperature oven (around 100Â°C) or a food dehydrator.
7. Dry the plum paste for several hours or until it is firm and no longer sticky to the touch. The exact drying time will depend on the thickness of the paste and the drying method used.
8. Once dry, remove the plum paste from the molds or slates and store in an airtight container.

## Cooking time
- Cooking time: Approximately 20-30 minutes
- Drying time: Several hours (varies depending on thickness and drying method)
