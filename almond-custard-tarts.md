# Almond Custard Tarts

## Description
These almond custard tarts are a delicious and creamy dessert. The tart shells are filled with a mixture of pounded almonds, cream, eggs, sugar, and nutmeg. They are then baked to perfection in the oven.

## Options and commentary
- You can use store-bought tart shells or make your own from scratch.
- If you don't have a stone mortar, you can use a food processor to pound the curd.
- Feel free to adjust the amount of sugar and nutmeg to suit your taste preferences.

## Ingredients:
- 3 quarts (2.8 liters) of milk
- Rennet (amount not specified)
- 1 pound (454 grams) of curd
- 1/2 pound (227 grams) of almonds
- Rosewater
- 1 pint (473 milliliters) of cream
- 10 egg yolks
- 3/4 pound (340 grams) of sugar
- 1 nutmeg

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 350°F (180°C).
2. In a large bowl, combine the milk and rennet. Let it sit until the milk becomes tender and curdles.
3. Strain the whey from the curd using a strainer.
4. Press the curd to remove any excess liquid and transfer it to dry cloths. Allow it to drain until it is no longer wet.
5. Pound the curd in a stone mortar (or use a food processor) until it resembles butter.
6. In a separate mortar, pound the almonds with a splash of rosewater until they form a paste.
7. In a mixing bowl, combine the pounded almonds, cream, egg yolks, sugar, and grated nutmeg. Mix well until all the ingredients are thoroughly combined.
8. Add the pounded curd to the almond mixture and mix until smooth.
9. Fill your tart shells with the almond custard mixture.
10. Place the filled tart shells on a baking sheet and transfer them to the preheated oven.
11. Bake for approximately 30 minutes or until the custard is set and the tart shells are golden brown.
12. Remove from the oven and allow the tarts to cool before serving.
