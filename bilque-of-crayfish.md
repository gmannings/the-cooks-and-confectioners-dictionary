# Bilque of Crayfish

## Description
A rich and flavorful dish made with crayfish tails, truffles, mushrooms, and a creamy crayfish cullis. Served with a garnish of pickled crayfish and artichoke bottoms.

## Options and commentary
- If crayfish is not available, you can substitute it with shrimp or lobster tails.
- Truffles can be quite expensive and hard to find. You can use truffle oil or mushroom powder as a substitute for truffles.
- The dish can be served as a main course or as a fancy appetizer.
- Cooking time may vary depending on the size and freshness of the crayfish or substitute seafood.

## Ingredients:
- 500g crayfish tails (or substitute with shrimp or lobster tails)
- 50g truffles, sliced (or substitute with truffle oil or mushroom powder)
- 100g mushrooms, sliced
- 1 onion, sliced
- 2 carrots, sliced
- 2 parsnips, sliced
- 50g butter
- 1 liter fish broth
- Salt to taste
- 2-3 cloves
- Fresh basil and parsley, chopped
- 1 leek, sliced
- 12 sweet almonds, blanched and pounded
- Crusty bread for croutons
- Asparagus tops
- 6 artichoke bottoms
- Carp milt (optional)

## Instructions:
1. Wash the crayfish tails (or substitute seafood) thoroughly.
2. Boil the crayfish tails in a large pot of salted water until cooked. Remove from the water and let them cool.
3. Remove the claws from the largest crayfish tails, leaving the tails hanging at the shells. Completely remove the tails from the smaller crayfish tails.
4. Keep the shells to make the cullis.
5. In a mortar, pound the blanched almonds with the crayfish shells until they form a paste.
6. In a saucepan, melt the butter and sauté the sliced onion, carrots, and parsnips until they begin to turn brown.
7. Add the fish broth to the saucepan and season with salt, cloves, basil, parsley, and the sliced leek.
8. Simmer the mixture for a few minutes, then add the pounded almonds and crayfish shell paste.
9. Let the cullis simmer for a while, then strain it through a sieve into a pan. This cullis can be used in various meagre soups and ragouts.
10. In another saucepan, melt a little butter and sauté the crayfish tails, sliced truffles, and mushrooms.
11. Add a bunch of sweet herbs to the saucepan and simmer over a gentle fire.
12. Once cooked, add the asparagus tops and artichoke bottoms to the saucepan.
13. Thicken the mixture with the previously prepared cullis.
14. In a separate pan, simmer crusty bread in fish broth until it sticks to the bottom of the dish.
15. Arrange the pickled crayfish tails around the border of a serving dish.
16. Place a stuffed roll of bread in the middle of the dish and arrange the artichoke bottoms and pieces of carp milt around it.
17. Pour the ragout and crayfish cullis over the dish.
18. Serve the bilque of crayfish hot.

## Cooking time
Approximately 1-2 hours, depending on the cooking time of the seafood and the preparation of the cullis.
