# Pigeons in Fricandeaux

## Description
Pigeons that are larded with bacon and cooked in a stewpan with leeks and broth until browned. Served with a sauce made from the pan drippings and broth.

## Ingredients:
- 2 large pigeons
- 4-6 strips of bacon, cut into small lardons
- 2 leeks, cleaned and sliced
- 2 cups good broth (chicken or vegetable)
- Salt and pepper to taste

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F).
2. Take the pigeons and truss them, tucking their legs into their bodies.
3. Cut the pigeons in half and lard them by inserting the bacon lardons into the meat.
4. In a large stewpan, place the larded pigeons with the larded side facing downwards.
5. Add the sliced leeks and pour in the broth.
6. Cover the stewpan and simmer over a gentle fire for about 1 hour or until the pigeons are cooked through.
7. Once the pigeons are cooked, increase the heat to medium-high to evaporate any remaining broth and brown the pigeons.
8. Remove the pigeons from the stewpan and transfer them to a serving dish.
9. Remove any excess fat from the stewpan and add more broth and veal gravy to deglaze the pan.
10. Add a few peppercorns and cook over medium heat for a minute or two.
11. Pour the sauce over the pigeons and serve them in individual plates or dishes.
