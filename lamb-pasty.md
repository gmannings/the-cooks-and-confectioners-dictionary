# Lamb Pasty

## Description
A lamb pasty is a savory pie filled with seasoned lamb and suet. The pastry is folded over the filling and baked until golden and crispy. The addition of vinegar, eggs, and sugar adds a tangy and slightly sweet flavor to the pasty.

## Options and commentary
- Instead of lamb, you can use other meats such as beef or chicken.
- If you prefer a vegetarian option, you can replace the meat with a mixture of vegetables like potatoes, carrots, and peas.
- The suet can be substituted with butter or vegetable shortening for a lighter pastry.
- You can choose to add either sugar or gravy to the filling, depending on your taste preferences.
- The baking time may vary depending on the size and thickness of the pasty.

## Ingredients:
- 500g lamb, boneless and cut into small cubes
- 100g beef suet, grated or diced
- Salt and pepper to taste
- 1 teaspoon minced thyme
- 1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg
- 1/2 teaspoon ground cloves
- 1/2 teaspoon ground mace
- 1 sheet of puff pastry
- 2 tablespoons vinegar
- 2 egg yolks, beaten
- 1 tablespoon sugar (optional)
- 100ml good quality gravy or 100ml Claret wine (optional)

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F).
2. In a bowl, mix together the lamb cubes, grated beef suet, salt, pepper, minced thyme, nutmeg, cloves, and mace until well combined.
3. Roll out the puff pastry sheet on a lightly floured surface to a thickness of about 1/4 inch.
4. Place the rolled-out pastry sheet on a baking tray lined with parchment paper.
5. Spread the seasoned lamb mixture evenly over the bottom half of the pastry, leaving a border around the edges.
6. Fold the top half of the pastry over the lamb filling, pressing the edges together to seal.
7. Crimp the edges of the pastry to create a decorative border.
8. Bake the pasty in the preheated oven for about 40-45 minutes, or until the pastry is golden brown and crispy.
9. In a small bowl, mix together the vinegar, beaten egg yolks, and sugar (if using).
10. Remove the pasty from the oven and carefully lift the top crust.
11. Pour the vinegar and egg mixture into the pasty, spreading it evenly over the lamb filling.
12. If you prefer, you can omit the sugar and instead pour in the good quality gravy or the baking of the bones in Claret wine.
13. Place the top crust back on the pasty and return it to the oven for an additional 5 minutes to allow the filling to set.
14. Remove the pasty from the oven and let it cool for a few minutes before serving.
