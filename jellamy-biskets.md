# Jellamy Biskets

## Description
Jellamy Biskets are delicate, sweet biscuits that were popular in the 18th century. They are made with Jeffamin flowers (a type of jasmine) or English jasmine flowers, which are beaten with egg whites and powdered sugar. The biscuits are then baked until they are crisp and golden. Jellamy Biskets are a delightful treat that can be enjoyed on their own or served with tea or coffee.

## Options and commentary
- If you can find Spanish Jeffamin flowers, they are the best choice for this recipe. However, if you cannot find them, you can use English Jeffamin flowers or English jasmine flowers as a substitute.
- The original recipe calls for baking the biscuits in a "gentle oven," which likely refers to a low to moderate temperature. In modern terms, you can bake them at 160°C (325°F) for about 15-20 minutes, or until they are golden brown.

## Ingredients:
- 50g Jeffamin flowers or English jasmine flowers
- 2 egg whites
- 100g powdered sugar
- Extra powdered sugar for dusting

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 160°C (325°F).
2. Pick the Jeffamin flowers or English jasmine flowers, discarding any stems or leaves.
3. Place the flowers in a marble mortar and beat them well until they form a paste-like consistency.
4. In a separate bowl, whisk the egg whites until they become frothy.
5. Gradually add the powdered sugar to the egg whites, whisking continuously until the mixture becomes glossy and stiff peaks form.
6. Gently fold the beaten flower paste into the egg white mixture until well combined.
7. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or silicone mat.
8. Sprinkle a layer of powdered sugar on the lined baking sheet.
9. Drop spoonfuls of the biscuit mixture onto the powdered sugar, leaving some space between each biscuit.
10. Sprinkle more powdered sugar on top of the biscuit mixture.
11. Place the baking sheet in the preheated oven and bake for 15-20 minutes, or until the biscuits are golden brown and crisp.
12. Remove from the oven and allow the biscuits to cool completely on a wire rack.
13. Once cooled, gently remove the biscuits from the baking sheet and store in an airtight container.
