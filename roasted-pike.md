# Roasted Pike

## Description
This recipe is for roasting a pike, a type of freshwater fish. The pike is stuffed with a mixture of seasoned oysters, onion, winter savory, and thyme, then roasted until cooked through. The stuffing is used to make a sauce to serve with the roasted pike.

## Ingredients:
- 1 whole pike, scraped and gutted
- Pickled herring, for larding the back of the pike
- Claret wine, for basting
- Large oysters, seasoned with pepper and nutmeg
- Slices of onion
- Winter savory
- Thyme
- Butter, for basting and making sauce
- Salt and pepper, to taste

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F).
2. Lard the back of the pike with pickled herring by inserting small strips of herring into the flesh.
3. In a bowl, mix together the seasoned oysters, slices of onion, winter savory, and thyme.
4. Stuff the belly of the pike with the oyster mixture.
5. Sew up the pike's belly to secure the stuffing inside.
6. Place two flat sticks, about the width of a lath, on either side of the pike to support its sides during roasting.
7. Tie rosemary and bay leaves around the pike to protect it from excessive heat.
8. Place the pike on a roasting rack and baste it with a mixture of melted butter and claret wine.
9. Roast the pike in the preheated oven for approximately 20 minutes per 500g (1 lb) of fish, or until it is cooked through and flakes easily with a fork. Baste the pike with the butter and wine mixture every 10 minutes during cooking.
10. Once the pike is roasted, remove it from the oven and transfer it to a serving dish.
11. Remove the stuffing from the pike's belly and set it aside.
12. In a saucepan, combine the stuffing, any drippings from the roasted pike, a little beaten butter, and a splash of claret wine. Cook the sauce over low heat until heated through and well combined.
13. Pour the sauce over the roasted pike and serve.
