# Roasted Tench

## Description
Roasted Tench is a classic dish from the 18th century. Tench is a freshwater fish known for its delicate flavor. The fish is cleaned, stuffed with herbs, and roasted on a spit. It is basted with a mixture of butter, vinegar or verjuice, and salt to keep it moist and add flavor.

## Ingredients:
- 1 Tench (approximately 500g)
- Fresh herbs (such as parsley, thyme, and dill)
- 50g butter
- 2 tablespoons vinegar or verjuice
- Salt to taste

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 180Â°C.
2. Clean the Tench thoroughly, removing any slime. Make a small hole near the gills and carefully remove the guts. Cleanse the throat as well.
3. Stuff the belly of the Tench with fresh herbs.
4. Tie the fish to a spit using two or three splinters, ensuring it is secure.
5. Place the spit with the Tench in the preheated oven.
6. In a small saucepan, melt the butter over low heat. Add the vinegar or verjuice and salt, stirring to combine.
7. Every 10 minutes, baste the Tench with the butter mixture to keep it moist and add flavor.
8. Continue roasting the Tench for approximately 30-40 minutes, or until it is cooked through and flakes easily with a fork.
9. Remove the Tench from the oven and let it rest for a few minutes before serving.
