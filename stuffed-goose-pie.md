# Stuffed Goose Pie

## Description
This recipe is for a traditional 18th century dish called Stuffed Goose Pie. It involves boning a goose, stuffing it with seasoned rabbit pieces, and baking it in a pie crust. The pie is then filled with clarified butter after baking.

## Options and commentary
- Instead of boning a goose, you can use boneless goose meat or substitute it with boneless chicken or turkey.
- If you prefer a different type of meat, you can use boneless pork loin or beef instead of the rabbit.
- The recipe calls for a large amount of butter, but you can reduce the amount if desired.
