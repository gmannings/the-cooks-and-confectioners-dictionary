# Carp a la daube

## Description
Carp a la daube is a classic French dish that features a carp fish stuffed with a flavorful mixture of fish flesh, herbs, spices, and breadcrumbs. The stuffed carp is then stewed in white wine with a variety of seasonings and served with a ragout made from carp milt, crayfish tails, mushrooms, truffles, and artichoke bottoms.

## Options and commentary
- Instead of using carp, you can use any other firm-fleshed fish such as sea bass or snapper.
- If you don't have access to crayfish, you can substitute with shrimp or lobster.
- The ragout can be customized with your choice of vegetables and mushrooms.
- This dish is traditionally served as a main course.

## Ingredients:
- 1 carp (or any firm-fleshed fish)
- Flesh of 2 soles
- Flesh of 1 pike
- A handful of chives, finely chopped
- Salt and pepper to taste
- 1/2 teaspoon ground spice blend (such as allspice or quatre épices)
- 1/4 teaspoon grated nutmeg
- 2 tablespoons fresh butter
- 1/4 cup breadcrumbs
- 1/4 cup cream
- 1 cup white wine
- 4 cloves
- 2 tablespoons good quality fresh butter
- 1 bunch of fresh herbs (such as parsley, thyme, and bay leaves)
- 2 slices of lemon
- 1 cup carp milt (fish roe)
- 1 cup crayfish tails
- 1 cup sliced mushrooms
- 1/4 cup sliced truffles (optional)
- 1/4 cup sliced morel mushrooms (optional)
- 1/4 cup sliced artichoke bottoms (optional)
- 1 cup fish stock or vegetable stock
- Salt and pepper to taste

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F).
2. Bone the soles and pike, and finely chop the flesh.
3. In a mixing bowl, combine the chopped fish flesh, chives, salt, pepper, ground spice blend, grated nutmeg, fresh butter, breadcrumbs, and cream. Mix well to form a smooth farce (stuffing). Thicken the farce with yolks of eggs if desired.
4. Clean the carp and remove the scales. Make a lengthwise incision along the belly of the fish to create a cavity for stuffing.
5. Fill the body cavity of the carp with the prepared farce.
6. In an oval stew-pan, heat the white wine over a gentle fire. Season the wine with salt, pepper, cloves, good fresh butter, a bunch of sweet herbs, and slices of lemon.
7. Place the stuffed carp in the stew-pan and cover with a lid. Stew the carp over low heat for about 30-40 minutes or until the fish is cooked through and tender.
8. While the carp is stewing, prepare the ragout. In a separate saucepan, melt the fresh butter and add the carp milt, crayfish tails, sliced mushrooms, truffles, morel mushrooms, and artichoke bottoms. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Cook the ragout over medium heat until the ingredients are well-seasoned and cooked through.
9. Add the fish stock or vegetable stock to the ragout and simmer for an additional 5 minutes.
10. Transfer the stewed carp to an oval dish and pour the prepared ragout over it.
11. Serve the carp a la daube hot as a main course.
