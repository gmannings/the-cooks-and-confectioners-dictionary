# Hogoe

## Description
Hogoe is a dish made from minced leg of mutton and beef suet, flavored with shallots, spinach, savory, and thyme. The mixture is shaped into a ball and stuffed into a cabbage. The cabbage is then boiled and served with sausages and a flavorful sauce.

## Options and commentary
- You can use ground lamb instead of minced leg of mutton.
- If you prefer a leaner option, you can use ground turkey or chicken instead of beef suet.
- Feel free to adjust the seasonings to your taste.
- Serve the Hogoe with your choice of sausages and a sauce of your liking.

## Ingredients:
- 1 leg of mutton (or ground lamb)
- 2 pounds of beef suet (or ground turkey/chicken)
- Shallots, finely chopped
- Spinach, finely chopped
- Savory, finely chopped
- Thyme, finely chopped
- Salt and pepper
- 6-8 egg yolks
- 1 cabbage
- Duck's head (optional)
- Sausages
- Flour
- Nutmeg
- Butter
- Anchovies

## Instructions:
1. Remove the skin from the leg of mutton and the upper knuckle. Mince the flesh very finely.
2. In a large bowl, combine the minced mutton, beef suet (or ground turkey/chicken), finely chopped shallots, spinach, savory, and thyme.
3. Season the mixture with salt and pepper.
4. Add the egg yolks to the mixture and mix well until everything is combined and forms a ball.
5. Take a cabbage and carefully open the leaves. Cut out the middle to create a hole to put the ball of meat in.
6. Shape the meat mixture into the form of a duck, making it as close to the shape as possible.
7. If using, boil a duck's head separately and attach it to the meat ball using a skewer.
8. Tie up the cabbage tightly to enclose the meat ball.
9. Place the cabbage in a large pot of boiling water and cook for about 1-2 hours, or until the meat is cooked through.
10. While the cabbage is cooking, fry the sausages in a pan until browned.
11. In a separate saucepan, melt a good quantity of butter. Add the flour and nutmeg, and cook for a minute to make a roux.
12. Add the anchovies to the saucepan and let them dissolve in the sauce.
13. Gradually add water or broth to the saucepan, stirring constantly, until the sauce reaches your desired consistency.
14. Serve the cooked cabbage with the sausages and the sauce.

## Cooking time
1-2 hours (cooking time may vary depending on the size of the cabbage and the thickness of the meat ball)
