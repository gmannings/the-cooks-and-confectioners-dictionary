# Roasted Pig

## Description
This recipe is for roasting a whole pig. The pig's liver is minced with blanched bacon, mushrooms, truffles, savory herbs, garlic, capers, and an anchovy. This mixture is then stuffed into the pig's belly along with butter and an onion studded with cloves. The pig is then roasted until the skin is crackling and the meat is cooked through. The sauce is made from the pig's own gravy, the pudding inside the pig's belly, butter, and lemon juice.

## Options and commentary
- Instead of mincing the pig's liver, you can use ground pork or pork sausage.
- If you don't have access to truffles, you can omit them or use truffle oil for flavor.
- The stuffing can be customized with additional herbs and spices according to your taste.
- The sauce can be thickened with a roux or cornstarch slurry if desired.

## Ingredients:
- 1 whole pig (approximately 20-30 kg)
- 500g pork liver (or ground pork/pork sausage)
- 200g blanched bacon, finely chopped
- 200g mushrooms, finely chopped
- 50g truffles, finely chopped (optional)
- 2 tablespoons savory herbs (such as thyme, rosemary, and sage), finely chopped
- 1/2 clove of garlic, minced
- 2 tablespoons capers, drained and chopped
- 1 anchovy fillet, minced
- 100g butter, softened
- 1 onion
- Cloves
- Sallet-oyl (salad oil)
- Salt and pepper to taste
- 1 lemon

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 180째C (350째F).
2. In a large bowl, combine the minced pork liver (or ground pork/pork sausage), blanched bacon, mushrooms, truffles (if using), savory herbs, minced garlic, capers, and minced anchovy. Mix well to combine.
3. Stuff the pig's belly with the mixture, ensuring it is evenly distributed. Add pieces of softened butter and the onion studded with cloves to the stuffing.
4. Sew up the pig's belly to secure the stuffing inside.
5. Place the pig on a roasting spit and secure it tightly.
6. Dip a feather or brush in salad oil and rub the pig's skin all over. This will help the skin to become crispy and prevent it from blistering.
7. Place the pig on a roasting rack in a large roasting pan.
8. Roast the pig in the preheated oven for approximately 4-6 hours, or until the internal temperature reaches 70째C (160째F) and the skin is crispy and golden brown.
9. While the pig is roasting, prepare the sauce. In a saucepan, combine the pig's own gravy (drippings from the roasting pan), the pudding from the pig's belly, a knob of butter, and the juice of one lemon. Heat the sauce gently until the butter is melted and the flavors are combined. Season with salt and pepper to taste.
10. Once the pig is cooked, remove it from the oven and let it rest for 20-30 minutes before carving.
11. Serve the roasted pig with the sauce on the side.
