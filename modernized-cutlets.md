# Modernized Cutlets

## Description
This recipe is for delicious and tender cutlets that are marinated and then fried to perfection. The marinade adds a tangy and flavorful touch to the meat, while the batter creates a crispy coating. These cutlets make a great main course and can be served with a side of vegetables or a salad.

## Ingredients:
- 4 veal cutlets
- 1/4 cup verjuice (or substitute with white wine vinegar)
- Juice of 1 lemon
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 1/2 teaspoon pepper
- 4 cloves
- 2 bay leaves
- 2 sprigs of chives
- 1/2 cup water
- 1/2 cup all-purpose flour
- 1 egg
- 1 tablespoon butter
- Hog's lard (or substitute with vegetable oil)
- Fresh parsley for garnish

## Instructions:
1. In a bowl, combine the verjuice, lemon juice, salt, pepper, cloves, bay leaves, and chives. Mix well to create the marinade.
2. Place the veal cutlets in a shallow dish and pour the marinade over them. Make sure the cutlets are fully coated. Cover the dish and refrigerate for at least three hours to allow the flavors to develop.
3. In a separate bowl, whisk together the water, flour, egg, and butter until well combined. This will create the batter for the cutlets.
4. Heat a generous amount of hog's lard (or vegetable oil) in a frying pan over medium heat.
5. Remove the veal cutlets from the marinade and dip them into the batter, making sure they are fully coated.
6. Carefully place the battered cutlets into the hot lard and fry them for about 3-4 minutes on each side, or until they are golden brown and cooked through.
7. Once cooked, remove the cutlets from the pan and place them on a paper towel-lined plate to drain any excess oil.
8. Garnish the cutlets with fried parsley for added flavor and presentation.
9. Serve the cutlets as the main course, accompanied by your choice of side dishes.
