# The Countess of Rutland's Banbury Cake

## Description
The Countess of Rutland's Banbury Cake is a traditional 18th-century cake made with a rich pastry dough filled with currants, spices, and a hint of rosewater. It is a sweet and aromatic treat that can be enjoyed as a dessert or with a cup of tea.

## Ingredients:
- 500g fine flour
- 225g butter
- 14g nutmegs
- 14g cinnamon
- 14g mace
- 5 eggs (3 whole eggs and 2 egg whites)
- 120ml ale yeast
- 500g currants
- 50g sugar
- A small amount of ambergris (optional)
- A small amount of musk (optional)
- 30ml rosewater

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 180Â°C.
2. In a large mixing bowl, combine the flour, butter, nutmegs, cinnamon, and mace. Mix well until the butter is evenly distributed and the mixture resembles breadcrumbs.
3. In a separate bowl, beat the eggs and strain them into the ale yeast. Add a little warm water and mix well.
4. Pour the egg and yeast mixture into the flour mixture. Stir until well combined.
5. Break the butter into small pieces and add it to the dough. Mix until the butter is evenly distributed.
6. Heat some water until it is scalding hot. Use this water to knead the dough until it forms a smooth and elastic consistency.
7. Cover the dough with a warm cloth and let it rise for 15 minutes.
8. Meanwhile, dry the currants thoroughly and mix them with the sugar. If desired, dissolve a small amount of ambergris and musk in rosewater and add it to the currants for extra flavor.
9. After the dough has risen, divide it into small pieces. Roll out one piece thinly and brush it with rosewater.
10. Layer the rolled dough with the currant mixture, repeating until all the ingredients are used.
11. Close the cake by folding the dough layers together and sealing them well.
12. Prick the top and sides of the cake with a long pin.
13. Place the cake in the preheated oven and bake for approximately 1 hour or until golden brown and cooked through.
14. Once baked, remove the cake from the oven and let it cool before serving.
