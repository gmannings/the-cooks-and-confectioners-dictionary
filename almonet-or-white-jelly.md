# Almonet, or White Jelly

## Description
Almonet, or white jelly, is a delicate and creamy dessert made with almonds and jelly. It has a smooth texture and a subtle almond flavor. This recipe is a modernized version of an 18th-century recipe.

## Ingredients:
- 225g almonds, blanched
- 1 tablespoon orange flower water
- 600ml jelly (such as gelatin-based jelly)
- 120ml white wine
- Juice of 1 lemon

## Instructions:
1. In a food processor or blender, grind the blanched almonds until they form a fine powder.
2. Add the orange flower water to the ground almonds and continue to blend until the mixture becomes a smooth paste. Add a little more orange flower water if needed to prevent the almonds from becoming oily.
3. In a separate bowl, mix the jelly, white wine, and lemon juice together. Make sure the jelly is not too diluted.
4. Pass the almond paste through a fine-mesh sieve several times to remove any lumps or grit.
5. Gradually stir the almond paste into the jelly mixture, stirring continuously to ensure it is well combined.
6. Continue stirring the mixture over low heat until it thickens and the color of the almonds does not settle to the bottom.
7. Pour the mixture into individual glasses or molds.
8. Allow the jelly to cool to room temperature, then refrigerate for at least 2 hours or until set.
9. Serve chilled.
