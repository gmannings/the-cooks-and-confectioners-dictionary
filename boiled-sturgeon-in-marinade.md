# Boiled Sturgeon in Marinade

## Description
This recipe is for boiling sturgeon in a flavorful marinade. The sturgeon is first soaked in a marinade of vinegar, salt, lemon slices, ginger, cloves, and mace. It is then boiled in a mixture of water, salt, white wine, wine vinegar, and the spices from the marinade. The result is a tender and flavorful dish.

## Ingredients:
- 1 rand of sturgeon (approximately 500g)
- 1 cup vinegar
- 1 tablespoon salt
- 1 lemon, sliced
- 1 tablespoon sliced ginger
- 2-3 whole cloves
- 1 teaspoon mace
- 4 cups water
- 1 cup white wine
- 1 cup wine vinegar

## Instructions:
1. Rinse the sturgeon under cold water to remove any blood.
2. In a large bowl, combine the vinegar, salt, lemon slices, ginger, cloves, and mace to make the marinade.
3. Place the sturgeon in the marinade, making sure it is fully submerged. Cover the bowl and refrigerate for at least 2 hours, or overnight for best results.
4. In a large pot, bring the water and salt to a boil.
5. Remove the sturgeon from the marinade and place it in the boiling water.
6. Add the white wine, wine vinegar, and the spices from the marinade to the pot.
