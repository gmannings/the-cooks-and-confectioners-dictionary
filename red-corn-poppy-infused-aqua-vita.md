# Red Corn Poppy Infused Aqua-vita

## Description
This recipe is for making a red corn poppy infused aqua-vita, a type of flavored liquor. The red corn poppies are dried and then soaked in aqua-vita along with various spices and dried fruits. The resulting infusion is a vibrant red color and has a strong flavor of the poppies and spices.

## Ingredients:
- 1/2 bushel (approximately 18 liters) of red corn poppies
- 2 quarts (1.9 liters) of aqua-vita (a strong distilled spirit, such as vodka or grain alcohol)
- 3 nutmegs
- 2 pieces of ginger, sliced
- 1 stick of cinnamon
- 2 blades of mace
- 6 figs
- 1/2 pound (225 grams) of raisins, seedless
- 1 dram (approximately 3.9 grams) of fennel seeds
- 1 dram (approximately 3.9 grams) of anise seeds
- 1 dram (approximately 3.9 grams) of cardamom, crushed
- 1 ounce (28 grams) of sliced liquorice

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to a low temperature.
2. Spread the red corn poppies evenly in a large dish.
3. Cover the dish with another dish to create a seal.
4. Place the dish in the preheated oven and leave it for several hours, checking occasionally, until the poppies are thoroughly dry.
5. In a large container, combine the dried poppies, aqua-vita, nutmegs, ginger, cinnamon, mace, figs, raisins, fennel seeds, anise seeds, cardamom, and liquorice.
6. Stir the mixture well to ensure all the ingredients are evenly distributed.
7. Line the bottom of a broad glass container with a layer of dried poppies.
8. Add a layer of the other ingredients on top of the poppies.
9. Repeat the layering process, alternating between poppies and the other ingredients, until the glass container is full.
10. Pour the aqua-vita mixture into the glass container, ensuring that all the ingredients are fully covered.
11. Close the glass container tightly to create a seal.
12. Allow the mixture to infuse for several weeks, until the aqua-vita turns a deep red color and has a strong aroma of the poppies and spices.
13. To serve, take two or three spoonfuls of the infused aqua-vita at a time.
14. When the infusion is fully used, more aqua-vita can be poured over the remaining ingredients to create a new batch.
