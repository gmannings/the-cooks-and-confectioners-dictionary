# Sage Water

## Description
Sage Water is a traditional herbal preparation made from sage flowers. It is commonly used as a natural remedy for various ailments and can also be used as a flavoring agent in cooking and baking.

## Ingredients:
- Fresh sage flowers
- White wine or water

## Instructions:
1. Take fresh sage flowers and sprinkle them with white wine or water. 
2. Let the sage flowers stand for a while to macerate, allowing the flavors to infuse.
3. After maceration, transfer the sage flowers to a distillation apparatus, such as a still or a water bath.
4. Set up a bain-marie (water bath) by placing the distillation apparatus in a larger pot filled with water.
5. Heat the bain-marie gently, allowing the water to simmer.
6. As the water bath heats up, the sage flowers will release their aromatic compounds, which will condense and collect in a separate container.
7. Collect the distilled liquid, which is the sage water.
8. Store the sage water in a clean, airtight container.

## Cooking time
Approximately 1-2 hours, depending on the distillation apparatus used.
