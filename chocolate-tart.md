# Chocolate Tart

## Description
This recipe is for a rich and creamy chocolate tart. The tart filling is made with a mixture of milk, egg yolks, rice flour, cream, sugar, and grated chocolate. The tart is baked until set and then glazed with powdered sugar using a red hot shovel.

## Options and commentary
- You can use any type of chocolate you prefer, such as dark, milk, or white chocolate.
- If you don't have rice flour, you can substitute it with all-purpose flour.
- The glazing step with the red hot shovel can be skipped if desired.

## Ingredients:
- 250 ml milk
- 10 egg yolks
- 2 tablespoons rice flour (or all-purpose flour)
- Pinch of salt
- 1 liter cream
- Sugar, to taste
- 200 grams grated chocolate
- Powdered sugar, for glazing

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 180Â°C.
2. In a mixing bowl, whisk together the milk, egg yolks, rice flour, and salt until well combined.
3. In a saucepan, heat the cream over medium heat until it starts to simmer. Be careful not to let it boil.
4. Gradually pour the hot cream into the egg mixture, whisking constantly to prevent curdling.
5. Add sugar to the mixture according to your taste preferences. Start with 1/4 cup and adjust as needed.
6. Return the mixture to the saucepan and cook over low heat, stirring constantly, until it thickens and coats the back of a spoon. This should take about 5-7 minutes.
7. Remove the saucepan from heat and stir in the grated chocolate until it is completely melted and well incorporated.
8. Allow the mixture to cool to room temperature.
9. Line a tart pan with pastry dough and pour the chocolate mixture into the tart shell.
10. Bake the tart in the preheated oven for about 30-35 minutes, or until the filling is set and the crust is golden brown.
11. Remove the tart from the oven and let it cool completely.
12. Once the tart is cooled, sprinkle powdered sugar over the top.
13. Heat a metal shovel or spatula over an open flame until it is red hot.
14. Carefully press the hot shovel onto the powdered sugar to create a glaze effect. Be cautious not to burn yourself.
15. Allow the glaze to cool and set before serving.
