# Keep Flowers all the Year

## Description
This recipe provides a method for preserving flowers so that they can be enjoyed throughout the year. By treating the flowers with a sticky solution made from gum arabic and rosewater, they can be preserved and displayed without wilting or losing their color.

## Ingredients:
- Gum arabic
- Rosewater
- Assorted flowers

## Instructions:
1. In a small bowl, combine gum arabic and rosewater. The ratio should be approximately 1 part gum arabic to 2 parts rosewater. Stir well to dissolve the gum arabic and create a sticky solution.
2. Select the flowers you wish to preserve. Choose flowers that are in good condition and have not yet fully bloomed.
3. Dip each flower into the gum arabic and rosewater solution, making sure to coat the entire flower. Allow any excess solution to drip off.
4. Place the coated flowers in a sieve to dry. Make sure the flowers are spread out and not touching each other to prevent them from sticking together.
5. Set the sieve in a sunny location, such as a windowsill or outdoor area. The sunlight will help to speed up the drying process.
6. Leave the flowers to dry for several days, or until they are completely dry and no longer sticky to the touch.
7. Once the flowers are dry, carefully remove them from the sieve and store them in a dry, airtight container. They can now be kept and displayed throughout the year.

## Cooking time
Several days for drying the flowers.
