# Co-broiled Gurnets with Anchovy Sauce

## Description
This recipe is for co-broiled gurnets, a type of fish, served with a flavorful anchovy sauce. The gurnets are seasoned with melted butter and salt, then broiled until cooked through. The anchovy sauce is made with fresh butter, flour, leek, salt, pepper, nutmeg, vinegar, water, and anchovies. The sauce is cooked on the stovetop until thickened and then poured over the cooked fish before serving.

## Ingredients:
- 2 gurnets (substitute with any firm white fish fillets)
- 2 tablespoons melted butter
- Salt, to taste
- 2 tablespoons fresh butter
- 1 tablespoon flour
- 1 leek, sliced
- Salt, to taste
- Pepper, to taste
- Nutmeg, to taste
- 1 tablespoon vinegar
- 1/4 cup water
- 2 anchovies, minced

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the broiler in your oven.
2. Cut off the heads of the gurnets and clean them thoroughly.
3. Dip the gurnets in the melted butter and sprinkle with salt.
4. Place the gurnets on a broiler pan and broil them under a medium-high heat until cooked through, about 8-10 minutes per side. The fish should be opaque and flake easily with a fork.
5. While the gurnets are broiling, prepare the anchovy sauce.
6. In a saucepan, melt the fresh butter over medium heat.
7. Add the flour to the melted butter and stir until well combined.
8. Add the sliced leek to the saucepan and cook until softened.
9. Season the mixture with salt, pepper, and nutmeg to taste.
10. In a small bowl, mix together the vinegar and water.
11. Gradually add the vinegar-water mixture to the saucepan, stirring constantly.
12. Add the minced anchovies to the saucepan and continue to cook, stirring constantly, until the sauce thickens.
13. Once the gurnets are cooked, remove them from the broiler and transfer them to a serving dish.
14. Pour the anchovy sauce over the gurnets.
15. Serve the co-broiled gurnets with anchovy sauce immediately.
