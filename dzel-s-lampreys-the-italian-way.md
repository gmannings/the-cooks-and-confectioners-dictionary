# Dzel's Lampreys the Italian Way

## Description
This recipe is a modernized version of an 18th-century dish called "Dzel's Lampreys the Italian Way." Lampreys are seasoned with a blend of spices, then baked in a pastry crust with dried fruits. The dish is then topped with a sauce made from sweet herbs, almonds, grapes, raisins, sugar, and verjuice. It is served hot with a glaze made from white wine, the blood of the lampreys, orange juice, and cinnamon.

## Options and commentary
- Lampreys: Lampreys are not commonly available in modern times. A suitable alternative would be to use eel fillets or another firm-fleshed fish.
- Verjuice: Verjuice is a sour juice made from unripe grapes. If you can't find verjuice, you can substitute it with a combination of lemon juice and white wine vinegar.
- Pastry: You can use store-bought pie crust or make your own from scratch.
- Sweet herbs: Use a combination of fresh herbs like parsley, basil, and mint.
- Almonds: Use ground almonds or almond meal.
- White wine: Choose a dry white wine for the glaze.

## Ingredients:
- 500g lampreys or eel fillets
- Salt
- Pepper
- Ginger
- Cinnamon
- Nutmeg
- 1 sheet of pie crust or homemade pastry
- 50g raisins
- 50g currants
- 50g dried prunes
- 50g dates
- 50g cherries
- 50g butter
- 2 tablespoons chopped fresh sweet herbs (parsley, basil, mint)
- 50g ground almonds
- 100g grapes
- 50g sugar
- 2 tablespoons verjuice (or 1 tablespoon lemon juice + 1 tablespoon white wine vinegar)
- Juice of 2 oranges
- 1 teaspoon cinnamon
- White wine, for glazing

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F).
2. If using lampreys, skin them and remove any bones. If using eel fillets, ensure they are boneless.
3. Season the lampreys or eel fillets with salt, pepper, ginger, cinnamon, and nutmeg. Set aside.
4. Roll out the pie crust or homemade pastry and line a pie dish with it.
5. Place the seasoned lampreys or eel fillets in the pie dish. If using lampreys, you can either leave them whole or cut them into pieces.
6. Sprinkle the raisins, currants, dried prunes, dates, and cherries over the lampreys or eel fillets.
7. Dot the top with butter.
8. Cover the pie with another layer of pie crust or pastry, sealing the edges.
9. Bake the pie in the preheated oven for about 45 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown and the fish is cooked through.
10. While the pie is baking, prepare the sauce. In a saucepan, combine the chopped sweet herbs, ground almonds, grapes, sugar, and verjuice (or lemon juice + white wine vinegar).
11. Bring the sauce to a simmer over medium heat and cook for about 10 minutes, until the grapes have softened and the sauce has thickened slightly.
12. Remove the pie from the oven and let it cool for a few minutes.
13. Pour the prepared sauce over the pie, straining out any solids.
14. Return the pie to the oven for another 5 minutes to allow the sauce to set.
15. In a small saucepan, combine the white wine, blood of the lampreys (or omit if using eel fillets), orange juice, and cinnamon. Heat gently until warmed through.
16. Remove the pie from the oven and glaze the top with the white wine mixture.
17. Serve the pie hot, accompanied by the glaze and additional white wine if desired.
