# Fried Smelts

## Description
Fried smelts are a classic seafood dish that is crispy on the outside and tender on the inside. The smelts are marinated in a mixture of vinegar, salt, pepper, chives, and bay leaves, then coated in flour and fried until golden brown. They are served hot with fried parsley for added flavor and garnish.

## Ingredients:
- 500 grams smelts
- 100 ml vinegar
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 1/2 teaspoon black pepper
- 2 tablespoons chopped chives
- 2 bay leaves
- Flour, for dredging
- Vegetable oil, for frying
- Fresh parsley, for garnish

## Instructions:
1. In a bowl, combine the vinegar, salt, pepper, chives, and bay leaves to make the marinade.
2. Place the smelts in the marinade and let them soak for at least 30 minutes.
3. Remove the smelts from the marinade and pat them dry with a kitchen towel.
4. Dredge the smelts in flour, shaking off any excess.
5. Heat vegetable oil in a frying pan over medium-high heat.
6. Fry the smelts in batches until they are golden brown and crispy on both sides. This should take about 2-3 minutes per side.
7. Remove the fried smelts from the pan and place them on a paper towel-lined plate to drain any excess oil.
8. In the same pan, fry the parsley until it is crispy.
9. Serve the fried smelts hot, garnished with the fried parsley.
