# Seed Cake

## Description
Seed Cake is a traditional British cake that is flavored with caraway seeds. It has a dense and moist texture, with a slightly sweet and aromatic taste. This recipe is a modernized version of an 18th-century recipe, using approximate metric measurements and modern ingredients.

## Options and commentary
- You can substitute caraway seeds with other seeds such as poppy seeds or sesame seeds if desired.
- If you don't have ale yeast, you can use active dry yeast or instant yeast as a substitute.
- Sack refers to a type of fortified wine, similar to sherry. You can use sherry or another sweet white wine as a substitute.

## Ingredients:
- 680g all-purpose flour
- 450g unsalted butter, softened
- 14 large eggs
- 6 tablespoons rose water
- 120ml sweet white wine (such as sherry)
- 18 tablespoons ale yeast (or substitute with active dry yeast or instant yeast)
- 100g granulated sugar
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 225g caraway seeds (or substitute with poppy seeds or sesame seeds)

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F). Grease and flour a cake pan or line it with parchment paper.
2. In a large mixing bowl, combine 450g of flour and softened butter. Use your hands or a pastry cutter to work the butter into the flour until it resembles coarse crumbs.
3. In a separate bowl, whisk together the eggs, rose water, sweet white wine, and ale yeast.
4. Strain the liquid mixture into the remaining 230g of flour. Mix well until it forms a batter-like consistency.
5. Pour the batter into the bowl with the butter and flour mixture. Add the sugar and salt. Use your hands to mix everything together until well combined.
6. Stir in the caraway seeds until evenly distributed throughout the batter.
7. Transfer the batter to the prepared cake pan and smooth the top with a spatula.
8. Bake in the preheated oven for approximately 1 hour, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.
9. Remove the cake from the oven and let it cool in the pan for 10 minutes. Then, transfer it to a wire rack to cool completely before serving.
