# Scurvy-grass Wine

## Description
Scurvy-grass wine is a refreshing and tangy beverage made from fresh scurvy-grass and Rhenish wine. It was commonly consumed in the 18th century as a remedy for scurvy, a disease caused by vitamin C deficiency. This modernized recipe provides a simple method to make scurvy-grass wine at home.

## Ingredients:
- 6 handfuls of fresh scurvy-grass
- 3 liters of Rhenish wine (or any dry white wine)

## Instructions:
1. Take 6 handfuls of fresh scurvy-grass and pound it well in a mortar to release its flavors.
2. Place the pounded scurvy-grass in a large container or jar.
3. Pour 3 liters of Rhenish wine (or any dry white wine) over the scurvy-grass.
4. Cover the container or jar and place it in a cool place for three to four days. This will allow the scurvy-grass to infuse its flavors into the wine.
5. After three to four days, strain the scurvy-grass wine to remove any solids.
6. Allow the wine to settle for a while, so any sediment can settle at the bottom.
7. Carefully pour off the scurvy-grass wine from the container, leaving behind any sediment or dregs.

## Cooking time
3-4 days (infusing time)
