# Boiled Trout

## Description
This recipe is for boiled trout, a simple and classic dish that highlights the natural flavors of the fish. The trout is boiled in a flavorful broth and served with a butter sauce, horseradish, and ginger. It is garnished with slices of lemon for a refreshing touch.

## Ingredients:
- 2 trout
- Stale beer (enough to cover the fish)
- White wine vinegar (enough to cover the fish)
- Water (enough to cover the fish)
- Salt
- 1 bunch of winter savory
- Thyme
- Rosemary
- 1 handful of horseradish root, sliced
- Butter
- Horseradish, shaved
- Ginger, beaten
- Lemon slices

## Instructions:
1. Wash the trout and dry them with a cloth.
2. Open the trout and remove the guts, making sure to take out all the blood.
3. Make three shallow cuts on one side of each trout, going all the way to the bone.
4. In a fish kettle or stew-pan, combine the stale beer, white wine vinegar, and water. Use enough liquid to cover the fish.
5. Add a good amount of salt, the bunch of winter savory, thyme, rosemary, and the sliced horseradish root to the pan.
6. Place the pan over a brisk wood fire and bring the liquid to a boil.
7. Once the liquid is boiling, carefully add the trout one by one to the pan. This will prevent them from cooling down the boiling liquid.
8. While the fish is boiling, make a sauce by beating butter with some of the fish broth.
9. After the trout has boiled for a few minutes, remove them from the pan and drain them.
10. Place the trout on a serving dish and pour the butter sauce over them.
11. Generously sprinkle the trout with shaved horseradish and beaten ginger.
12. Garnish the dish with slices of lemon.
13. Serve the boiled trout immediately.
