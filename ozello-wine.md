# Ozello Wine

## Description
Ozello Wine is a fruity and refreshing wine made from Morello cherries. The cherries are crushed to release their juice, which is then mixed with white wine. The mixture is left to ferment for a month or more, resulting in a delicious homemade wine.

## Ingredients:
- 11 kg Morello cherries
- 34-38 liters white wine (dry or semi-dry)
- Optional: spices such as cinnamon or cloves

## Instructions:
1. Remove the stalks from the Morello cherries and crush them, ensuring that the stones are broken.
2. Press out the juice from the crushed cherries and set it aside.
3. In a large container or cask, pour in 9-10 gallons (34-38 liters) of white wine.
4. Place the cherry skins and stones in a bag and hang it in the cask, making sure it does not touch the bottom.
5. If desired, add spices such as cinnamon or cloves to the cask.
6. Cover the cask and let it stand for a month or more, allowing the mixture to ferment.
7. After the fermentation period, taste the wine and adjust the sweetness or acidity if necessary.
8. Strain the wine to remove any solids or sediment.
9. Bottle the wine and store it in a cool, dark place for further aging, if desired.

## Options and commentary:
- Morello cherries can be substituted with other tart cherries if desired.
- The amount of white wine can be adjusted based on personal preference and the desired strength of the wine.
- Adding spices such as cinnamon or cloves can enhance the flavor of the wine, but it is not necessary.
- The wine can be consumed after the fermentation period, but aging it for a longer period will result in a smoother and more complex flavor.

## Cooking time
1 month or more for fermentation, additional aging time if desired.
