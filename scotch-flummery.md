# Scotch Flummery

## Description
Scotch Flummery is a traditional Scottish dessert made with milk, eggs, sugar, and spices. It has a creamy and custard-like texture with a hint of nutmeg. This recipe is a modernized version of an 18th-century recipe.

## Ingredients:
- 750 ml of whole milk
- 100 ml of heavy cream
- 9 egg yolks
- 50 ml of milk or rose water
- 100 g of sugar
- 1/2 teaspoon of ground nutmeg
- 50 g of currants
- 50 ml of sweet sherry or white wine

## Instructions:
1. In a saucepan, heat the milk and cream over medium heat until it reaches a gentle simmer. Remove from heat and set aside.
2. In a mixing bowl, whisk together the egg yolks and 50 ml of milk or rose water until well combined.
3. Gradually add the sugar to the egg yolk mixture, whisking continuously until the sugar is dissolved.
4. Slowly pour the warm milk and cream mixture into the egg yolk mixture, whisking constantly to prevent curdling.
5. Return the mixture to the saucepan and place it over low heat. Cook the mixture, stirring constantly, until it thickens and coats the back of a spoon. This should take about 10-15 minutes. Do not let it boil.
6. Remove the saucepan from heat and stir in the ground nutmeg.
7. Butter a dish and pour the flummery mixture into it.
8. In a separate small bowl, combine the currants and sweet sherry or white wine. Let them soak for a few minutes.
9. Sprinkle the plumped currants over the flummery mixture in the dish.
10. Cover the dish with a lid or plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 2 hours, or until set.
11. Serve the Scotch Flummery chilled.
