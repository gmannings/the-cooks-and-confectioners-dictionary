# Fat Broth

## Description
Fat Broth is a rich and flavorful broth made from beef and other meats. It is traditionally used as a base for various dishes, including potages and soups. The broth is made in two steps, with the first step producing a lighter broth that is used for white potages and farced meats, and the second step producing a darker broth that is used for brown potages and dishes with root vegetables.

## Ingredients:
- 1 buttock and leg of beef
- Other meats (such as capons, young turkeys, veal, etc.)
- Water

## Instructions:
1. In a large pot, add the buttock and leg of beef and other meats.
2. Fill the pot with enough water to cover the meats.
3. Bring the water to a boil and let it simmer for a few hours until the meats are cooked through and tender.
4. Remove the meats from the pot and set them aside.
5. Strain the broth through a linen cloth to remove any impurities.
6. Reserve the strained broth for later use.

## Cooking time
Several hours

## Options and commentary
- For a modern approach, you can use beef bones, such as beef shanks or oxtail, instead of a whole buttock and leg of beef. This will still provide a rich and flavorful broth.
- You can also add additional meats, such as chicken or pork, to enhance the flavor of the broth.
- If desired, you can add vegetables and herbs, such as onions, carrots, celery, and bay leaves, to the pot for added flavor.
- The first batch of broth, which is lighter in color, can be used for dishes like white potages and farced meats. The second batch, which is darker, can be used for dishes with root vegetables and brown potages.
