# Cullis of Partridges for Brown Soups and Sauces

## Description
This recipe is for a rich and flavorful brown soup or sauce made with partridges, veal, ham, vegetables, and various herbs and spices. The dish is slow-cooked to develop deep flavors and then strained for a smooth and velvety texture.

## Ingredients:
- 2 partridges, roasted and pounded
- 1 piece of ham
- 500g filet of veal, thinly sliced
- 2 carrots, sliced
- 1 onion, sliced
- 2 tablespoons flour
- 500ml gravy
- 500ml broth
- 4-5 cloves
- Fresh basil
- Fresh parsley
- 1 leek, whole
- Truffles (optional)
- Mushrooms (optional)
- A few crusts of bread

## Instructions:
1. In a large stewpan, arrange the sliced ham and veal on the bottom to create a garnish.
2. Add the sliced carrots and onions to the stewpan.
3. Place the stewpan over medium heat and allow the vegetables to sweat. Stir occasionally to prevent sticking.
4. Once the vegetables start to stick, sprinkle them with flour and continue to cook, stirring, for a few minutes.
5. Pour in the gravy and broth in equal quantities to moisten the vegetables.
6. Season the mixture with cloves, fresh basil, fresh parsley, and the whole leek.
7. If using, add truffles and mushrooms to the stewpan.
8. Add a few crusts of bread to the mixture.
9. Reduce the heat to low and let the ingredients simmer together for three-quarters of an hour.
10. After three-quarters of an hour, add the pounded partridges to the stewpan and mix well.
11. Continue to simmer the mixture for another quarter of an hour.
12. Strain the mixture through a fine-mesh sieve or cheesecloth to remove any solids.
13. The strained cullis is now ready to be used in soups or sauces.
