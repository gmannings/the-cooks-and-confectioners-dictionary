# Boiled Leg of Veal with Stuffing and Green Broth

## Description
This recipe is for a boiled leg of veal that is stuffed with a mixture of beef, suet, and herbs. The veal is then boiled in water and salt. After boiling, the veal is served with a sauce made from the cooking liquid, veal, capers, currants, bacon, cloves, artichoke hearts, butter, marrow, mace, and pieces of pears. The dish is finished with a green broth made from sorrel, sage, sweet marjoram, thyme, and parsley, which is added to the cooking liquid along with barberries or gooseberries, beaten butter, and lemon.

## Options and commentary
- Instead of stuffing the veal with beef, you can use ground beef or pork as a filling.
- You can use other herbs such as rosemary or basil in the stuffing.
- If you don't have capers, you can use chopped pickles or olives as a substitute.
- Instead of artichoke hearts, you can use cooked asparagus or green beans.
- Barberries or gooseberries may be difficult to find, so you can omit them or use cranberries as a substitute.
- The green broth adds color and flavor to the dish, but it is optional. You can skip this step if you prefer.

## Ingredients:
- 1 leg of veal
- 200g beef, ground beef, or ground pork
- 50g suet, finely chopped
- 2 tablespoons fresh herbs (such as parsley, thyme, sage, and marjoram), finely chopped
- Salt and nutmeg to taste
- Water
- Salt
- 2 tablespoons capers
- 2 tablespoons currants
- 1 piece of interlarded bacon
- 2-3 whole cloves
- 4-6 artichoke hearts, boiled
- 2 tablespoons butter
- 2 tablespoons marrow, boiled
- 1 teaspoon mace
- 2-3 pieces of pears, peeled and diced
- 1 cup sorrel, finely chopped
- 1 cup sage, finely chopped
- 1 cup sweet marjoram, finely chopped
- 1 cup thyme, finely chopped
- 1 cup parsley, finely chopped
- 1 cup barberries or gooseberries (or cranberries), optional
- 2 tablespoons beaten butter
- Juice of 1 lemon

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F).
2. In a bowl, mix together the ground beef or pork, suet, fresh herbs, salt, and nutmeg to make the stuffing.
3. Make a slit in the leg of veal and stuff it with the prepared stuffing mixture.
4. Place the stuffed veal in a large pot and add enough water to cover it. Season the water with salt.
5. Bring the water to a boil over high heat, then reduce the heat to low and simmer the veal for about 1 hour per kilogram (30 minutes per pound), or until it is cooked through and tender.
6. While the veal is boiling, prepare the sauce. In a separate pot, combine some of the veal cooking liquid, veal (removed from the pot), capers, currants, interlarded bacon, cloves, boiled artichoke hearts, butter, boiled marrow, mace, and diced pears. Cook over medium heat until the sauce thickens slightly and the flavors meld together, about 15-20 minutes.
7. In another pot, prepare the green broth. Combine the chopped sorrel, sage, sweet marjoram, thyme, and parsley. Use the back of a ladle to bruise and crush the herbs to release their flavors. Add this mixture to the veal cooking liquid and bring it to a simmer. Let it cook for a few minutes to infuse the broth with the herb flavors.
8. If using, add the barberries or gooseberries (or cranberries) to the green broth and cook for an additional 5 minutes.
9. Remove the veal from the pot and let it rest for a few minutes before slicing.
10. Serve the sliced veal with the sauce and green broth. Drizzle with beaten butter and lemon juice.

## Cooking time
- Boiling the veal: approximately 1 hour per kilogram (30 minutes per pound)
- Cooking the sauce: 15-20 minutes
- Cooking the green broth: 5-10 minutes
