# Mint Water

## Description
Mint water is a refreshing and aromatic beverage made from steeping mint leaves in alcohol and then distilling the mixture. It was a popular drink in the 18th century and can be enjoyed on its own or used as an ingredient in cocktails or other recipes.

## Ingredients:
- A good quantity of fresh mint leaves
- Penny-royal leaves (optional)
- Balm leaves (optional)
- 1 bottle of Canary wine (or any other sweet white wine)
- Sugar

## Instructions:
1. In a large container, combine the mint leaves, penny-royal leaves (if using), and balm leaves (if using).
2. Pour the bottle of Canary wine over the leaves, making sure they are fully submerged.
3. Cover the container tightly and let it steep for twenty-four hours, stirring occasionally.
4. After twenty-four hours, strain the mixture through a fine-mesh sieve or cheesecloth to remove the leaves.
5. Transfer the strained liquid into a distillation apparatus, such as an alembic.
6. Apply heat to the alembic and distill the liquid with a quick fire. Collect the distilled liquid in a receiver.
7. While the liquid is still warm, sweeten it to taste with sugar. Stir until the sugar is fully dissolved.
8. Allow the mint water to cool completely before transferring it to a clean bottle or container for storage.

## Cooking time
Approximately 24 hours for steeping + distillation time (varies depending on the equipment used)
