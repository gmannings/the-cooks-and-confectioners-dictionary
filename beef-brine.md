# Beef Brine

## Description
This recipe is for brining and preserving beef. The beef is soaked in a brine solution for several days, then seasoned with various spices and herbs before being baked and hung to dry. The end result is a flavorful and tender beef that can be sliced and enjoyed as a cold cut.

## Ingredients:
- 1 brisket or beef roast (approximately 2-3 kg)
- 3 liters of water
- 6 handfuls of white salt
- 3 handfuls of bay salt
- 1 ounce of saltpetre
- 2 handfuls of white salt (for seasoning)
- 1 ounce of pepper
- 20 cloves
- 1 ounce of dried sweet marjoram, powdered
- 2 ounces of bay berries
- 7 nutmegs, shredded
- 1 ounce of mace
- 2 quarts of claret (red wine)
- 1 pint of water
- 1 pint of vinegar

## Instructions:
1. In a large pot, combine the water, 6 handfuls of white salt, bay salt, and saltpetre. Stir until the salts are dissolved.
2. Place the beef brisket or roast in the brine solution, making sure it is fully submerged. If necessary, weigh it down with a plate or heavy object. Cover the pot and refrigerate for 9 days, turning the beef occasionally.
3. After 9 days, remove the beef from the brine and pat it dry with paper towels.
4. In a mortar and pestle, crush 2 handfuls of white salt until it becomes fine. Add the pepper, cloves, dried sweet marjoram, bay berries, nutmegs, and mace. Mix well.
5. Rub the salt and spice mixture all over the beef, making sure to coat it evenly.
6. Roll the beef tightly and tie it securely with kitchen twine. Wrap it tightly in a clean cloth.
7. Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F).
8. In a deep baking pan, combine the claret, water, and vinegar. Place the wrapped beef in the pan.
9. Cover the pan with a lid made of dough, sealing it tightly.
10. Place the pan in the preheated oven and bake for several hours, or until the beef is cooked through and tender. This may take around 4-5 hours, depending on the size of the beef.
11. After baking, remove the beef from the pan and discard the dough lid. Allow the beef to cool slightly.
12. Re-tie the beef with fresh kitchen twine, making sure it is tightly secured.
13. Hang the beef in a cool, dry place for several days, or until it is completely cold and firm.
14. Once the beef is fully cured, it can be sliced thinly and enjoyed as a cold cut.

## Cooking time
