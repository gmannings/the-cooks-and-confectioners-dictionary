# Stewed Eggs with Partridge

## Description
This recipe is for a dish called "Another May" from an 18th-century cookbook. It consists of minced partridge meat and eggs stewed in a flavorful gravy. The dish is seasoned with cloves, nutmeg, and mace, and finished with a hint of orange juice. It is garnished with whole onions for added flavor and presentation.

## Options and commentary
- Instead of partridge, you can use the flesh of any other fowl such as chicken or turkey.
- If you don't have mutton gravy, you can use chicken or vegetable broth as a substitute.
- Anchovies add a savory depth to the dish, but if you prefer a vegetarian version, you can omit them or use a vegetarian Worcestershire sauce instead.
- The whole onions can be served as a garnish or cooked with the dish for added flavor. If you prefer a milder onion flavor, you can use shallots instead.

## Ingredients:
- 6 eggs
- Flesh of 2 partridges (or other fowl), minced
- 1 ladleful of mutton gravy (or chicken/vegetable broth)
- 2 anchovies, dissolved in the gravy (optional)
- 1/4 teaspoon cloves, beaten
- 1/4 teaspoon nutmeg, grated
- 1/4 teaspoon mace
- Juice of 1 orange
- Whole onions, for garnish

## Instructions:
1. In a silver dish or a deep skillet, combine the minced partridge meat, mutton gravy (or broth), and dissolved anchovies (if using).
2. Season the mixture with beaten cloves, grated nutmeg, and mace.
3. Place the dish over low heat on a stove or chafing dish and let it stew for about 10 minutes, stirring occasionally.
4. Meanwhile, crack the eggs into a separate bowl, discarding most of the whites. 
5. Using the end of an eggshell, create small wells in the meat mixture to hold the eggs.
6. Carefully slide each egg into its designated well in the dish, making sure they are evenly spaced.
7. Continue stewing the dish until the eggs are cooked to your desired doneness. This will take about 5-7 minutes for soft-set eggs.
8. While the eggs are cooking, grate in some additional nutmeg and squeeze in the juice of an orange for added flavor.
9. Once the eggs are cooked, garnish the dish with whole onions.
10. Serve the stewed eggs with partridge hot.
