# Farced Mushrooms

## Description
Farced mushrooms are mushrooms stuffed with a flavorful mixture of meat, bread, and seasonings. They are then baked until cooked through and served with beef gravy.

## Options and commentary
- You can use either veal or chicken breast for the meat in the farce.
- Instead of beef marrow, you can use butter or another type of fat.
- If you prefer a vegetarian version, you can omit the meat and use a mixture of breadcrumbs, cheese, and herbs for the stuffing.
- For a fast-day option, use fish instead of meat in the farce and add mushroom juice for extra flavor.

## Ingredients:
- 12 large mushrooms
- 200g veal or chicken breast, minced
- 50g bacon, finely chopped
- 50g beef marrow or butter, melted
- 1 French roll, crumb soaked in 50ml cream
- 2 egg yolks
- Salt and pepper to taste
- Nutmeg to taste
- Beef gravy, for serving

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F).
2. Clean the mushrooms by wiping them with a damp cloth. Remove the stalks and set them aside.
3. In a mixing bowl, combine the minced veal or chicken breast, chopped bacon, melted beef marrow or butter, soaked French roll crumbs, egg yolks, salt, pepper, and nutmeg. Mix well until all the ingredients are evenly incorporated.
4. Take each mushroom cap and stuff it with the farce mixture, filling it generously. Place the stuffed mushrooms in a tart pan or baking dish.
5. Once all the mushrooms are stuffed and arranged in the pan, place it in the preheated oven.
6. Bake the mushrooms for approximately 20-25 minutes, or until the farce is cooked through and the mushrooms are tender.
7. While the mushrooms are baking, prepare the beef gravy according to your preferred recipe.
8. Once the mushrooms are done, remove them from the oven and transfer them to a serving dish.
9. Pour the beef gravy over the mushrooms, ensuring they are well coated.
10. Serve the farced mushrooms hot as an appetizer or side dish.
