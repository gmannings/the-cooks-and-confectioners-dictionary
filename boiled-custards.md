# Boiled Custards

## Description
Boiled custards are a classic dessert made with a creamy custard base. This recipe from the 18th century calls for boiling cream with spices, then combining it with eggs, rose water, and sugar before baking. The result is a rich and flavorful custard with a delicate texture.

## Options and commentary
- You can adjust the amount of sugar according to your taste preference.
- Feel free to experiment with different spices such as cinnamon or nutmeg for added flavor.
- If you don't have rose water, you can substitute it with vanilla extract or any other flavored extract of your choice.

## Ingredients:
- 1 quart (950 ml) of cream
- Whole spices (such as cloves, cinnamon, or nutmeg)
- 10 egg yolks
- 5 egg whites
- 1/4 cup (60 ml) of rose water
- Sugar, to taste

## Instructions:
1. In a saucepan, combine the cream and whole spices. Heat over medium heat until the cream starts to simmer. Remove from heat and let the spices infuse for about 10 minutes.
2. In a mixing bowl, whisk together the egg yolks, egg whites, and a little bit of cream.
3. Gradually pour the infused cream into the egg mixture while whisking continuously. This will temper the eggs and prevent them from curdling.
4. Stir in the rose water and sweeten the custard with sugar to your liking. Keep in mind that the custard will become slightly less sweet as it cools.
5. Preheat your oven to 325°F (160°C).
6. Strain the custard mixture through a fine-mesh sieve to remove any lumps or spices.
7. Pour the custard into individual ramekins or a baking dish.
8. Place the ramekins or baking dish in a larger baking pan. Fill the larger pan with enough hot water to reach halfway up the sides of the ramekins or baking dish. This water bath will help the custards cook evenly.
9. Carefully transfer the pan to the preheated oven and bake for about 30-40 minutes, or until the custards are set around the edges but still slightly jiggly in the center.
10. Remove the custards from the water bath and let them cool to room temperature. Then refrigerate for at least 2 hours, or until fully chilled.
11. Serve the boiled custards chilled, either on their own or with a sprinkle of ground cinnamon or nutmeg on top.

## Cooking time
Approximately 30-40 minutes baking time, plus at least 2 hours chilling time.
