# Eels with Brown Sauce

## Description
This recipe is for a classic dish of eels cooked in a rich brown sauce. The eels are cut into pieces and cooked with a combination of burnt butter, herbs, spices, capers, and a touch of white wine and verjuice. The dish is then stewed until the flavors meld together, and it is served with a garnish of lemon.

## Ingredients:
- 500g eels
- 50g butter
- 1 tablespoon chopped fresh herbs (such as parsley and chives)
- Salt and pepper to taste
- 1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg
- 1/4 teaspoon ground cloves
- 1 tablespoon capers
- 100ml white wine
- 1 tablespoon verjuice (or substitute with lemon juice)
- 1 tablespoon flour
- Lemon slices for garnish

## Instructions:
1. Clean and prepare the eels by removing the skin and cutting them into pieces.
2. In a stewpan, melt the butter over medium heat until it turns brown and develops a nutty aroma. Be careful not to burn it.
3. Add the chopped herbs, salt, pepper, nutmeg, cloves, and capers to the stewpan. Stir well to combine.
4. Add the eel pieces to the stewpan and coat them with the butter and herb mixture.
5. Pour in the white wine and verjuice (or lemon juice) and stir gently.
6. Sprinkle the flour over the eels and stir again to ensure everything is well coated.
7. Cover the stewpan and simmer over low heat for about 30-40 minutes, or until the eels are cooked through and tender.
8. Stir occasionally during cooking to prevent sticking and to ensure the flavors are evenly distributed.
9. Once the eels are cooked, transfer them to a serving dish or earthen pan.
10. Garnish with lemon slices and serve hot.
