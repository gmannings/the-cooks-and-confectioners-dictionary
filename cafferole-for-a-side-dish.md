# Cafferole for a Side-dish

## Description
This recipe is for a Cafferole, which is a dish made by hollowing out a loaf of bread and filling it with a savory mixture of roasted meat and gravy. The loaf is then baked and served as a side dish. In this recipe, the loaf is filled with a hash made from roasted chickens or other roast meat, and garnished with a ragout of veal sweetbreads, truffles, and artichoke bottoms.

## Ingredients:
- 1 large loaf of bread
- Eggs, for washing the bread
- Roasted chickens, fat pullets, or other roast meat
- Good gravy
- Crusts of bread
- Bards or thin slices of bacon
- Ragout of veal sweetbreads, truffles, and artichoke bottoms
- Small asparagus tops, for garnish

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 180Â°C.
2. Take the large loaf of bread and chip it on the under side, but not the upper side.
3. Wash the loaf over with beaten eggs.
4. Toast the loaf at the fire on the crummy side until golden brown.
5. Make a hole at the bottom of the loaf and take out the crumb.
6. Mince the roasted chickens, fat pullets, or other roast meat well.
7. Stew the minced meat with good gravy until cooked through.
8. Once the meat is cooked, put it into the hollowed-out loaf using a spoon.
9. Add some crusts of bread to the loaf, alternating with layers of the meat mixture, until the loaf is filled.
10. Take a stew-pan about the size of your loaf and line it with bards or thin slices of bacon.
11. Place the loaf, bottom side down, into the stew-pan.
12. Let the loaf soak in the good gravy, but do not press it down.
13. Carefully turn the loaf into a dish, bottom side up, to avoid breaking it.
14. Remove the bacon bards and drain off any excess fat.
15. Pour on a ragout of veal sweetbreads, truffles, and artichoke bottoms.
16. Garnish with small asparagus tops.
17. Serve the cafferole as a side dish.
