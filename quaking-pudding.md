# Quaking Pudding

## Description
Quaking Pudding is a creamy and fragrant dessert made with almonds, cream, eggs, and flavored with rose-water and spices. It has a smooth and quivering texture, hence the name "quaking." This recipe is a modernized version of an 18th-century recipe.

## Ingredients:
- 250g blanched almonds
- 1 liter sweet cream
- 2-3 blades of mace
- 100g fine sugar
- 1 teaspoon rose-water
- 5 egg whites
- 1 teaspoon powdered cinnamon
- 2-3 tablespoons all-purpose flour
- Butter, for serving
- Additional sugar and rose-water, for serving

## Instructions:
1. In a blender or food processor, finely grind the blanched almonds until they form a smooth paste.
2. In a large saucepan, heat the sweet cream over medium heat until it starts to simmer. Add the ground almonds to the cream and stir well.
3. Add the mace blades to the cream and almond mixture. Let it simmer gently for about 10 minutes, stirring occasionally.
4. After 10 minutes, remove the saucepan from heat and strain the mixture through a fine-mesh sieve or cheesecloth to remove any almond solids. Discard the solids.
5. Return the strained mixture to the saucepan and place it back on the stove over low heat.
6. Add the fine sugar and rose-water to the saucepan and stir until the sugar has dissolved completely.
7. In a separate bowl, beat the egg whites until they form stiff peaks.
8. Add the powdered cinnamon and flour to the beaten egg whites and gently fold them in until well combined.
9. Take a small amount of the strained almond mixture from the saucepan and add it to the egg white mixture. Stir well to temper the eggs.
10. Gradually add the tempered egg white mixture back into the saucepan with the remaining almond mixture, stirring continuously.
11. Cook the mixture over low heat, stirring constantly, until it thickens to a custard-like consistency. This should take about 10-15 minutes.
12. Once the mixture has thickened, remove the saucepan from heat and let it cool slightly.
13. Transfer the quaking pudding to individual serving dishes or a large serving bowl.
14. Serve the quaking pudding warm or chilled, topped with a pat of butter and a sprinkle of sugar. Drizzle with additional rose-water for extra flavor.
