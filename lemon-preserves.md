# Lemon Preserves

## Description
This recipe is for making lemon preserves, a sweet and tangy condiment made from boiled lemons and sugar. The lemons are boiled multiple times to remove bitterness and then cooked in a sugar syrup until they become clear and tender. Lemon preserves can be used as a topping for desserts, added to cocktails, or used as a flavoring in various dishes.

## Ingredients:
- Lemons
- Sugar
- Water

## Instructions:
1. Thinly pare the lemons, removing the outer yellow peel. Grate off the tops of the lemons.
2. Cut a small hole where the stalk grows and pick out all the seeds from the lemons.
3. Boil the lemons three times in three separate waters until they become very tender. Drain after each boiling.
4. Bring a pot of water to a boil.
5. In a separate pot, combine half a pound of sugar for every lemon and a quarter of a pint of water for every half pound of sugar.
6. Boil the sugar syrup, skimming off any impurities that rise to the surface.
7. Add the boiled lemons to the syrup and let them boil rapidly until they become very clear.
8. Squeeze in the juice of a lemon and continue boiling the mixture for three to four more boils.
