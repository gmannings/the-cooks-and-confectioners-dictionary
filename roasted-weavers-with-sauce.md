# Roasted Weavers with Sauce

## Description
This recipe is for roasting weavers, a type of fish. The weavers are larded with bits of eel and anchovies, then roasted on a spit. While they are roasting, a marinade of fish broth, vinegar, salt, pepper, slices of lemon, slices of onion, and whole chives is basted onto the fish. The sauce is made by browning butter with flour, then adding minced mushrooms, truffle, chives, and parsley. Fish broth is added to moisten the mixture, and it is simmered until thickened. Capers and an anchovy are added, along with a good cullis (a type of sauce thickener). The roasted weavers are then served with the sauce poured over them.

## Options and commentary
- Instead of larding the weavers with eel and anchovies, you can use bacon.
- For the basting liquid, you can use a mixture of Westphalia ham essence, vinegar, salt, pepper, butter, slices of lemon, sliced onions, and whole chives.
- The weavers can also be served with a ragout of Westphalia ham.
