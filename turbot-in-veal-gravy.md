# Turbot in Veal Gravy

## Description
This recipe is for cooking turbot in a rich veal gravy. The turbot is seasoned with salt, pepper, onions, cloves, bay leaf, and herbs, and then cooked in a saucepan with bacon and veal. The gravy is made by browning butter and flour, adding broth, and scraping off the browned bits from the saucepan. The turbot is then covered with bacon, and the veal gravy and champagne wine are poured over it. The dish is stewed until the fish is cooked through, and then allowed to stand for two hours to develop the flavors. It can be served with a ragout of mushrooms, truffles, veal sweetbreads, and cockscombs, or a ragout of crayfish.

## Options and commentary
- For a vegetarian version, use butter and vegetable broth instead of bacon and veal.
- The ragout can be customized with other ingredients such as carrots, peas, or asparagus.
- The cooking time may vary depending on the size and thickness of the turbot.
