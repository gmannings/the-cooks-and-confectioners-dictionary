## Instructions:
1. In a large bowl, whip the egg whites until they form stiff peaks.
2. In a saucepan, heat the milk over medium heat until it starts to steam.
3. Add the orange flower water and sugar to the milk and stir until the sugar has dissolved.
4. Slowly pour the milk mixture into the whipped egg whites, gently folding it in until well combined.
5. Place a plate over a stove burner and sprinkle the cinnamon stick on top.
6. Pour the cream mixture onto the plate and spread it out evenly.
7. Using a red hot shovel or a kitchen torch, carefully brown the top of the cream until it forms a caramelized crust.
