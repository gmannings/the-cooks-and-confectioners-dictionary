# Dressed Crabs

## Description
Dressed Crabs is a classic seafood dish where the meat from boiled crabs is removed from their shells and claws, diced, and then cooked with white wine, orange juice, and spices. The mixture is then placed back into the cleaned crab shells and served with the crab legs arranged around them.

## Ingredients:
- 2 crabs
- 100 ml white wine
- Juice of 1 orange
- 1/4 teaspoon nutmeg
- 1 orange, sliced

## Instructions:
1. Fill a large pot with water and bring it to a boil.
2. Carefully place the crabs into the boiling water and cook for about 10 minutes, or until they turn bright red.
3. Remove the crabs from the pot and let them cool slightly.
4. Once the crabs are cool enough to handle, carefully remove the meat from their shells and claws. Cut the meat into small dice-sized pieces.
5. In a small saucepan or pipkin, combine the diced crab meat, white wine, orange juice, nutmeg, and sliced orange.
6. Place the saucepan over low heat and warm the mixture for about 5 minutes, stirring occasionally.
7. While the mixture is warming, thoroughly clean the crab shells.
8. Once the mixture is warmed through, carefully spoon the crab mixture back into the cleaned crab shells.
9. Arrange the crab legs around the filled shells on a serving dish.
10. Serve the dressed crabs immediately.
