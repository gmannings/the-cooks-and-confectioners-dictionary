# Broiled Weavers with Lettuce Ragout

## Description
This recipe is for broiled weavers (a type of fish) served with a flavorful lettuce ragout. The weavers are scored, rubbed with butter and salt, and then broiled until they have a nice color. The lettuce hearts are blanched, then cooked in a saucepan with butter, flour, fish broth, salt, pepper, and herbs to create a delicious ragout. The ragout is then poured onto a serving dish, and the broiled weavers are placed on top. This dish can be served with various sauces or ragouts, such as crayfish cullis, anchovy sauce, or mushroom or truffle ragout.

## Options and commentary
- Instead of weavers, you can use any firm white fish fillets, such as cod or haddock.
- Feel free to experiment with different herbs and spices in the ragout to suit your taste.
- Serve the dish with your choice of sauce or ragout, such as crayfish cullis, anchovy sauce, or mushroom or truffle ragout.

## Ingredients:
- 4 weaver fillets (or any firm white fish fillets)
- Butter, for rubbing
- Salt, to taste
- 4 lettuce hearts
- 2 tablespoons butter
- 1 tablespoon flour
- 1 cup fish broth
- Salt and pepper, to taste
- 1 faggot of sweet herbs (such as parsley, thyme, and bay leaf)
- Optional: crayfish cullis, anchovy sauce, mushroom ragout, or truffle ragout for serving

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the broiler in your oven.
2. Gut, wash, and dry the weaver fillets using a clean cloth.
3. Score the sides of the fillets with shallow cuts.
4. Rub the fillets well with butter and sprinkle with salt.
5. Place the fillets on a greased broiler pan or grill rack.
6. Broil the fillets under the preheated broiler, turning them often, until they are cooked through and have a nice color. This should take about 8-10 minutes, depending on the thickness of the fillets. Keep an eye on them to prevent burning.
7. While the fillets are broiling, prepare the lettuce ragout. Blanch the lettuce hearts in hot water for a few minutes until they are slightly wilted. Then, transfer them to a bowl of cold water to stop the cooking process.
8. Squeeze out the excess water from the blanched lettuce hearts, one by one, using your hands.
9. In a saucepan, melt the butter over medium heat. Add the flour and cook, stirring constantly, until it turns brown and has a nutty aroma.
10. Cut the blanched lettuce hearts in half and add them to the saucepan. Stir them around in the butter and flour mixture for a few minutes.
11. Pour in the fish broth and add salt, pepper, and the faggot of sweet herbs. Stir everything together.
12. Reduce the heat to low and let the ragout simmer gently for about 10-15 minutes, or until the lettuce hearts are tender and the flavors have melded together. Stir occasionally.
13. Once the ragout is done, remove the faggot of sweet herbs and any excess fat from the surface.
14. If desired, add your choice of sauce or ragout to the ragout, such as crayfish cullis, anchovy sauce, mushroom ragout, or truffle ragout. Stir well to combine.
15. To serve, pour the ragout onto a serving dish and arrange the broiled weaver fillets on top.
16. Serve the broiled weavers with lettuce ragout hot.
