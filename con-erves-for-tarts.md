# Conſerves for Tarts

## Description
This recipe is for making fruit preserves that can be used as a filling for tarts. The preserves are made by baking the fruit with sugar and water, straining it, and then boiling it with spices and more sugar until it reaches a jelly-like consistency. The preserves can be stored in pots for future use.

## Ingredients:
- Assorted fruits of your choice (e.g. apples, pears, peaches, berries)
- Sugar
- Water
- Nutmeg
- Cinnamon
- Mace

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 350°F (180°C).
2. Peel the fruits and remove the cores or stones.
3. Place the peeled and cored fruits in a pot.
4. Add a little water and sugar to the pot, enough to cover the fruits.
5. Bake the fruits in the preheated oven for about 30 minutes, or until they are soft and cooked through.
6. Remove the pot from the oven and let the fruits cool slightly.
7. Transfer the cooked fruits to a linen cloth and strain them to remove any solids.
8. In a separate bowl, mix together nutmeg, cinnamon, mace, and double-refined sugar in equal quantities.
9. Add the strained fruit puree to the bowl with the sugar and spice mixture.
10. Place the bowl over a gentle fire or low heat on the stove.
11. Stir the mixture continuously until it thickens and reaches a jelly-like consistency. This may take about 30-45 minutes.
12. Once the mixture has thickened, remove it from the heat.
13. Transfer the preserves to clean, sterilized pots for storage.
14. Allow the preserves to cool completely before sealing the pots.
