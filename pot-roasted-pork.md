# Pot Roasted Pork

## Description
Pot Roasted Pork is a traditional dish where a leg of pork is cut into pieces, seasoned with salt and pepper, and cooked slowly in a pot with herbs and butter. The pork is then pressed down and covered with clarified butter before being stored in a cool place. This method of cooking results in tender and flavorful pork.

## Ingredients:
- 1 leg of pork, cut into pieces
- Salt
- Pepper
- 1 tablespoon fresh rosemary, finely chopped
- 1 tablespoon fresh sage, finely chopped
- 1 pound (450 grams) unsalted butter

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 325°F (160°C).
2. In a mortar, pound the pieces of pork until they are well tenderized.
3. Season the pork pieces generously with salt and pepper.
4. In a bowl, mix together the chopped rosemary and sage.
5. Sprinkle the herb mixture over the seasoned pork pieces, ensuring they are evenly coated.
6. Place the seasoned pork pieces in a pot.
7. Cut the butter into chunks and scatter them over the pork.
8. Cover the pot with a lid or aluminum foil.
9. Place the pot in the preheated oven and bake for about 2-3 hours, or until the pork is tender and cooked through.
10. Once cooked, remove the pot from the oven and carefully drain the pork from the excess gravy.
11. Press the pork down firmly into a dry pot to remove any excess liquid.
12. Skim off all the butter from the gravy and set it aside.
13. In a separate saucepan, melt the reserved butter over low heat until it becomes clear and separated from any solids. This is called clarifying the butter.
14. Once the butter is clarified, pour enough of it over the pressed pork to create a layer about 1 inch (2.5 cm) thick.
15. Cover the pot with a piece of wet paper to prevent the pork from drying out.
16. Place the pot in a cool place, such as a refrigerator, to allow the pork to set and the flavors to develop. Leave it for at least 24 hours before serving.
