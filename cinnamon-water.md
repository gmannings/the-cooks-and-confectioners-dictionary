# Cinnamon Water

## Description
Cinnamon Water is a fragrant and flavorful liquid made by distilling a mixture of cinnamon, white wine, and rosewater. It was a popular drink in the 18th century and was believed to have various health benefits.

## Options and commentary
- You can adjust the amount of cinnamon used according to your taste preference.
- If you don't have white wine, you can substitute it with apple cider or grape juice.
- Rosewater can be found in specialty stores or online, but if you can't find it, you can use rose extract or rose syrup as a substitute.

## Ingredients:
- 2 pounds (approx. 900 grams) of cinnamon sticks
- 1 pint (473 ml) of white wine
- 1 gallon (3.8 liters) of rosewater

## Instructions:
1. In a large vessel, bruise the cinnamon sticks by gently crushing them with a rolling pin or the back of a knife. This will help release the flavors during the distillation process.
2. Add the bruised cinnamon sticks to the vessel.
3. Pour in the white wine and rosewater.
4. Close the vessel tightly to ensure a proper seal.
5. Fill a larger container or basin with warm water.
6. Place the sealed vessel in the warm water, making sure it is stable and won't tip over.
7. Find a furnace or stovetop where you can maintain a gentle boil of the water in the larger container. This will create a steam bath for the vessel.
8. Place the vessel in the steam bath and make sure the water continues to boil.
9. Allow the mixture to distill for several hours, ensuring that the water in the larger container doesn't run out. You may need to add more water as needed.
10. As the mixture distills, the steam will rise, condense, and collect in the vessel's lid or a separate container.
11. Once the distillation process is complete, carefully remove the vessel from the steam bath and let it cool.
12. Strain the cinnamon water through a fine-mesh sieve or cheesecloth to remove any sediment or impurities.
13. Transfer the strained cinnamon water to a clean bottle or container.
14. Store the cinnamon water in a cool, dark place. It can be refrigerated to prolong its shelf life.

## Cooking time
Several hours for the distillation process.
