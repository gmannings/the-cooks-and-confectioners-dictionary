# Wenison Pafkv

## Description
Wenison Pafkv is a traditional 18th century dish made with venison, beef suet, and a pastry crust. The meat is seasoned with pepper and salt, then enclosed in the pastry and baked. This dish can also be made with beef or mutton instead of venison.

## Options and commentary
- Instead of using venison, you can use beef or mutton for this recipe.
- If you prefer a richer flavor, you can marinate the meat in red wine before baking.
- You can add additional herbs and spices to the meat for extra flavor.

## Ingredients:
- 1/2 peck (approximately 9 liters) of flour
- 2 pounds (900 grams) of butter
- Cold water
- 12 egg whites
- 1 pound (450 grams) of beef suet
- Venison, beef, or mutton (amount depends on personal preference)
- Pepper
- Salt
- Claret (red wine)
- Water
- Nutmeg

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F).
2. In a large mixing bowl, combine the flour and butter. Mix until the mixture resembles breadcrumbs.
3. Gradually add cold water to the mixture, mixing with your hands, until a dough forms. The dough should be firm but pliable.
4. Add the egg whites to the dough and continue to mix until well combined.
5. On a lightly floured surface, roll out the dough using a rolling pin until it is approximately 1/4 inch thick.
6. In a separate bowl, beat the beef suet with a rolling pin until it is well flattened.
7. Prepare the venison (or beef/mutton) by either boning it or breaking the bones. Rub the meat with pepper and salt.
8. Place the seasoned meat onto the rolled-out dough, leaving space around the edges.
9. Spread the beaten suet over the meat.
10. Fold the edges of the dough over the meat to enclose it completely. Press the edges together to seal.
11. Place the pastry-wrapped meat onto a baking sheet or in a baking dish.
12. If using boned venison, place the bones into a pan. Add claret, water, salt, pepper, and nutmeg to the pan. 
13. Bake the pastry-wrapped meat in the preheated oven for approximately 1 hour, or until the pastry is golden brown and the meat is cooked to your desired level of doneness.
14. If using boned venison, strain the liquid from the pan and pour it over the pastry-wrapped meat when it comes out of the oven.
15. Allow the Wenison Pafkv to cool slightly before serving.
