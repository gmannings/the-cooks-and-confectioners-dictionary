# Pickled Trout

## Description
Pickled trout is a preserved fish dish that has been popular since the 18th century. The trout is cooked in a flavorful mixture of water, vinegar, spices, and herbs, and then left to marinate in the pickle until ready to be enjoyed. This dish is tangy, aromatic, and makes for a great appetizer or addition to a charcuterie board.

## Ingredients:
- 2 trout fillets
- 500 ml water
- 500 ml white vinegar
- 1 tablespoon mixed whole spices (such as peppercorns, mustard seeds, coriander seeds)
- 1 small bundle of fresh herbs (such as dill, thyme, parsley)

## Instructions:
1. In a large pot, combine the water, vinegar, spices, and herbs. Bring the mixture to a boil over medium heat.
2. Once the mixture is boiling, carefully add the trout fillets to the pot.
3. Reduce the heat to low and simmer the trout in the pickle for about 10-15 minutes, or until the fish is cooked through and flakes easily with a fork.
4. Using a slotted spoon, remove the trout fillets from the pickle and transfer them to a clean jar or container.
5. Pour the hot pickle liquid over the trout, making sure the fish is completely covered.
6. Allow the pickled trout to cool to room temperature, then cover the jar or container with a lid and refrigerate.
7. Let the pickled trout marinate in the pickle for at least 24 hours before serving. The longer it sits, the more flavorful it will become.

## Cooking time
Approximately 10-15 minutes for cooking the trout fillets. Additional time required for marinating in the pickle.
