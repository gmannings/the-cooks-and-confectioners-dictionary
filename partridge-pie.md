# Partridge Pie

## Description
Partridge Pie is a delicious and hearty dish made with partridges, bacon, mushrooms, and a flavorful filling. The partridges are stuffed with a mixture of veal, bacon, mushrooms, and herbs, then wrapped in a pastry crust and baked until golden and crispy. The pie is then served with a rich cullis sauce made from partridges, sweetbreads, mushrooms, and truffles. This dish is perfect for a special occasion or a cozy family dinner.

## Options and commentary
- Instead of partridges, you can use other game birds like woodcocks, larks, chickens, pigeons, thrushes, or quails.
- If you don't have access to veal, you can use ground pork or beef as a substitute.
- Feel free to adjust the seasonings and herbs according to your taste preferences.
- The cullis sauce adds a rich and flavorful element to the pie, but if you prefer a simpler dish, you can omit it or serve the pie with a side of gravy or sauce of your choice.

  - Juice of 1 lemon

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F).
2. Prepare the partridges by removing the feathers, guts, and feet. Set aside the livers.
3. Truss the partridges by tying the legs together with kitchen twine.
4. Place the partridges on a cutting board and gently flatten them with a rolling pin.
5. Lard the partridges by inserting lardons of bacon and gammon into the meat.
6. Season the partridges with salt and pepper, then make a small slit in the back of each partridge.
7. In a bowl, combine the minced veal, marrow, raw bacon, mushrooms, truffles, veal suet, and chopped herbs. Mix well.
8. Bind the filling mixture with the egg yolk.
9. Stuff the partridges with the filling mixture, using a spoon or your hands to pack it tightly.
10. Pound the partridge livers with some bacon and season with beaten spices.
11. In a separate bowl, combine the flour, butter, salt, and egg to make a pastry dough.
12. Roll out two sheets of pastry dough. Place one sheet on a buttered piece of parchment paper.
13. Spread a layer of pounded livers on the pastry sheet.
14. Place the partridges on top of the livers, breaking their backs to fit them in the pie.
15. Add sliced mushrooms, truffles, and a bay leaf on top of the partridges.
16. Cover the filling with thin slices of bacon.
17. Place the second sheet of pastry dough on top of the pie filling.
18. Seal the edges of the pie by pressing the two sheets of pastry dough together.
19. Brush the top of the pie with beaten egg or milk for a golden crust.
20. Place the pie in the preheated oven and bake for approximately 1 hour or until the pastry is golden and crispy.
21. While the pie is baking, prepare the cullis sauce. In a saucepan, combine the partridge carcasses, sweetbreads, mushrooms, and truffles. Cook over medium heat until browned.
22. Add enough water to cover the ingredients and simmer for 1-2 hours to extract the flavors.
23. Strain the mixture through a fine sieve, pressing down on the solids to extract as much liquid as possible.
24. Skim off any fat from the surface of the sauce and squeeze in the juice of a lemon.
25. Once the pie is cooked, remove it from the oven and carefully remove the parchment paper from the bottom.
26. Cut the pie into slices and pour the hot cullis sauce over the pie.
27. Place the lid back on the pie and serve it as a side dish for a delicious and elegant meal.

## Cooking time
Approximately 1 hour for baking the pie. Additional time required for preparing the cullis sauce.
