# Preserving Anchovies

## Description
This recipe is for preserving anchovies using bay salt. Preserved anchovies can be used as a flavorful addition to various dishes, such as salads, pasta, or as a topping for pizza.

## Ingredients:
- Fresh anchovies
- Bay salt (enough to cover the anchovies)

## Instructions:
1. Clean the anchovies by removing the heads, guts, and scales. Rinse them thoroughly under cold water.
2. Place a layer of bay salt at the bottom of a clean, airtight container.
3. Arrange a layer of cleaned anchovies on top of the salt, making sure they are not overlapping.
4. Cover the layer of anchovies with another layer of bay salt, ensuring that they are completely covered.
5. Continue layering anchovies and salt until all the anchovies are used, making sure each layer is covered with salt.
6. Once all the anchovies are layered and covered with salt, seal the container tightly.
7. Store the container in a cool, dark place, such as a refrigerator or cellar, for at least 3 months to allow the anchovies to cure and develop flavor.
8. After the curing period, the anchovies can be rinsed under cold water to remove excess salt before using.

## Options and commentary
- You can add additional flavorings to the anchovies, such as herbs or spices, before layering them with salt.
- If you prefer a less salty taste, you can soak the preserved anchovies in milk or water for a few minutes before using them in recipes.
- Preserved anchovies can be stored for up to a year if kept in a cool, dark place.

## Cooking time
