# Norfolk Fool

## Description
Norfolk Fool is a traditional English dessert made with layers of bread soaked in a creamy custard. It is a simple and comforting dish that is perfect for a cozy dessert.

## Options and commentary
- You can add a sprinkle of sugar and a pinch of nutmeg between each layer of bread for added flavor.
- You can serve the Norfolk Fool warm or chilled, depending on your preference.

## Ingredients:
- 750 ml cream
- 1 cinnamon stick
- 1 tsp whole mace
- 9 egg yolks
- 1 loaf of white bread, crusts removed and sliced

## Instructions:
1. In a saucepan, combine the cream, cinnamon stick, and whole mace. Bring to a boil over medium heat.
2. In a separate bowl, beat the egg yolks until well combined.
3. Remove the saucepan from the heat and remove the cinnamon stick and mace.
4. Gradually pour the beaten egg yolks into the hot cream, whisking constantly to prevent curdling.
5. Return the saucepan to low heat and cook the custard mixture, stirring constantly, until it thickens enough to coat the back of a spoon. This should take about 5-7 minutes. Do not let it boil.
6. Remove the custard from the heat and let it cool slightly.
7. Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F).
8. In a baking dish, arrange a layer of bread slices to cover the bottom of the dish.
9. Pour a layer of the custard over the bread, making sure to soak the bread slices evenly.
10. Repeat the layers of bread and custard until the dish is full, ending with a layer of custard on top.
11. Place the baking dish in the preheated oven and bake for about 20-25 minutes, or until the top is golden brown and the custard is set.
12. Remove from the oven and let it cool slightly before serving.
13. Optionally, garnish with some carved sippets (small pieces of toasted bread) around the edges of the dish.
