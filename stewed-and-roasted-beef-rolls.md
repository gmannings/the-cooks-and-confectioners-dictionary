# Stewed and Roasted Beef Rolls

## Description
This recipe involves slicing beef, stuffing it with a flavorful mixture, and then either baking or roasting it. The rolls are then stewed in a rich gravy and served with vegetables and garnishes.

## Options and commentary
- Instead of buttock of beef, you can use beef sirloin or tenderloin.
- Instead of larding the beef with small lard, you can use bacon or pancetta.
- Instead of barberries, you can use cranberries or currants.
- Instead of sippets (small pieces of toasted bread), you can serve the rolls with mashed potatoes or rice.
- Instead of orange, lemon, barberries, and grapes, you can use any combination of citrus slices and berries for garnish.

- 500g beef sirloin or tenderloin, sliced into thin slices
