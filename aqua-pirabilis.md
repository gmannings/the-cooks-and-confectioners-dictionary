## Description
Aqua Pirabilis is a type of flavored spirit that was popular in the 18th century. It is made by infusing a mixture of spices and herbs in aqua-vitae (a strong distilled spirit) and white wine, and then distilling the mixture to create a fragrant and flavorful spirit.

## Instructions:
1. In a mortar and pestle, grind the cloves, mace, ginger, saffron, cubebs, galingal, cardamom, and nutmegs until they are well crushed and combined.
2. In a large glass container, combine the crushed spices with the aqua-vitae, white wine, and juice of celandine. Mix well.
3. Cover the glass container and let the mixture infuse for 12 hours.
4. After the infusion period, set up a glass still and transfer the infused mixture into the still.
