# Grilled Herrings with Herb Butter Sauce

## Description
This recipe is for grilling fresh herrings and serving them with a flavorful herb butter sauce. The herrings are gutted, washed, and coated with breadcrumbs before being grilled to perfection. The sauce is made with a combination of vinegar, butter, herbs, and other seasonings, adding a tangy and savory element to the dish.

## Ingredients:
- 4 fresh herrings
- 2 tablespoons melted butter
- 4 tablespoons breadcrumbs
- 2 tablespoons vinegar
- 2 tablespoons butter
- Salt and pepper to taste
- 1 tablespoon mustard (optional)
- 1 tablespoon chopped fresh herbs (such as parsley, dill, or chives)
- 2 anchovy fillets, finely chopped (optional)
- 1 tablespoon capers (optional)

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the grill to medium-high heat.
2. Gut the herrings by making a small incision through the gills and removing the innards. Rinse the herrings under cold water to clean them thoroughly.
3. Pat the herrings dry with paper towels.
4. Brush the herrings with melted butter, ensuring they are evenly coated.
5. Sprinkle breadcrumbs over the herrings, pressing lightly to adhere them to the surface.
6. Place the herrings on a preheated grill and cook for about 4-5 minutes per side, or until they are cooked through and the breadcrumbs are golden brown. Flip the herrings carefully to avoid breaking them.
7. While the herrings are grilling, prepare the sauce. In a small saucepan, melt the butter over low heat.
8. Add the chopped herbs, vinegar, salt, pepper, mustard (if using), anchovies (if using), and capers (if using) to the melted butter. Stir well to combine.
9. Cook the sauce over low heat for a few minutes, allowing the flavors to meld together. Taste and adjust the seasonings if needed.
10. Remove the herrings from the grill and transfer them to a serving platter.
11. Pour the herb butter sauce over the grilled herrings, ensuring they are well coated.
12. Serve the herrings immediately with extra sauce on the side.
