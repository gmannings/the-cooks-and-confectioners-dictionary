# Strong Mead

## Description
Strong Mead is a traditional alcoholic beverage made from honey and water. This recipe produces a strong and flavorful mead with the addition of spices and citrus peel.

## Options and commentary
- You can adjust the amount of honey to your preference for sweetness and strength of the mead.
- Adding a sprig of rosemary while boiling the mead will give it a subtle herbal flavor.
- The spices and citrus peel can be adjusted according to your taste preferences.

## Ingredients:
- 15 liters of water
- 6 kg of honey
- 6 egg whites
- 1 sprig of rosemary (optional)
- 4 pieces of ginger root (about 20g), crushed
- 1 nutmeg, grated
- 1 teaspoon of cloves, ground
- 1 teaspoon of mace, ground
- Peel of 3 lemons

## Instructions:
1. In a large pot, combine the water and honey. Stir until the honey is fully dissolved.
2. In a separate bowl, beat the egg whites until frothy. Add the beaten egg whites to the pot of water and honey, stirring well to incorporate.
3. If using, add the sprig of rosemary to the pot.
4. Place the pot on the stove and bring the mixture to a boil. Reduce the heat to low and let it simmer for 1.5 hours, skimming off any impurities that rise to the surface.
5. While the mead is simmering, prepare a toast and spread it with yeast. Set it aside to activate the yeast.
6. After the simmering time, remove the pot from the heat and let the mead cool to room temperature.
7. Once the mead has cooled, strain out the rosemary (if used) and transfer the liquid to a fermentation vessel.
8. Add the crushed ginger, grated nutmeg, ground cloves, ground mace, and lemon peel to a muslin cloth or cheesecloth. Tie it securely and hang it in the fermentation vessel.
9. Add the activated yeast toast to the fermentation vessel and seal it with an airlock or a tight-fitting lid.
10. Allow the mead to ferment for several weeks or until it stops bubbling. This can take anywhere from a few weeks to a few months.
11. Once fermentation is complete, transfer the mead to bottles, leaving behind any sediment at the bottom of the fermentation vessel.
12. Seal the bottles and let the mead age for at least 6 months to develop its flavors.
