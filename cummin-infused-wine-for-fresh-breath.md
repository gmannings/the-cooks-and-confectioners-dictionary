# Cummin Infused Wine for Fresh Breath

## Description
This recipe is a simple remedy for freshening the breath. It involves infusing cummin powder in wine and drinking it twice a day for two weeks. Cummin, also known as cumin, has been used for centuries for its aromatic and digestive properties.

## Ingredients:
- 2 handfuls of cummin seeds
- 1 bottle of red or white wine (750 ml)

## Instructions:
1. Grind the cummin seeds into a fine powder using a mortar and pestle or a spice grinder.
2. In a saucepan, combine the cummin powder and the wine.
3. Place the saucepan over medium heat and bring the mixture to a gentle simmer.
4. Reduce the heat to low and let the cummin infuse in the wine for about 10 minutes, stirring occasionally.
5. Remove the saucepan from the heat and let the mixture cool to room temperature.
6. Once cooled, strain the cummin-infused wine through a fine-mesh sieve or cheesecloth to remove any sediment or particles.
7. Transfer the infused wine to a clean bottle or container with a tight-fitting lid.
8. Store the cummin-infused wine in the refrigerator.
9. Drink a small glass of the infused wine every morning and night for a period of two weeks.
