# Seasoned Eel Pie

## Description
This recipe is for a traditional Eel Pie, a dish popular in the 18th century. The eels are seasoned with a blend of spices and baked in a pastry crust. The result is a savory and flavorful pie.

## Ingredients:
- 1 pound eel fillets
- Salt, to taste
- Pepper, to taste
- 1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg
- 1/2 teaspoon ground cloves
- 1/2 teaspoon ground mace
- 1 sheet of puff pastry
- 2 tablespoons butter, diced

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F).
2. Roll out the puff pastry and line a pie dish with it, either in an oval or round shape.
3. Cut the eel fillets into bite-sized pieces.
4. In a small bowl, mix together the salt, pepper, nutmeg, cloves, and mace.
5. Season the eel pieces with the spice mixture, making sure they are evenly coated.
6. Place the seasoned eel pieces in the pastry-lined pie dish.
7. Dot the diced butter on top of the eel pieces.
8. Break some whole mace into sprigs and scatter them on top of the eel pieces.
9. Place another layer of puff pastry on top of the pie, sealing the edges with water and crimping them with a fork.
10. Cut a few slits in the top pastry to allow steam to escape during baking.
11. Bake the pie in the preheated oven for 45-50 minutes, or until the pastry is golden brown and the eel is cooked through.
12. Remove the pie from the oven and let it cool for a few minutes before serving.
