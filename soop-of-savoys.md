# Soop of Savoys

## Description
Soop of Savoys is a hearty and flavorful dish made with Savoy cabbage, broth or gravy, and various meat options. The cabbage is boiled, squeezed to remove excess water, and then stewed in broth or gravy for two hours. It is often served with fried duck or ducklings, or stuffed pigeons, along with a garnish of bacon and slices of Savoy cabbage.

## Options and commentary
- Meat options: You can choose to fry off a duck or ducklings, or stew them with the Savoys. Alternatively, you can stuff pigeons with veal forced-meat and stew them with the Savoys. You can also add a piece of bacon stuck with cloves for added flavor.
- Garnish: Garnish the dish with a rim and lay slices of bacon on the outside, with a piece of Savoy cabbage between each slice.
- Bread: Soak bread in good broth or gravy and place it in the dish before adding the fowls and Savoys.
