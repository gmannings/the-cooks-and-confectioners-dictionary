# Yellow Pudding

## Description
Yellow Pudding is a traditional 18th-century dessert made with bread, cream, eggs, spices, and dried fruits. It has a rich and custard-like texture with a yellow color from the addition of saffron.

## Options and commentary
- You can substitute the beef suet with butter or vegetable shortening for a vegetarian version.
- Feel free to adjust the amount of spices and dried fruits according to your taste preferences.
- Serve the pudding warm or chilled, with a dollop of whipped cream or a sprinkle of powdered sugar on top.

## Ingredients:
- 3 penny white loaves, grated
- 3 pints (1.4 liters) of cream
- 3-4 eggs
- Pinch of salt
- 1/4 teaspoon ground cloves
- 1/4 teaspoon ground mace
- A pinch of saffron threads, soaked in 1 tablespoon of warm water
- 3/4 pound (340 grams) beef suet, finely chopped
- 3/4 pound (340 grams) dates, pitted and chopped
- 1 tablespoon rose water
- 1/2 cup (75 grams) currants
- 1/2 cup (100 grams) sugar

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 350°F (180°C).
2. In a large mixing bowl, combine the grated bread, cream, and eggs. Mix well until the bread is soaked and the mixture is well combined.
3. Add the salt, ground cloves, ground mace, and soaked saffron (including the water) to the bread mixture. Stir to evenly distribute the spices.
4. Add the beef suet, dates, rose water, currants, and sugar to the bowl. Mix everything together until well combined.
5. Grease a deep baking dish with butter or cooking spray. Pour the pudding mixture into the dish, spreading it out evenly.

7. Remove the pudding from the oven and let it cool for a few minutes before serving.
8. Serve the yellow pudding warm or chilled, as desired.
