# Stewed Mussels

## Description
Stewed mussels are a classic seafood dish where mussels are cooked in a flavorful broth and served in their shells. The mussels are first boiled in beer and salt to cook them, then removed from the shells and cleaned. They are then fried in butter to add richness and flavor. The mussels are then simmered in a mixture of butter, white wine, sliced orange, egg yolks, and fresh herbs to create a creamy and aromatic sauce. Finally, the stewed mussels are served in scallop shells for an elegant presentation.

## Ingredients:
- 1 kg mussels
- 500 ml beer
- Salt
- 50 g butter
- 100 ml white wine
- 1 orange, sliced
- 3-4 egg yolks
- Fresh herbs (such as parsley or chives), finely chopped

## Instructions:
1. Wash the mussels thoroughly to remove any dirt or debris.
2. In a large pot, bring the beer and a pinch of salt to a boil.
3. Add the mussels to the pot and cook them until they open, about 5-7 minutes. Discard any mussels that do not open.
4. Remove the mussels from the shells and discard the shells.
5. Remove the beards from the mussels (the fibrous threads sticking out from the shells) and discard.
6. Rinse the mussels under cold water to remove any remaining grit or sand.
7. In a large frying pan, melt the butter over medium heat.
8. Add the mussels to the pan and fry them for 2-3 minutes, stirring occasionally.
9. Pour out the butter from the pan.
10. In the same pan, add a fresh piece of butter, white wine, sliced orange, and a pinch of salt.
11. Stir in the egg yolks and fresh herbs.
12. Cook the mixture for a few minutes until the sauce thickens slightly and the flavors meld together.
13. Return the fried mussels to the pan and toss them in the sauce to coat.
14. Simmer the mussels in the sauce for another 2-3 minutes to heat them through.
15. Serve the stewed mussels in scallop shells for an elegant presentation.
