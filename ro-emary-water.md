# Roſemary Water

## Description
Roſemary Water is a fragrant herbal infusion made with rosemary, elecampane-root, sage, anniseeds, cloves, and white wine. It was commonly used in the 18th century for medicinal purposes and as a refreshing drink.

## Options and commentary
- You can adjust the quantities of the ingredients according to your taste preferences.
- If you don't have access to elecampane-root, you can substitute it with ginger root.
- Balneo Mariæ refers to a water bath, so you will need a double boiler or a heatproof bowl set over a pot of simmering water for the distillation process.

## Ingredients:
- 113 grams of rosemary (flowers and leaves)
- 113 grams of elecampane-root (or ginger root)
- 1/2 handful of red sage
- 170 grams of anniseeds
- 42 grams of cloves
- 3.8 liters of white wine

## Instructions:
1. In a mortar and pestle, pound the rosemary, elecampane-root (or ginger root), and red sage together until they are well crushed.
2. In a separate mortar and pestle, grind the anniseeds and cloves individually until they are finely ground.
3. In a large container, combine the crushed herbs, ground anniseeds, ground cloves, and white wine.
4. Stir the mixture well to ensure all the ingredients are evenly distributed.
5. Cover the container and let it infuse for one week at room temperature.
6. After one week, set up a double boiler or place a heatproof bowl over a pot of simmering water.
7. Strain the infused mixture into the top of the double boiler or the heatproof bowl.
8. Heat the water in the bottom pot or pan, allowing the infused mixture to gently heat and release the aromatic compounds.
9. Collect the condensed liquid that drips from the top of the double boiler or the heatproof bowl. This is the roſemary water.
10. Allow the roſemary water to cool before transferring it to a clean, airtight container.
11. Store the roſemary water in a cool, dark place.

## Cooking time
- Infusion: 1 week
