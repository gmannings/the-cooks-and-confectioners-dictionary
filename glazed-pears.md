# Glazed Pears

## Description
Glazed pears are a sweet and elegant dessert that can be enjoyed on their own or used as a topping for cakes, tarts, or ice cream. The pears are soaked in sweet wort to enhance their flavor and then baked until tender. After baking, they are dried in a warm oven to achieve a glazed and slightly chewy texture.

## Ingredients:
- 4 large and ripe pears
- 500 ml sweet wort (or substitute with sweet white wine or apple juice)

## Instructions:
1. Peel the pears, leaving the stems intact. Cut a small slice off the bottom of each pear to create a flat base for them to stand on.
2. Place the peeled pears in a shallow dish and pour the sweet wort over them. Make sure the pears are fully submerged. If needed, use a small plate or weight to keep them submerged. Let the pears soak in the sweet wort for 2-3 days in the refrigerator.
3. Preheat the oven to 180째C (350째F).
4. Remove the pears from the sweet wort and pat them dry with a paper towel.
5. Place the pears in an earthenware or oven-safe preserving pan, arranging them in a single layer.
6. Bake the pears in the preheated oven for about 30-40 minutes, or until they are tender when pierced with a fork.
7. Remove the pan from the oven and transfer the pears to a wire rack or lattice to cool.
8. Preheat the oven to a low temperature, around 80째C (175째F).
9. Place the wire rack or lattice with the pears back into the warm oven. Make sure the pears are evenly spaced and not touching each other.
10. Leave the pears in the warm oven, turning them twice a day, until they are dry and have a glazed appearance. This process may take several days, depending on the size and moisture content of the pears.
11. Once the pears are dry, remove them from the oven and let them cool completely before serving or storing.
