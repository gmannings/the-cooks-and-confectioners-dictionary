# Puff Pastry with Apples and Candied Orange Peel

## Description
This recipe is a modern take on the 18th-century puff pastry recipe. It features layers of buttery puff pastry filled with slices of apples and candied orange peel. The pastries are then baked until golden and crispy. They make for a delicious and elegant dessert or snack.

## Ingredients:
- 1 sheet of store-bought puff pastry
- 2 apples (such as Granny Smith or Pink Lady), thinly sliced
- 1/4 cup candied orange peel, cut into long slices
- 2 tablespoons melted butter
- 1 tablespoon rose water
- 2 tablespoons granulated sugar

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 200°C (400°F) and line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
2. Roll out the puff pastry sheet on a lightly floured surface to a thickness of about 1/4 inch.
3. Cut the puff pastry into rectangles or squares, depending on your preference.
4. Place a few slices of apple and a few slices of candied orange peel on one half of each pastry piece, leaving a small border around the edges.
5. Sprinkle a little granulated sugar over the apple and orange peel.
6. Fold the other half of the pastry over the filling and press the edges together to seal.
7. In a small bowl, mix together the melted butter and rose water.
8. Brush the tops of the pastries with the melted butter and rose water mixture.
9. Sprinkle the pastries with a little more granulated sugar.
10. Place the pastries on the prepared baking sheet and bake in the preheated oven for about 15-20 minutes, or until golden brown and puffed up.
11. Remove from the oven and let cool for a few minutes before serving.
