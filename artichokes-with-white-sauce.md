# Artichokes with White Sauce

## Description
This recipe is for boiled artichokes served with a creamy white sauce. The artichokes are cooked until tender and then tossed with butter and parsley. The sauce is made with egg yolks, vinegar, and gravy, giving it a tangy and savory flavor.

## Ingredients:
- 4 artichokes
- 2 tablespoons butter
- 2 tablespoons chopped parsley
- Salt, to taste
- White pepper, to taste
- 2 egg yolks
- 1-2 drops of vinegar
- 1/4 cup gravy

## Instructions:
1. Fill a large pot with water and bring it to a boil.
2. Meanwhile, prepare the artichokes by trimming off the tough outer leaves and cutting off the top third of each artichoke.
3. Once the water is boiling, add the artichokes to the pot and cook them until they are tender. This usually takes about 30-40 minutes, depending on the size of the artichokes.
4. While the artichokes are cooking, melt the butter in a small saucepan over low heat.
5. Add the chopped parsley to the melted butter and season with salt and white pepper. Stir well to combine.
6. In a separate bowl, whisk together the egg yolks, vinegar, and gravy until well blended.
7. Once the artichokes are cooked, remove them from the pot and drain any excess water.
8. Place the artichokes on a serving platter and drizzle the butter and parsley mixture over them. Toss gently to coat the artichokes.
9. Pour the egg yolk mixture over the artichokes, making sure to evenly distribute the sauce.
10. Serve the artichokes with the white sauce on the side for dipping.

## Cooking time
Approximately 30-40 minutes for boiling the artichokes.
