# Dzel's Wood-cocks

## Description
This recipe provides two options for preparing wood-cocks: as a stew or as a pie. Wood-cocks are cooked with mushrooms, truffles, veal sweetbreads, and bacon, and then served with a thickened sauce. The pie option involves parboiling the wood-cocks, stuffing them with a liver mixture, and baking them in a pastry crust with bacon and veal. Both options result in a flavorful and rich dish.

## Options and commentary
- For the stew option, you can use chicken or game birds as a substitute for wood-cocks.
- The sauce can be thickened with either the entrails of the wood-cocks or a cullis (a rich meat-based sauce).
- You can add a little essence of ham for additional flavor.
- For the pie option, you can use other types of poultry such as turkey, chicken, capon, or pullet.
