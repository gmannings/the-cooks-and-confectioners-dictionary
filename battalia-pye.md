## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 180Â°C.
2. To make the Cruft (Pie Crust):
   1. In a large bowl, combine the flour and butter.
   2. Gradually add boiling water while mixing until a dough forms.
   3. Knead the dough until smooth and elastic.
   4. Divide the dough into two portions, one slightly larger than the other.
   5. Roll out the larger portion to fit the bottom and sides of a pie dish.
   6. Roll out the smaller portion to use as the pie lid. Set aside.
3. To prepare the Filling (Savory Option):
   1. Cut the sweetbreads into walnut-sized pieces.
   2. Parboil the calf's or lamb's tongues, then peel and slice them.
   3. Layer the sweetbreads, lamb bones, sliced tongues, slices of calf's or lamb's head, larded scallops, larks, and oysters in the pie crust.
   4. Season with salt, pepper, mace, and nutmeg.
   5. Add the hard-boiled eggs, marrow, pickled barberries, and sweet butter on top.
4. To prepare the Filling (Sweet Option):
   1. Omit the meatballs and oysters from the filling.
   2. Instead, layer the pie crust with sugar, boiled potatoes, suet, preserved lettuce, and any desired sweetmeats.
5. Cover the pie with the rolled-out pie lid and seal the edges.
6. Bake the pie in the preheated oven for approximately 1 hour or until the crust is golden brown and the filling is cooked through.
7. While the pie is baking, prepare the sauce:
   1. In a saucepan, combine white wine, mace, and sweet butter.
   2. Bring the mixture to a boil and simmer until the sauce thickens slightly.
8. Once the pie is cooked, remove it from the oven and pour the prepared sauce into the pie through a small hole in the lid.
9. Serve the Battalia Pye hot, allowing the sauce to mingle with the flavorful filling.
