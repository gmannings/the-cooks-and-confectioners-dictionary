# Fowled Pike

## Description
Fowled Pike is a dish made from a pike fish that has been boiled in a flavorful broth and served with a garnish of lemon slices and barberries. The fish is cooked until tender and infused with the flavors of white wine, vinegar, ginger, cloves, mace, and lemon peel.

## Ingredients:
- 1 pike fish, cleaned
- Water, enough to cover the fish
- Salt, to taste
- White wine, enough to cover the fish (optional)
- White wine vinegar, 1/4 cup
- Ginger, sliced
- Cloves, whole
- Mace, whole
- Lemon peel
- Lemon slices, for garnish
- Barberries, for garnish

## Instructions:
1. Clean the pike fish by removing the innards and washing it thoroughly to remove any blood and slime.
2. In a large pot, add enough water to cover the fish. If desired, you can substitute some of the water with white wine for added flavor.
3. Bring the water (and wine, if using) to a gentle boil.
4. Once the liquid is boiling, carefully add the pike fish to the pot.
5. Season the liquid with salt, but be careful not to over-season.
6. Add the white wine vinegar, sliced ginger, cloves, and whole mace to the pot.
7. Allow the fish and the broth to simmer gently for a short while.
8. Add a little lemon peel to the pot and continue to simmer until the fish is cooked through. Be careful not to overcook the fish.
9. Once the fish is cooked, carefully transfer it to a serving dish.
10. Pour the broth over the fish, making sure to cover it completely.
11. Cover the dish tightly and let it sit for a while to allow the flavors to meld together.
12. When ready to serve, garnish the fowled pike with slices of lemon and barberries.

## Cooking time
Approximately 30-40 minutes, depending on the size of the pike fish.
