# Noddy Puddings

## Description
Noddy Puddings are a sweet and creamy dessert made with almonds, eggs, sugar, and rosewater. The pudding is boiled in water and served with a sauce made from melted butter, rosewater, and sugar.

## Ingredients:
- 100g blanched almonds
- 1 tablespoon rosewater
- 100ml cream
- 2 eggs
- 50g fine sugar
- For the sauce:
  - 50g butter
  - 1 tablespoon rosewater
  - 50g sugar

## Instructions:
1. In a food processor or using a mortar and pestle, finely grind the blanched almonds.
2. In a small bowl, mix the ground almonds with the rosewater and strain the mixture through a cloth to remove any solids.
3. In a saucepan, heat the cream until it starts to boil. Remove from heat and let it cool until it is almost cold.
4. In a separate bowl, beat the eggs and sweeten them with the fine sugar and rosewater.
5. Gradually add the cooled cream to the egg mixture, stirring continuously.
6. Divide the mixture into small bags and tie them securely.
7. Bring a large pot of water to a boil and carefully place the bags of pudding into the boiling water. Boil for half an hour.
8. While the puddings are boiling, prepare the sauce. In a small saucepan, melt the butter and add the rosewater and sugar. Stir until the sugar has dissolved and the sauce is smooth.
9. Once the puddings are cooked, remove them from the water and carefully open the bags.
10. Serve the noddy puddings hot, drizzled with the melted butter sauce.
