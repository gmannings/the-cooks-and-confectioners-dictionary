# Soals in Fricandeaux

## Description
Soals in Fricandeaux is a classic 18th-century dish made with sole fish. The soles are prepared by removing the heads, tails, and fins, and then larded with small strips of bacon. They are then browned in a pan and simmered in a sauce made with mushrooms or truffles, veal and ham cullis, and essence of ham. The dish is served hot with the soles placed on top of the sauce.

## Ingredients:
- 4 sole fish
- 100g bacon, cut into small strips
- 100g mushrooms or truffles, minced
- 200ml veal and ham cullis
- 1 tablespoon essence of ham
- Juice of 1 lemon
- Salt and pepper to taste

## Instructions:
1. Gut, scrape, wash, and dry the sole fish. Cut off their heads, tails, and fins, and shape them into round pieces.
2. Remove the upper skins of the soles, and lard them with the small strips of bacon. Dust them with flour.
3. Heat a stew-pan over medium heat and add a little melted bacon. Once hot, add the soles one by one and brown them on both sides. Remove the browned soles from the pan.
4. In a separate dish, combine the minced mushrooms or truffles, veal and ham cullis, and essence of ham.
5. Place the browned soles in the dish, with the larded sides facing up. Cover the dish with another dish and simmer it over a gentle fire for a while.
6. Once the soles are cooked through, remove them from the dish. Pour the cullis into the dish you intend to serve in, squeeze in the juice of a lemon, and season with salt and pepper.
7. Place the soles on top of the cullis and serve the dish hot.
