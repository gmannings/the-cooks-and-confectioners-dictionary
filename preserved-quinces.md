# Preserved Quinces

## Description
Preserved quinces are a sweet and tangy fruit preserve made from quinces. The quinces are cooked in a sugar syrup until they are clear and tender, and then combined with quince jelly to enhance the flavor. The preserve is typically served cold and can be enjoyed on its own or used as a topping for desserts.

## Ingredients:
- 4 quinces
- 400g sugar
- 2 cups water
- Quince jelly
- Musk comfit (optional)

## Instructions:
1. Peel and core the quinces. Sprinkle sugar over the quinces as you peel them.
2. Before fully peeling the quinces, fill the core holes with sugar and add a spoonful or two of water to help the sugar melt.
3. Place the quinces in a pot and cover them with water. 
4. Bring the water to a boil and let the quinces boil until they are clear and tender. This should take about 30-40 minutes.
5. While the quinces are boiling, prepare some quince jelly using the cores or pippins.
6. Once the quinces are cooked, remove them from the pot and let them cool slightly.
7. Place the quinces in glass jars or containers.
8. Pour the quince jelly into the syrup that the quinces were boiling in.
9. Boil the jelly and syrup mixture again until it thickens. This should take about 10-15 minutes.
10. Optional: Add a musk comfit to the jelly mixture just before removing it from the heat.
11. Pour the jelly mixture over the quinces in the glass jars.
12. Let the preserved quinces cool completely before sealing the jars and storing them in the refrigerator.
