# Water to Keep the Face from Freckles

## Description
This recipe is for a water that is believed to help prevent freckles on the face. It is made by infusing various flowers, strawberries, and other ingredients in vinegar and wine, and then distilling the mixture. The resulting water is applied to the face, hands, neck, and other areas before bed, and washed off with nenuphar-water in the morning.

## Ingredients:
- 450g bean flowers
- 450g flowers de lis (iris flowers)
- 1.4kg strawberries

2. Add the white wine vinegar, malmsey wine, and Hampshire honey to the container.
3. Stir the mixture well to ensure all the ingredients are combined.
4. Cover the container and let the mixture infuse for a fortnight (two weeks).
5. After the infusion period, set up a sand-bath for distillation. Place the container with the infused mixture on the sand-bath.

7. Once the distillation is complete, let the water cool down.
8. Before going to bed, dip a rag into the distilled water and apply it to the face, hands, neck, and any other desired areas.
9. Leave the water on overnight.
10. In the morning, wash off the water with nenuphar-water.
