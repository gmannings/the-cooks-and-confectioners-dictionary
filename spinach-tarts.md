# Spinach Tarts

## Description
Spinach tarts are a delicious and savory dish made with a combination of spinach, beef marrow, eggs, raisins, currants, orange peel, candied citrons, and a touch of lemon juice. The filling is seasoned with salt, nutmeg, cloves, and mace, and sweetened with sugar. The tarts are then baked or fried to perfection.

## Ingredients:
- 6 handfuls of spinach
- 500g beef marrow
- 12 hard-boiled eggs
- Salt, to taste
- Nutmeg, to taste
- Cloves, to taste
- Mace, to taste
- 400g raisins, stoned
- 400g currants
- Orange peel, finely chopped
- Candied citrons, finely chopped
- Sugar, to taste
- Juice of 1 lemon
- Puff pastry, for the crust

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F).
2. Wash the spinach thoroughly and blanch it in boiling water for a few minutes until wilted. Drain and squeeze out any excess water. Chop the spinach finely.
3. In a large mixing bowl, combine the chopped spinach, beef marrow, and finely chopped hard-boiled eggs.
4. Season the mixture with salt, nutmeg, cloves, and mace. Mix well to evenly distribute the spices.
5. Add the stoned raisins, currants, chopped orange peel, and candied citrons to the mixture. Mix until all the ingredients are well combined.
6. Taste the mixture and adjust the sweetness by adding sugar to your preference.
7. Squeeze in the juice of one lemon to give the filling a pleasing tartness. Mix well.
8. Roll out the puff pastry and cut it into small square pieces.
9. Line small tart tins with the puff pastry squares, making sure to press the pastry into the corners.
10. Fill each tart tin with the spinach and beef marrow mixture, ensuring that each tart is evenly filled.
11. Place the tarts on a baking sheet and bake in the preheated oven for approximately 25-30 minutes, or until the pastry is golden brown and the filling is cooked through.
12. Alternatively, you can fry the tarts in hot oil until they are golden brown and crispy.
13. Once cooked, remove the tarts from the oven or frying pan and allow them to cool slightly before serving.
