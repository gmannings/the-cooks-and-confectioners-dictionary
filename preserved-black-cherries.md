# Preserved Black Cherries

## Description
This recipe is for preserving black cherries in a thick, sweet syrup. The cherries are boiled with sugar until they become thick and pulpy, and then more cherries are added along with additional sugar. The syrup is cooked until it reaches a rope-like consistency, indicating that it is ready.

## Ingredients:
- 1 pound black cherries
- 1/2 pound sugar (plus additional sugar for boiling)

## Instructions:
1. Pull off the stalks from about a pound of black cherries.
2. In a large pot, combine the cherries with enough water to cover them.
3. Add sugar to the pot, using half a pound of sugar for every pound of cherries.
4. Bring the mixture to a boil over medium heat, stirring occasionally to dissolve the sugar.
5. Once the cherries have boiled and the mixture has thickened to a pulpy consistency, it is time to add the remaining cherries.
6. Add the remaining cherries, including the stalks, to the pot.
7. Continue to cook the mixture over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until the sugar has boiled and thickened to a rope-like consistency. This may take some time, so be patient.
8. Once the syrup has reached the desired consistency, remove the pot from the heat and let it cool.
9. Transfer the preserved cherries and syrup to sterilized jars, making sure to leave some headspace at the top.
10. Seal the jars tightly and store them in a cool, dark place.

## Cooking time
Approximately 1-2 hours, depending on the desired consistency of the syrup.
