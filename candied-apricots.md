# Candied Apricots

## Description
Candied apricots are a sweet and fruity treat that make a delicious snack or a beautiful addition to desserts. The apricots are slit and coated with sugar, then baked and dried to create a chewy and sweet candy.

## Ingredients:
- 500g fresh apricots
- 200g fine sugar

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 180째C (350째F).
2. Wash the apricots and pat them dry.
3. Cut a small slit on one side of each apricot, being careful not to cut all the way through. This will allow the sugar to penetrate the fruit.
4. Place the fine sugar in a shallow dish.
5. Dip each apricot into the sugar, making sure to coat both sides. Place the coated apricots in a single layer in a baking dish.
6. Bake the apricots in the preheated oven for about 15-20 minutes, or until the sugar has melted and the apricots are slightly softened.
7. Remove the apricots from the baking dish and transfer them to a wire rack to cool.
8. Once cooled, place the apricots on glass plates or a baking sheet lined with parchment paper.
9. Place the apricots in a low oven (around 50째C or 120째F) for three to four days, or until they are completely dried and chewy. Make sure to turn the apricots occasionally to ensure even drying.

## Cooking time
Approximately 15-20 minutes baking time, followed by 3-4 days of drying.
