# Iced and Preserved Strawberries

## Description
This recipe provides instructions for enjoying strawberries in two different ways: soaked in water or wine and sprinkled with sugar, or preserved as a dry or liquid ice. The choice is yours!

## Options and commentary
- You can choose to soak the strawberries in either water or wine, depending on your preference.
- For the preservation method, you can either keep the strawberries dry or turn them into a liquid ice.

## Ingredients:
- Strawberries
- Water or wine (for soaking)
- Sugar (for sprinkling)
- Optional: additional sugar (for preserving)

## Instructions:
1. Start by washing the strawberries thoroughly and removing any stems or leaves.
2. If you prefer to soak the strawberries, place them in a bowl and cover them with either water or wine. Let them soak for about 10 minutes to enhance their flavor.
3. If you choose to sprinkle the strawberries with sugar, remove them from the soaking liquid and place them on a serving dish. Sprinkle the desired amount of sugar over the strawberries.
4. If you want to preserve the strawberries, remove them from the soaking liquid and place them on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper.
5. If you prefer to preserve the strawberries as a dry ice, sprinkle them with sugar and let them dry completely. This will create a sugary coating around the strawberries, preserving them in a dry form.
6. If you want to preserve the strawberries as a liquid ice, sprinkle them with sugar and let them sit for a few hours until the sugar dissolves and creates a syrup. This syrup will act as a preservative for the strawberries.
7. Once the strawberries are preserved, transfer them to an airtight container or jar for storage.

## Cooking time
- Soaking: 10 minutes
