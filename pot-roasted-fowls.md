# Pot Roasted Fowls

## Description
Pot roasted fowls are seasoned with a blend of spices, then cooked in a pot with melted butter. The fowls are first seasoned and left to marinate for a day, then placed in a pot with cloves and mace, covered with melted butter, and baked in the oven. After baking, the fowls are drained, filled with butter, and placed in another pot with the breasts facing upwards. The gravy from the initial baking is poured over the fowls, along with additional melted butter.

## Ingredients:
- 2 whole fowls
- Salt
- Pepper
- Nutmeg
- Cloves
- Mace
- Butter

## Instructions:
1. Clean the fowls by removing any feathers and innards. Dry them with a cloth, but do not wash them.
2. In a small bowl, mix together salt, pepper, nutmeg, cloves, and mace to create a seasoning blend.
3. Rub the seasoning blend all over the fowls, making sure to coat them evenly. Let the fowls marinate in the seasoning for 24 hours.
4. Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F).
5. Place the fowls in a pot with their breasts facing downwards.
6. Slice some cloves and mace and sprinkle them over the fowls.
7. Melt enough butter to cover the fowls by 1.5 inches and pour it over the fowls in the pot.
8. Cover the pot tightly with a lid or foil.
9. Place the pot in the preheated oven and bake for approximately 1.5 to 2 hours, or until the fowls are cooked through and tender.
10. Remove the pot from the oven and let the fowls stand for a while to drain.
11. Carefully remove the fowls from the pot and set them aside.
12. Fill the bellies of the fowls with butter.
13. Place the fowls in another pot with their breasts facing upwards.
14. Pour off the butter they were baked in, leaving the gravy behind, along with the cloves and mace.
15. Pour the reserved gravy over the fowls in the new pot.
16. Melt enough butter to cover the fowls by 1 inch and pour it over the fowls in the new pot.
17. Cover the pot tightly with a lid or foil.
18. Serve the pot roasted fowls hot, with the melted butter and gravy.
