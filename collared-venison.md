# Collared Venison

## Description
Collared venison is a dish made from a haunch or side of venison that is seasoned, rolled, and cooked slowly in butter. The venison is then preserved in clarified butter, making it a long-lasting and flavorful dish.

## Ingredients:
- 1 haunch or side of venison
- Strips of bacon for larding
- Pepper
- Nutmeg
- Cloves
- Mace
- Salt
- Butter
- Clarified butter

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 150Â°C.
2. Cut the haunch or side of venison into pieces that are suitable for making three collars.
3. Lard the pieces of venison with strips of bacon.
4. In a bowl, mix together pepper, nutmeg, cloves, and mace. Add enough salt to make the spices have a grayish color.
5. Season the larded venison pieces with the spice mixture, ensuring they are evenly coated.
6. Roll up each piece of venison tightly and secure with kitchen twine.
7. Place the rolled venison pieces into an earthen pot.
8. Add a good quantity of butter to the pot, ensuring that the venison is completely covered.
9. Cover the pot with a coarse paste made from flour and water. This will help seal in the moisture during cooking.
10. Place the pot in the preheated oven and bake for five to six hours, or until the venison is tender.
11. Remove the pot from the oven and let it cool to room temperature.
12. Once cooled, take out the venison from the pot and set it aside.
13. Pour away the gravy from the pot and clean it thoroughly.
14. Clarify butter by melting it gently and removing any impurities.
15. Place the clarified butter back into the pot.
16. Lay the venison back into the pot, ensuring it is fully submerged in the clarified butter.
17. Fill the pot with enough clarified butter to cover the venison completely.
18. Seal the pot with a lid or cover it tightly with plastic wrap.
19. Store the collared venison in a cool, dark place. It will keep well for up to a year.
