# Welch Sturgeon

## Description
Welch Sturgeon is a dish made from a leg of beef that is seasoned with various herbs and spices, then baked until tender. The meat is then picked off the bones, shredded, and mixed with beef suet. It is then pounded in a mortar and placed in a venison pot with the fat that came off during baking. The dish is then baked again in a cool oven.
