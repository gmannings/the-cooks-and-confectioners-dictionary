# Ragoo of Lettuce

## Description
A ragoo of lettuce is a dish made with cooked lettuce that is simmered in a flavorful sauce. It can be used as a garnish for dishes or served as a side dish. The lettuce is cooked until tender and then simmered in a veal gravy or a clear cullis with essence of ham.

## Options and commentary
- You can choose to scald the lettuce before cooking it, but it is not necessary.
- Veal gravy can be replaced with vegetable or chicken broth for a lighter flavor.
- Cullis is a rich, thick sauce made from meat stock. You can substitute it with a demi-glace or a thickened broth.
- Essence of ham can be replaced with bacon or pancetta for a similar smoky flavor.
- This dish is traditionally served with a leg of mutton or braised poultry, but it can also be enjoyed as a standalone side dish.

## Ingredients:
- 2 heads of lettuce
- 1 cup veal gravy or vegetable/chicken broth
- 1 cup cullis or demi-glace
- 2 tablespoons essence of ham or bacon/pancetta

## Instructions:
1. If desired, scald the lettuce by placing the heads of lettuce in boiling water for a few seconds, then immediately transferring them to a bowl of cold water. This step helps to remove any bitterness from the lettuce.
2. Squeeze the lettuce heads well to remove excess water, then cut them into small dice.
3. In a saucepan, combine the diced lettuce and veal gravy (or broth). Simmer over medium heat until the lettuce is tender, about 10 minutes.
4. Pour the cullis (or demi-glace) and essence of ham (or bacon/pancetta) over the cooked lettuce. Stir well to combine.
5. Continue to simmer the mixture for another 5 minutes, allowing the flavors to meld together.
6. Remove from heat and serve as a garnish for dishes or as a side dish.

## Cooking time
Approximately 15 minutes.
