## Options and commentary
- Instead of partridges, you can use chicken or turkey as a substitute.
- If you prefer a vegetarian version, you can replace the meat with mushrooms or tofu.
- Adjust the amount of salt and spices according to your taste preferences.

## Ingredients:
- 12 partridges (or chicken/turkey)
- 500ml strong mutton broth (or vegetable broth)
- Salt to taste
- 200g chestnuts, peeled and cooked
- 100g pistachios, shelled
- 1 large onion, finely chopped
- 1 grated nutmeg
- 1 six-penny French loaf (or any crusty bread)
- 200ml mutton gravy (or vegetable gravy)
- Fried oysters (optional)
- Sliced lemon
- Lemon peel
- 2 egg yolks
- 50g butter
- Juice of 1 orange
- Carved lemons and oranges, for garnish

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 180Â°C.
2. Roast the partridges in the preheated oven until cooked through. Set them aside to cool.
3. Once the partridges are cold, mince the meat very finely, including the wings and brawns. Leave the rumps and legs whole.
4. In a saucepan or pot, combine the minced partridge meat, mutton broth (or vegetable broth), salt, chestnuts, pistachios, chopped onion, and grated nutmeg. Cook over medium heat for about 20 minutes, or until the flavors meld together.
5. In another pot, stew the partridge legs and rumps in strong broth for about 15-20 minutes, or until tender.
6. While the partridge meat is cooking, chip the French loaf into small pieces and spread them in the bottom of a serving dish.
7. Pour the mutton gravy (or vegetable gravy) over the bread, allowing it to soak in.
8. Once the partridge meat mixture is cooked, pour it over the bread in the serving dish.
9. Arrange the stewed partridge legs and rumps on top of the meat mixture.
10. If using, add fried oysters, chestnuts, pistachios, sliced lemon, and lemon peel on top.
11. In a separate bowl, whisk together the egg yolks and butter until well combined.
12. Strain the mixture and add the juice of the orange. Stir well.
13. Pour the egg yolk and orange juice mixture over the dish.
14. Garnish the dish with carved lemons and oranges, chestnuts, pistachios, and fried oysters, if desired.
