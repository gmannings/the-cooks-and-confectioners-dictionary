# Apple and Cream Pudding

## Description
This recipe is for a rich and creamy pudding made with apples, cream, eggs, and spices. It is baked in the oven and served with a sprinkle of sugar on top. The combination of flavors and textures makes it a delicious and comforting dessert.

## Ingredients:
- 1 quart (946 ml) cream
- 3-4 blades of mace
- 1-2 cinnamon sticks
- 4 egg whites
- Sugar, to taste
- 6 Pippin apples (or any tart apple variety)
- 1 pint (473 ml) claret (red wine)
- A handful of raisins
- 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
- 1 teaspoon ground ginger
- Sugar, for sprinkling

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 350°F (180°C).

2. In a saucepan, combine the cream, mace, and cinnamon sticks. Bring to a boil over medium heat.

3. In a separate bowl, beat the egg whites until frothy.

4. Once the cream boils, remove it from the heat and gradually add the beaten egg whites, stirring constantly. Return the saucepan to low heat and continue stirring for a few minutes until the mixture thickens slightly.

5. Add sugar to taste, stirring until dissolved.

6. Peel and slice the apples.

7. In a separate saucepan, combine the claret, raisins, ground cinnamon, ground ginger, and sugar. Bring to a boil and then add the sliced apples. Cook until the apples are soft and can be mashed into a puree.

8. Remove the cinnamon sticks from the cream mixture and set aside to cool.

9. Arrange half of the bread slices in a baking dish. Layer half of the cooked apples on top, followed by half of the cream mixture. Repeat the layers with the remaining bread, apples, and cream.

10. Place the baking dish in the preheated oven and bake for about 30-40 minutes, or until the pudding is set and golden on top.

11. Remove from the oven and let it cool slightly.

12. Sprinkle sugar over the top of the pudding.

13. Serve the apple and cream pudding warm or chilled.
