## Description
This recipe is for farced (stuffed) soles, a dish made with fish fillets that are filled with a mixture of herbs and spices. The soles are then cooked on a grill and served with lemon halves. It is a flavorful and aromatic dish that can be enjoyed as a main course.

## Ingredients:
- 4 sole fillets
- 2 tablespoons butter
- 1 tablespoon fresh thyme, minced
- 1 tablespoon fresh savory, minced

- 2 tablespoons melted butter
- 2 tablespoons grated bread

3. In a bowl, combine the minced thyme, savory, basil, parsley, and chives. Season with salt, pepper, nutmeg, and cloves. Mix well.

4. Take each cooled sole fillet and carefully remove the bones from the top of the back, creating a pocket for the stuffing.

5. Stuff each sole fillet with the herb mixture, evenly distributing it among the fillets.

6. Place the stuffed sole fillets on a plate and brush them with melted butter.

7. Sprinkle the grated bread over the top of the stuffed fillets, coating them evenly.
