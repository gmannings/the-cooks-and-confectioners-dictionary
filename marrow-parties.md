# Marrow Parties

## Description
Marrow Parties are a sweet and savory pastry dish made with shredded apples and marrow, encased in puff pastry and fried until golden. They are then sprinkled with sugar for added sweetness. This dish is a delightful combination of flavors and textures.

## Ingredients:
- 2 apples
- 100g marrow (alternatively, you can use butter or vegetable shortening)
- 2 tablespoons sugar
- Puff pastry sheets
- Fresh butter, for frying
- Additional sugar, for sprinkling

## Instructions:
1. Peel and core the apples. Shred them using a grater or food processor.
2. In a mixing bowl, combine the shredded apples and marrow. If you're using butter or vegetable shortening instead of marrow, melt it and mix it with the shredded apples.
3. Add 2 tablespoons of sugar to the apple and marrow mixture. Mix well to combine.
4. Roll out the puff pastry sheets on a lightly floured surface. Cut them into small squares or circles, depending on your preference.
5. Place a spoonful of the apple and marrow mixture onto each pastry square or circle.
6. Fold the pastry over the filling to create a pocket. Press the edges together to seal.
7. Heat a frying pan over medium heat and add enough fresh butter to cover the bottom of the pan.
8. Carefully place the filled pastries into the hot butter and fry them until golden brown on both sides. This should take about 2-3 minutes per side.
9. Once the pastries are fried, remove them from the pan and place them on a paper towel-lined plate to drain excess oil.
10. Sprinkle the fried pastries with additional sugar while they are still warm.
11. Serve the Marrow Parties warm as a delicious sweet and savory treat.
