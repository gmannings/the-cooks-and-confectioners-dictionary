# Boiled Pig

## Description
This recipe is for boiling a whole pig, resulting in tender and flavorful meat. The pig is seasoned with herbs and spices, then stewed with prunes, currants, and mace. The dish is served with sippets (small pieces of toasted bread) and the cooking liquid poured over the pig.

## Ingredients:
- 1 young pig
- Water
- Salt
- 1 bunch of sweet marjoram
- Winter savory
- Thyme
- Rosemary

- Currants
- Large mace
- Sippets (small pieces of toasted bread)

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F).
2. Place the young pig in a large pot and fill it with enough water to cover the pig.
3. Add a handful of salt to the pot.
4. Tie the bunch of sweet marjoram, winter savory, thyme, and rosemary together with kitchen twine and add it to the pot.
5. Bring the water to a boil over high heat, then reduce the heat to low and simmer the pig for about 2 hours, or until it is halfway cooked.
6. Carefully remove the pig from the pot and place it on a cutting board.
7. Use a sharp knife to remove the skin from the pig.
8. Cut the pig into quarters.
