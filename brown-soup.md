# Brown Soup

## Description
Brown Soup is a hearty and flavorful dish made with a rich broth, tender beef, and a variety of vegetables and herbs. It is a traditional 18th-century recipe that has been modernized for today's home cooks.

## Options and commentary
- You can customize the vegetables and herbs used in the soup based on your preferences and what you have on hand.
- If you prefer a vegetarian version, you can omit the beef and use vegetable broth instead.
- The cooking time may vary depending on the tenderness of the beef and the desired consistency of the soup.

## Ingredients:
- Herbs (such as thyme, rosemary, and parsley)
- 1 teaspoon whole black peppercorns
- 6 whole cloves
- 3-4 blades of mace
- Water
- 3-4 pounds beef (such as chuck or stewing beef), cut into steaks
- Flour, for coating the beef
- Butter
- 2 ducks, half roasted (optional)
- Handful of spinach, roughly chopped
- Handful of sorrel, roughly chopped
- Ox palates (optional)
- Sweetbreads, pulled into pieces (optional)
- Cockscombs (optional)
- Mushrooms (optional)
- Bread, fried until crisp

## Instructions:
1. In a large pot, combine the herbs, black peppercorns, cloves, and mace. Add enough water to cover the ingredients.
2. Bring the mixture to a gentle boil and let it simmer until the flavors have infused into the broth, about 30 minutes.
3. Strain the broth to remove the herbs and spices. Set aside.
4. In a separate bowl, season the beef steaks with salt and pepper.
5. Coat the beef steaks in flour, shaking off any excess.
6. In a large skillet, melt butter over medium heat. Add the beef steaks and cook until browned on both sides, ensuring the butter boils up before adding the beef.
7. Once the beef is browned, pour in the strained broth from step 3.
8. If using, place the half-roasted ducks in the middle of the soup dish.
9. Add the chopped spinach and sorrel to the pot.
10. If using, add ox palates, sweetbreads, cockscombs, and mushrooms to the pot.
11. Stir all the ingredients together and let the soup simmer until the beef is tender and the flavors have melded, about 1-2 hours.
12. In a separate pan, fry bread until crisp.
13. Just before serving, stir the fried bread into the soup.
14. Serve the brown soup hot, garnished with additional herbs if desired.

## Cooking time
