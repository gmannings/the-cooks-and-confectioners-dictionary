# Ratafia

## Description
Ratafia is a traditional liqueur made from brandy, white wine, and various flavorings. It has a sweet and aromatic taste, making it a popular choice for after-dinner drinks or as a base for cocktails.

## Options and commentary
- You can use any brandy of your choice, but a good quality brandy will enhance the flavor of the ratafia.
- French white wine can be substituted with any dry white wine.
- Orange-flower water can be found in specialty stores or online. If you can't find it, you can substitute with orange zest or orange extract.
- Apricock stones are the pits of apricots. If you can't find them, you can use almond extract or crushed almonds as a substitute.
- The recipe calls for a large bottle, but you can adjust the quantities to fit the size of your container.
