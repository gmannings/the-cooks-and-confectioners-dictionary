# Red Trilp'd Almonds

## Description
Red Trilp'd Almonds are a sweet and crunchy treat made with almonds and a red sugar coating. The almonds are coated in a crackled sugar mixture that has been colored with cochineal, a natural red dye. These almonds make a great snack or a festive addition to any dessert table.

## Ingredients:
- 200g almonds
- 200g sugar
- Cochineal (natural red dye)
- Alum
- Cream of tartar

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F).
2. Place the almonds on a baking sheet and toast them in the preheated oven for about 10 minutes, or until they are golden brown. Remove from the oven and set aside.
3. In a medium-sized saucepan, combine the sugar with a small amount of water. Cook over medium heat, stirring constantly, until the sugar has dissolved and the mixture starts to boil.
4. Add a small amount of cochineal to the sugar mixture and continue to cook until the sugar reaches the crackled stage. This is when the sugar forms hard, crackled pieces when dropped into cold water.
5. In a separate pot, boil the alum and cream of tartar together. This will be used to prepare the cochineal.
6. Strain the cochineal mixture into the sugar mixture and stir well to combine. The sugar mixture should turn a vibrant red color.
7. Add the toasted almonds to the sugar mixture and stir continuously to coat the almonds evenly. Keep stirring until the sugar starts to harden and form a coating around the almonds.
8. Once the almonds are well coated, remove them from the heat and spread them out on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Allow them to cool completely before serving.
