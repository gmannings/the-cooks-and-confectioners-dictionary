# Syrup of Rose

## Description
Syrup of Rose is a sweet and fragrant syrup made from rose petals. It can be used as a flavoring in various desserts, beverages, or even as a topping for pancakes or waffles.

## Ingredients:
- 1.4 kg rose petals (Damask Rose variety)
- 4 liters warm water
- 1.8 kg fine sugar

## Instructions:
1. In a large, well-glazed earthen pot with a narrow mouth, combine the rose petals and warm water.
2. Cover the pot tightly to prevent the escape of the aromatic properties of the rose petals.
3. Allow the rose petals to infuse in the warm water for 8 hours.
4. After 8 hours, heat the water again to warm it up.
5. Squeeze out the infused rose petals to extract as much flavor as possible.
6. Add another 1.4 kg of rose petals to the pot and infuse them in the warm water for another 8 hours.
7. After 8 hours, squeeze out the second batch of rose petals, pressing them firmly to extract all the flavor.
8. Measure the infused liquid. For every liter of liquid, add 1.8 kg of fine sugar.
9. Transfer the infused liquid and sugar mixture to a large pot and bring it to a boil.
10. Boil the mixture until it reaches a syrup consistency, with a thick and sticky texture.
11. Remove the pot from the heat and let the syrup cool down.
12. Once cooled, strain the syrup to remove any impurities or remaining rose petals.
13. Transfer the syrup to clean, sterilized bottles or jars for storage.

## Cooking time
Approximately 16 hours (8 hours for each infusion) + boiling and cooling time.
