# Crispy Pancakes

## Description
These crispy pancakes are made in a small frying pan and then boiled in lard to achieve a golden color and a crispy texture. They make a delicious and satisfying breakfast or snack.

## Ingredients:
- 1 cup all-purpose flour (125g)
- 1 teaspoon baking powder
- 1/4 teaspoon salt
- 1 tablespoon sugar
- 1 cup milk (240ml)
- 1 large egg
- Lard or vegetable oil, for frying

## Instructions:
1. In a mixing bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, salt, and sugar.
2. In a separate bowl, beat the egg and then add the milk. Whisk until well combined.
3. Gradually pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients, whisking continuously until a smooth batter forms.
4. Heat a small frying pan over medium heat and add a small amount of lard or vegetable oil to coat the bottom of the pan.
5. Pour a small amount of batter into the pan, using approximately 1/4 cup for each pancake. Tilt the pan to spread the batter evenly.
6. Cook the pancake until bubbles form on the surface and the edges start to look set, about 2-3 minutes.
7. Flip the pancake and cook for an additional 1-2 minutes, or until golden brown.
8. Remove the pancake from the pan and place it on a paper towel-lined plate to absorb any excess oil.
9. Repeat steps 5-8 with the remaining batter, adding more lard or oil to the pan as needed.
10. Serve the crispy pancakes warm with your favorite toppings, such as maple syrup, fresh fruit, or whipped cream.
