# Pickled Barberries

## Description
Pickled barberries are a tangy and flavorful condiment that can be used to add a burst of acidity to various dishes. They are made by briefly blanching the barberries and then pickling them in a mixture of white wine and vinegar.

## Ingredients:
- 250g barberries
- 250ml white wine
- 250ml vinegar (white or apple cider)
- 1 teaspoon salt

## Instructions:
1. Pick the barberries from the leaves, ensuring they are ripe and free from any debris.
2. Bring a pot of water to a boil and add the barberries. Let them boil for about 2 minutes.
3. Drain the barberries and transfer them to sterilized glass jars or gallipots.
4. In a small saucepan, combine the white wine, vinegar, and salt. Heat the mixture over low heat until warm, but not boiling.
5. Pour the warm pickling liquid over the barberries, ensuring they are completely submerged.
6. Seal the jars tightly and let them cool to room temperature.
7. Once cooled, store the pickled barberries in the refrigerator for at least 24 hours before using. They can be kept for several weeks.

## Cooking time
Approximately 30 minutes (including pickling time)
