# Sprup of Lemons

## Description
Sprup of Lemons is a refreshing and tangy citrus drink made from sliced lemons and sugar. It is a simple and easy-to-make beverage that can be enjoyed on its own or used as a base for cocktails.

## Ingredients:
- 4 lemons
- 1 cup sugar

## Instructions:
1. Wash the lemons thoroughly to remove any dirt or residue.
2. Using a sharp knife or a vegetable peeler, carefully remove the outer yellow zest of the lemons, avoiding the white pith.
3. Slice the lemons thinly, discarding the ends.
4. In a glass or ceramic bowl, layer a thin layer of sugar at the bottom.
5. Arrange a layer of lemon slices on top of the sugar.
6. Repeat the layering process, alternating between sugar and lemon slices, until all the lemons and sugar are used.
7. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap or a lid and let it stand overnight at room temperature. This will allow the sugar to dissolve and the flavors to meld together.
8. The next day, strain the juice that has accumulated in the bowl through a fine-mesh strainer or a cheesecloth-lined strainer to remove any pulp or seeds.
9. Transfer the strained juice into glass bottles or jars for storage.
10. Refrigerate the sprup of lemons until chilled before serving.
