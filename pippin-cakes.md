# Pippin Cakes

## Description
Pippin cakes are a sweet treat made from boiled and sieved apples, flavored with lemon peel and sugar. They are then dried in the oven and cut into various shapes. These cakes have a soft and chewy texture with a hint of tartness from the lemon.

## Options and commentary
