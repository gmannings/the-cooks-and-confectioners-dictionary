# Marinated and Fried Salmon

## Description
This recipe is for marinated and fried salmon slices. The salmon is first marinated in a flavorful mixture of spices, herbs, and lemon juice (or vinegar). It is then coated in flour and fried until golden brown. The fried salmon slices are served on a clean napkin and garnished with fried parsley.

## Ingredients:
- 1 salmon fillet
- Salt
- Pepper
- 6 cloves
- 1 onion, sliced
- A handful of chives
- A small bunch of sweet basil
- A small bunch of parsley
- 1 bay leaf
- 3-4 lemons (or vinegar)

## Instructions:
1. Cut the salmon fillet into slices. Remove the skin and the middle bone from each slice.
2. Place the salmon slices in a saucepan.
3. Season the salmon slices with salt, pepper, cloves, sliced onion, chives, sweet basil, parsley, and bay leaf.
4. Squeeze the juice of 3-4 lemons over the salmon slices. Alternatively, you can use vinegar instead of lemon juice.
5. Let the salmon marinate in this mixture (marinade) for two hours.
6. After marinating, remove the salmon slices from the marinade and pat them dry with a cloth.
7. Coat the salmon slices with flour, ensuring they are evenly coated.
