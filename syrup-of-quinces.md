# Syrup of Quinces

## Description
This recipe is for making a sweet syrup using quinces. The quinces are grated and their pulp is extracted to obtain the juice. The juice is then clarified and combined with sugar to create a flavorful syrup. The syrup can be used as a sweetener or flavoring in various dishes and beverages.

## Ingredients:
- 4 quinces
- 1 pound (450 grams) sugar

## Instructions:
1. Grate the quinces using a grater or food processor.
2. Place the grated quinces in a cloth and squeeze to extract the juice. Discard the pulp.
3. Set the quince juice in the sun or near a warm fire to allow it to settle and clarify. Alternatively, you can let it sit undisturbed for a few hours.
4. In a separate pot, boil the sugar with a little water until it reaches the "blown" stage. This is when the sugar has reached a high temperature and forms a thin thread when dropped into cold water.
5. If adding the quince juice to the boiling sugar causes the temperature to drop too much, continue boiling the syrup until it becomes slightly thickened and has a pearly appearance.
6. Remove the syrup from the heat and let it cool.
7. Once the syrup is cold, transfer it to bottles for storage.

## Cooking time
Approximately 1-2 hours, depending on the time needed for the quince juice to settle and the sugar to reach the desired stage.
