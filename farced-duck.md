# Farced Duck

## Description
This recipe involves stuffing the breast of a duck with a mixture of capon breast, minced beef marrow, and seasoned raw egg yolks. The duck is then braised and served with a ragout made from sweetbreads, fat livers, cockscombs, truffles, mushrooms, artichoke bottoms, and asparagus tops. The ragout is cooked in melted bacon and moistened with gravy, thickened with a veal and ham sauce. This dish is rich and flavorful, perfect for a special occasion.

## Options and commentary
- Instead of capon breast, you can use chicken breast as a substitute.
- If beef marrow is not available, you can use butter or a combination of butter and bacon fat for richness.
- The ragout ingredients can be adjusted based on personal preference and availability. You can add or omit ingredients as desired.
- Serve the farced duck with roasted potatoes or a side of vegetables for a complete meal.

## Ingredients:
- 1 duck
- 1 capon breast or chicken breast
- 100g beef marrow or butter
- 2 raw egg yolks
- Salt and pepper to taste
- A pinch of nutmeg
- Sweetbreads of veal or lamb
- Fat livers
- Cockscombs
- Truffles
- Mushrooms
- Artichoke bottoms
- Asparagus tops
- Bacon
- Gravy
- Veal and ham sauce (cullis)

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 180째C (350째F).
2. In a bowl, combine the minced capon breast or chicken breast, minced beef marrow or butter, raw egg yolks, salt, pepper, and nutmeg. Mix well to form a stuffing mixture.
3. Carefully remove the skin from the breast of the duck, keeping it intact. Stuff the breast with the prepared stuffing mixture, ensuring it is evenly distributed.
4. Heat a large, oven-safe skillet or Dutch oven over medium heat. Place the stuffed duck breast, skin-side down, in the skillet and cook until the skin is browned and crispy, about 5 minutes.
5. Flip the duck breast over and transfer the skillet to the preheated oven. Roast the duck for about 25-30 minutes, or until the internal temperature reaches 65째C (150째F) for medium doneness.
6. While the duck is roasting, prepare the ragout. In a separate skillet, cook the sweetbreads, fat livers, cockscombs, truffles, mushrooms, artichoke bottoms, and asparagus tops in melted bacon until they are cooked through and tender.
7. Once the ragout ingredients are cooked, pour in some gravy and thicken the mixture with the veal and ham sauce (cullis). Stir well to combine and let it simmer for a few minutes.
8. Remove the roasted duck from the oven and let it rest for a few minutes before slicing.
9. To serve, place the sliced duck on a platter and pour the prepared ragout over it.
10. Serve the farced duck with roasted potatoes or a side of vegetables.
