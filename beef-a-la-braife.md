## Instructions:
1. Remove the fat from the beef ribs and lard them with slices of bacon seasoned with spices, herbs, mushrooms, and truffles.
2. Tie the beef ribs with kitchen twine to keep them intact during cooking.
3. Line the bottom of a stewpan with thin slices of fat bacon, then layer slices of lean beef on top, seasoned with spices, herbs, onions, lemon peel, salt, and pepper.
4. Place the beef ribs in the stewpan, fleshy side downwards, and season the top with the same spices and herbs.
5. Layer more slices of beef and bacon on top.
6. Cover the stewpan and seal it with pastry dough to prevent steam from escaping.
7. Cook the beef in the stewpan over low heat, both on the stovetop and in the oven, until it is tender and cooked through.
8. While the beef is cooking, prepare the sauce or ragout.

For the sauce:
1. In a separate pan, sauté the diced gammon of bacon, mushrooms, young onions, and parsley in lard or cooking fat.
2. Moisten the mixture with gravy and thicken it with cullis made from veal and bacon.
3. Pour the sauce over the cooked beef before serving.

For the ragout:
1. If using cardoons, succory, celery, or roasted onions, prepare them according to your preferred method.
2. For the cucumber ragout, marinate the cucumber slices and onions in vinegar, salt, and pepper for two hours.
3. Squeeze the excess liquid from the cucumbers and sauté them in melted bacon until browned.
4. Add gravy and simmer the cucumbers until tender.
5. Thicken the sauce with cullis made from veal and bacon.
6. Pour the ragout over the cooked beef before serving.

## Cooking time
- The beef will need to be slow-cooked for several hours until tender.
- The sauce or ragout can be prepared while the beef is cooking, and it will take approximately 30 minutes to prepare.
