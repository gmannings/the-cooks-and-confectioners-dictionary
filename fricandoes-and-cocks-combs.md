# Fricandoes and Cocks-combs

## Description
Fricandoes and cockscombs were popular dishes in the 18th century. Fricandoes are thin slices of meat, usually beef or veal, that are braised until tender. Cockscombs are the red, fleshy crests on top of a rooster's head. They are considered a delicacy and are often used to garnish dishes. In this recipe, the fricandoes and cockscombs are used to create a ring or border around the dish, adding both flavor and visual appeal.

## Options and commentary
- Instead of beef or veal, you can use chicken or turkey breast for the fricandoes.
- If cockscombs are not available, you can omit them or use another garnish of your choice.
- This recipe can be served as a main dish or as a fancy appetizer.

## Ingredients:
- 500g beef or veal, thinly sliced (or chicken/turkey breast)
- 12 cockscombs (optional)
- 2 tablespoons butter

- 2 cloves of garlic, minced
- 250ml beef or chicken broth
- 250ml dry white wine
- 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
- Salt and pepper to taste

## Instructions:
1. If using cockscombs, blanch them in boiling water for 5 minutes. Remove and set aside.
2. In a large skillet, melt the butter over medium heat.
3. Add the chopped onion and minced garlic to the skillet and saut√© until translucent.

6. Slowly pour in the beef or chicken broth and white wine, stirring to combine and create a smooth sauce.
7. Return the meat to the skillet and season with salt and pepper. Cover and simmer for 1 hour, or until the meat is tender.
