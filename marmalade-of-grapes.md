# Marmalade of Grapes

## Description
Marmalade of Grapes is a sweet and tangy spread made from grapes and raisins. It can be enjoyed on toast, scones, or used as a filling for pastries.

## Options and commentary
- You can use either white or red grapes for this recipe, depending on your preference.
- Make sure to choose grapes that are dry and not overly ripe.
- Sugar or fine sugar-candy can be used to sweeten the marmalade.

## Ingredients:
- 500g grapes (white or red)
- 500g raisins
- Water
- Sugar or fine sugar-candy (to taste)

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to a low temperature (around 120Â°C).
2. Spread the grapes on a baking sheet and place them in the oven to dry for about 2-3 hours. The grapes should become slightly wrinkled and dry, but not overly browned.
3. Remove the grapes from the oven and let them cool completely.
4. Once cooled, remove the stems from the grapes and place them in a large pot.
5. Add the raisins to the pot with the grapes.
6. Pour enough water into the pot to cover the grapes and raisins.
7. Bring the mixture to a boil over medium heat, skimming off any foam that forms on the surface.
8. Reduce the heat to low and simmer the mixture, stirring occasionally, until the water has boiled away by two-thirds. This may take several hours.
9. Once the mixture has thickened, remove it from the heat and let it cool slightly.
10. Pass the mixture through a sieve to remove any seeds or skins from the grapes and raisins.
11. Return the strained mixture to the pot and bring it to a boil again.
12. Add sugar or fine sugar-candy to taste, stirring until it is fully dissolved.
13. Remove the pot from the heat and let the marmalade cool.
14. Transfer the marmalade into clean, sterilized jars and seal them tightly.
15. Store the jars in a cool, dark place for future use.

## Cooking time
- Drying the grapes: 2-3 hours
