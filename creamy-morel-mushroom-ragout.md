## Ingredients:

- Salt and pepper to taste
- 1 tablespoon chopped parsley
- 1 faggot of savory herbs (such as thyme, rosemary, and bay leaf)
- 1 cup fish broth (or vegetable broth or chicken broth)
- 2 egg yolks
- 1/4 cup cream

## Instructions:
1. If using dried morel mushrooms, rehydrate them in warm water according to the package instructions. Drain and set aside.
2. If using fresh morel mushrooms, pick off the stalks and cut them in half. Wash them well in several changes of water to remove any dirt or debris. Drain and set aside.
3. In a saucepan, melt the butter over medium heat. Add the morel mushrooms and saut√© for 2-3 minutes until they start to soften.
4. Season the mushrooms with salt, pepper, and chopped parsley. Add the faggot of savory herbs.
5. Pour in the fish broth to moisten the mushrooms. Reduce the heat to low and let the ragout simmer gently for about 10 minutes, allowing the flavors to meld together.
6. In a small bowl, beat the egg yolks with the cream until well combined.
7. Slowly pour the egg yolk mixture into the saucepan with the mushrooms, stirring continuously to prevent curdling. Cook for an additional 2-3 minutes until the ragout thickens.
