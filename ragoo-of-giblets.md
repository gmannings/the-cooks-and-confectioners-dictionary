# Ragoo of Giblets

## Description
Ragoo of Giblets is a rich and flavorful dish made with giblets (such as liver, heart, and gizzard) and cockscombs. The giblets are first scalded and then simmered in a strong broth with salt, spices, and herbs. They are then sautéed in melted bacon with chives and parsley. Finally, the giblets are returned to their broth, thickened with egg yolks, and served in plates.

## Ingredients:
- Giblets (such as liver, heart, and gizzard)
- Cockscombs (optional)
- Strong broth
- Salt
- Spice (such as pepper, cloves, or nutmeg)
- Fresh herbs (such as thyme, rosemary, or parsley)
- Bacon
- Chives
- Eggs

## Instructions:
1. Scald the giblets by placing them in a pot of boiling water for a few minutes. This will help remove any impurities. If using cockscombs, scald them separately and remove the skin.
2. In a pan, combine the scalded giblets (and cockscombs, if using) with the strong broth. Season generously with salt, spice, and fresh herbs.
3. Simmer the giblets and cockscombs in the broth for about 30 minutes, or until they are cooked through and tender.
4. Remove the giblets and cockscombs from the broth and set them aside.
5. In a separate pan, melt the bacon over medium heat. Add the chopped chives and finely chopped parsley. Sauté until the bacon is crispy and the herbs are fragrant.
6. Add the cooked giblets and cockscombs to the pan with the bacon, chives, and parsley. Stir everything together to coat the giblets and cockscombs with the flavorful mixture.
7. Return the giblets and cockscombs to their own broth and simmer for an additional 10 minutes to allow the flavors to meld together.
8. In a small bowl, whisk the egg yolks until smooth. Gradually add some of the hot broth to the egg yolks, whisking constantly. This will temper the yolks and prevent them from curdling when added to the hot broth.
9. Slowly pour the tempered egg yolks into the pan with the giblets and cockscombs, stirring constantly. Continue to cook over low heat until the sauce thickens slightly.
10. Serve the Ragoo of Giblets in plates, spooning the flavorful broth over the giblets and cockscombs.
