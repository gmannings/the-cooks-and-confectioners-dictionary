# Boiled Leg of Veal and Bacon with Green Sauce

## Description
This recipe is for a traditional boiled leg of veal and bacon dish, served with a tangy green sauce. The leg of veal is larded with bacon and lemon peel, then boiled with a piece of bacon. The cooked bacon is sliced and seasoned with sage and pepper. The veal is then plated, surrounded by the sliced bacon, and garnished with parsley. The dish is served with a green sauce made from sorrel, vinegar, sugar, and optionally, pippins (apples).

## Options and commentary
- Instead of larding the veal with bacon, you can use thin strips of bacon to wrap around the veal.
- If sorrel is not available, you can use spinach or watercress as a substitute for the green sauce.
- The green sauce can be served on the side or poured over the veal and bacon.

## Ingredients:
- 1 leg of veal (approximately 2 kg)
- 200g bacon, sliced into lardons or thin strips
- Zest of 1 lemon
- 1 piece of middling bacon (about 200g)
- 1 tablespoon dried sage
- 1 teaspoon black pepper
- Fresh parsley, chopped, for garnish
- For the green sauce:
  - 2-3 handfuls of sorrel (or substitute spinach or watercress)
  - 2 pippins (apples), quartered (optional)
  - 2 tablespoons vinegar
  - 1 tablespoon sugar
  - Grated nutmeg, to taste
  - 1 tablespoon butter

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F).
2. Lard the leg of veal by inserting the bacon lardons or strips and lemon zest into the meat, evenly distributed all over the surface.
3. Place the larded veal and the piece of middling bacon in a large pot or Dutch oven. Add enough water to cover the meat.
4. Bring the water to a boil over high heat, then reduce the heat to low and simmer for about 2 hours, or until the veal is cooked through and tender.
5. While the veal is boiling, prepare the green sauce:
   - Option 1: In a mortar, pound the sorrel (or substitute) with the quartered pippins until well mashed. Add vinegar and sugar, and mix well.
   - Option 2: Pound the sorrel (or substitute) in a mortar, squeeze out the juice, and transfer it to a small saucepan. Add butter, sugar, and grated nutmeg. Warm the sauce over low heat, stirring until well combined.
6. Once the bacon in the pot is cooked, remove it from the pot and slice it into thin strips. Season the bacon slices with dried sage and black pepper, mixing them together.
7. Remove the cooked veal from the pot and place it on a serving platter. Surround the veal with the sliced bacon.
8. Sprinkle the dish with freshly chopped parsley.
9. Serve the boiled leg of veal and bacon with the green sauce in saucers on the side, or pour the green sauce over the veal and bacon before serving.

## Cooking time
Approximately 2 hours for boiling the veal.
