# Roasted Beef with Cucumbers

## Description
This dish features tender beef that is roasted and served with marinated cucumbers. The beef is larded or covered with bacon slices to add flavor and moisture. The cucumbers are sliced, marinated, and then stewed with lard before being thickened with flour and gravy. The dish is garnished with fried bread, marinades, or rissoles.

## Options and commentary
- You can use a tender cut of beef such as sirloin or tenderloin for this recipe.
- Instead of larding the beef, you can wrap it in thin slices of bacon to add flavor and moisture.
- For the marinade, you can use a mixture of vinegar, oil, herbs, and spices to add flavor to the cucumbers.
- If you don't have gammon essence, you can omit it or use a small amount of bacon or ham for added flavor.
- The garnish can be customized based on your preference. You can use fried bread, marinades (pickled vegetables), or rissoles (small fried pastries).

## Ingredients:
- 1 kg beef (tender cut such as sirloin or tenderloin)
- 8-10 slices of bacon
- 4 cucumbers
- 2 tablespoons lard
- 2 tablespoons flour
- 500 ml beef gravy
- 1 tablespoon gammon essence (optional)
- 2 tablespoons verjuice or vinegar
- Salt and pepper to taste
- Fried bread, marinades, or rissoles for garnish

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 180Â°C.
2. Lard the beef by inserting small strips of bacon into the meat using a larding needle. Alternatively, wrap the beef with bacon slices and secure with kitchen twine.
3. Place the larded or bacon-wrapped beef on a roasting rack in a roasting pan. Roast in the preheated oven for about 25-30 minutes per 500g of beef, or until the desired level of doneness is reached.
4. While the beef is roasting, prepare the cucumbers. Slice the cucumbers into thin rounds.
5. In a bowl, combine the sliced cucumbers with a marinade of your choice (vinegar, oil, herbs, and spices). Let the cucumbers marinate for about 15-20 minutes.
6. Squeeze the marinated cucumbers to remove excess liquid.
7. In a stew-pan, heat the lard over medium heat. Add the squeezed cucumbers and stew them for about 10 minutes, until they are softened.
8. Drain off the excess lard from the stewed cucumbers. Add the flour to the pan and toss the cucumbers to coat them with the flour.
9. Pour in the beef gravy and stir well to incorporate the flour. Add the gammon essence (if using) and verjuice or vinegar. Season with salt and pepper to taste.
10. Let the cucumbers simmer in the gravy for a few minutes until the sauce thickens slightly.
11. Remove the roasted beef from the oven and let it rest for a few minutes. Cut the beef into thin slices or filets.
12. Arrange the beef slices on a serving dish. Pour the cucumber and gravy mixture over the beef.
13. Garnish with fried bread, marinades, or rissoles.
14. Serve the dish hot.
