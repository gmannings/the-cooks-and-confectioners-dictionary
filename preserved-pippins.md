# Preserved Pippins

## Description
Preserved Pippins are a sweet and tangy apple preserve that can be enjoyed on their own or used as a topping for desserts. This recipe involves boiling the apples in water and sugar to create a syrup that coats the tender apple quarters.

## Ingredients:
- 4 Pippin apples
- Water
- Sugar
- Lemon juice

## Instructions:
1. Peel, quarter, and core the Pippin apples.
2. Place the apple quarters in a pot and cover them with water. Add some of the apple parings and parings from other apples for added flavor.
3. Boil the apples in the water until they are tender.
4. Drain the water from the apples using a clean cloth.
5. Measure the amount of water drained from the apples and transfer it to a saucepan.
6. Add double-refined sugar to the saucepan, using as much as you prefer according to the proportion of your apples.
7. Place the saucepan with the water and sugar mixture over a low heat source, such as a charcoal fire.
8. Add the quartered Pippins to the saucepan and let them boil gently until they are very tender. Stir them gently with a spoon occasionally, being careful not to break them.
9. Remove the cooked Pippins from the saucepan and place them on the brims of a pewter dish to drain any excess syrup.
10. Continue boiling the syrup in the saucepan over a high heat, adding more sugar and the juice of a lemon.
11. Once the syrup has reached the desired consistency, remove it from the heat.
12. Arrange the quartered Pippins on serving dishes and pour the syrup over them.
