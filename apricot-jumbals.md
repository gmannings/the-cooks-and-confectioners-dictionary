# Apricot Jumbals

## Description
Apricot jumbals are a type of sweet treat made from apricots. The apricots are scalded until tender, then the pulp is dried and turned into a stiff paste with sugar. The paste is then flavored and shaped into knots before being dried for future use.

## Ingredients:
- 500g apricots
- 200g fine sugar
- Cochineal or saunders (for coloring)

## Instructions:
1. Scald the apricots by placing them in boiling water for a few minutes until they become tender.
2. Remove the apricots from the boiling water and allow them to cool.
3. Once cooled, remove the skins and pits from the apricots.
4. Place the apricot pulp in a dish and dry it in a low oven or over a chafing dish of coals until it becomes dry and crumbly.
5. Transfer the dried apricot pulp to a stone mortar and pound it until it becomes a fine powder.
6. Add the fine sugar to the powdered apricot pulp and mix well until it forms a stiff paste.
7. If desired, add cochineal or saunders to the paste to give it a vibrant color. Mix well to evenly distribute the color.
8. Take small portions of the paste and roll them into long ropes.
9. Tie the ropes into knots and place them on a drying rack or tray.
10. Allow the jumbals to dry for a day or two until they become firm and dry to the touch.
11. Once dried, the apricot jumbals are ready to be enjoyed.

## Cooking time
Approximately 2 days for drying the apricot pulp and jumbals.
