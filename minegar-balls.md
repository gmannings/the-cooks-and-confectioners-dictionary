# Minegar Balls

## Description
Minegar Balls are small balls made from dried and powdered brambleberries, mixed with white wine vinegar. They are stored in boxes and can be dissolved in wine, stale beer, or water when needed. They add a tangy and fruity flavor to beverages.

## Ingredients:
- Brambleberries (half ripe)
- White wine vinegar

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to a low temperature (around 50Â°C) or use a food dehydrator.
2. Wash the brambleberries and remove any stems or leaves.
3. Spread the brambleberries on a baking sheet or dehydrator tray in a single layer.
4. Place the baking sheet or tray in the oven or dehydrator and dry the berries until they are half ripe and slightly shriveled. This may take several hours, depending on the temperature and moisture content of the berries.
5. Once the berries are dried, remove them from the oven or dehydrator and let them cool completely.
6. Grind the dried brambleberries into a fine powder using a spice grinder or mortar and pestle.
7. In a bowl, combine the powdered brambleberries with white wine vinegar. The ratio should be approximately 1 part vinegar to 3 parts powdered berries, but you can adjust the ratio to taste.
8. Mix the ingredients together until they form a thick paste.
9. Take small portions of the paste and roll them into balls, approximately the size of nuts.
10. Place the Minegar balls in airtight boxes or containers for storage. Make sure to label them for future use.
11. When you want to use the Minegar balls, dissolve one or two of them in wine, stale beer, or water. Adjust the amount according to your taste preferences.
