# Blanc-Manger

## Description
Blanc-Manger is a traditional French dessert made with a creamy almond base. This recipe adds a twist by incorporating minced capon for added flavor and texture. The dish is thickened to a pap-like consistency and can be served in various forms or fashions.

## Ingredients:
- 250g all-purpose flour
- 115g butter
- 4 egg yolks
- 8 egg yolks
- 225g almonds
- 1 cooked capon (boiled or roasted)
- 60ml rose water
- 60ml cream
- 4 egg whites
- 50g grated manchet (a type of bread)
- Salt, to taste
- Sugar, to taste
- A pinch of musk (optional)

## Instructions:
1. In a saucepan, bring water to a boil and add the butter. Boil until the butter is melted.
2. In a mixing bowl, combine the flour and 4 egg yolks. Mix well.
3. Slowly pour the melted butter into the flour mixture, stirring continuously until a quick and stiff dough forms. Be careful not to make it too dry.
4. Blanch the almonds by placing them in boiling water for a few minutes, then remove the skins. Alternatively, you can use blanched almonds.
5. Grind the blanched almonds into a fine paste using a food processor or mortar and pestle.
6. Mince the cooked capon into very small pieces.
7. In a separate bowl, combine the minced capon, almond paste, rose water, cream, 8 egg yolks, grated manchet, salt, sugar, and a pinch of musk (if desired). Mix well until all the ingredients are fully incorporated.
8. Transfer the mixture to a broad skillet or stewpan and cook over medium heat, stirring constantly, until it thickens to a pap-like consistency. This may take about 15-20 minutes.
9. Once the mixture has thickened, strain it through a fine-mesh sieve to remove any lumps or solids.
10. Serve the blanc-manger in any desired form or fashion. It can be molded into individual servings or served in a larger dish.

## Cooking time
Approximately 15-20 minutes for cooking the mixture.
