# Preserved Cocks Combs

## Description
Preserved Cocks Combs is a traditional dish made from the combs of roosters. The combs are first boiled and then preserved in a mixture of bacon, vinegar, spices, and butter. This dish is typically served as a garnish or added to stews and sauces for added flavor and texture.

## Ingredients:
- Cocks combs (cleaned)
- Bacon (melted)
- Bay salt
- Pepper
- Vinegar
- Lemon (sliced)
- Onion (stuck with cloves)
- Butter (melted)

## Instructions:
1. Clean the cocks combs thoroughly, removing any excess fat or debris.
2. Place the cleaned combs in a pot and pour melted bacon over them.
3. Boil the combs in the bacon for a short period, approximately half an hour.
4. After half an hour, add bay salt, pepper, vinegar, sliced lemon, and the onion stuck with cloves to the pot.
5. Continue boiling the combs for another 30 minutes or until the bacon starts to stick to the pot.
6. Once cooked, remove the combs from the pot and transfer them to a pan or container for preservation.
7. Cover the combs with a linen cloth to protect them.
8. Pour melted butter over the combs, ensuring they are fully covered.
