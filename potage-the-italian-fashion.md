# Potage the Italian Fashion

## Description
Potage the Italian Fashion is a hearty and flavorful soup made with green peas, bacon, and a variety of herbs and spices. It is traditionally served with sippets (small pieces of toasted bread) and can be accompanied by boiled chickens, pigeons, lamb's head, duck, or any other type of fowl. The broth can also be thickened with eggs for a richer texture.

## Options and commentary
- You can use fresh or frozen green peas for this recipe.
- If you prefer a vegetarian version, you can omit the bacon and use vegetable broth instead of chicken broth.
- Feel free to adjust the amount of herbs and spices according to your taste preferences.

## Ingredients:
- 500g green peas
- 200g bacon, sliced into strips
- 1 liter strong chicken or vegetable broth
- 1 teaspoon black pepper
- 1 teaspoon aniseeds
- 2 tablespoons chopped parsley
- 2 eggs (optional)
- Sippets (small pieces of toasted bread)
- Boiled chickens, pigeons, lamb's head, duck, or any other fowl (optional)

## Instructions:
1. In a large pot, bring the chicken or vegetable broth to a boil.
2. Add the green peas and bacon strips to the boiling broth. Cook until the peas are tender.
3. Once the peas are cooked, add the black pepper, aniseeds, and chopped parsley to the pot. Stir well to combine.
4. Remove a small portion of the cooked peas from the pot and strain them to create a thickening agent for the broth. Mash or blend the strained peas until smooth.
5. Return the mashed peas to the pot and stir to thicken the broth.
6. Let the soup simmer for a few minutes to allow the flavors to meld together.
7. If desired, crack the eggs into a separate bowl and whisk them lightly. Slowly pour the beaten eggs into the simmering soup while stirring continuously. This will create a thicker and creamier texture.
8. Continue to cook the soup for another minute or two to ensure the eggs are fully cooked.
9. Remove the pot from the heat.
