# Duls Pullets a la Sainte Menehout

## Description
Duls Pullets a la Sainte Menehout is a classic 18th-century French dish made with chicken, veal, and a rich sauce. The chicken is stewed with veal, broth, cream, and milk, then coated in breadcrumbs and browned in the oven or on a stovetop. It is typically served with a ham-based sauce and can be enjoyed as a first course.

## Options and commentary
- Instead of pork loin, you can use chicken breasts or thighs.
- For the veal, you can use veal cutlets or stewing veal.
- The sauce can be made with chicken or vegetable broth for a lighter flavor.
- If you prefer a crispy coating, you can fry the chicken in oil instead of browning it in the oven.
- The dish can be served with a variety of sauces, such as a creamy mushroom sauce or a tangy tomato sauce.

## Ingredients:
- 4 chicken breasts or thighs
- 500g veal cutlets or stewing veal
- 2 tablespoons flour
- 500ml chicken or vegetable broth
- Salt and pepper to taste
- 1 onion, finely chopped
- 2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley
- 1 bouquet garni (a bundle of herbs such as thyme, bay leaf, and parsley)
- 100g bacon, cut into lardons (thin strips)
- 100ml cream
- 250ml milk
- 100g breadcrumbs
- 2 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese
- Oil or butter for frying (optional)
- Eggs, beaten (optional)
- Fried parsley for garnish (optional)
- Essence of ham or other sauce for serving

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F) if you plan to brown the chicken in the oven. If you prefer to fry the chicken, heat oil or butter in a frying pan over medium heat.
2. If using chicken breasts, butterfly them by cutting horizontally through the thickest part of each breast, stopping just before cutting all the way through. Open the breasts like a book and pound them gently to flatten. If using chicken thighs, remove the bone.
3. Cut the veal into thin slices.
4. In a large stew-pan, arrange a layer of veal slices on the bottom. Place the pan over medium heat and allow the veal to sweat.
5. Once the veal starts to stick to the pan, sprinkle flour over it and stir continuously to brown the flour.
6. Gradually pour in the broth, stirring constantly to avoid lumps. Season with salt, pepper, chopped onion, parsley, and the bouquet garni.
7. Lard the chicken with the bacon lardons by inserting them into the chicken meat.
8. Place the chicken in the stew-pan with the veal and sauce. Cover the pan and let it simmer over low heat for about 30 minutes, or until the chicken is cooked through.
9. After about 15 minutes of cooking, add the cream and milk to the stew-pan. Stir gently to combine.
10. Once the chicken is cooked, remove it from the stew-pan and let it cool in its own liquid.
11. Once cooled, remove the chicken from the liquid and rub it with the fat from the stewing liquid.
12. In a separate bowl, mix the breadcrumbs and grated Parmesan cheese.
13. Coat the chicken in the breadcrumb mixture, pressing gently to adhere.
14. If you plan to brown the chicken in the oven, place it in a pastry pan and bake for about 15 minutes, or until golden brown. If you prefer to fry the chicken, dip each piece in beaten eggs, then coat with breadcrumbs, and fry in hot oil or butter until crispy and golden.
15. Once cooked, transfer the chicken to a serving dish and pour the essence of ham or other sauce over it.
16. Garnish with fried parsley, if desired, and serve as a first course.

## Cooking time
- Stewing the chicken: approximately 30 minutes
- Browning in the oven: approximately 15 minutes
- Frying in oil or butter: approximately 5 minutes per side
