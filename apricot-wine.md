# Apricot Wine

## Description
Apricot wine is a sweet and fruity wine made from ripe apricots. It has a rich flavor and can be enjoyed on its own or used as a base for cocktails.

## Options and commentary
- You can adjust the amount of apricots and water depending on the desired sweetness and intensity of the wine.
- If fresh apricots are not available, you can use canned apricots in syrup as a substitute.
- The addition of Rhenish wine or small white wine adds complexity to the flavor, but it is optional.

## Ingredients:
- 5 kg ripe apricots
- 11 liters spring water
- 200 g apricot kernels
- 1 slice of toast
- 1 teaspoon yeast
- 250 ml Rhenish wine or small white wine (optional)

## Instructions:
1. Wash the apricots and remove the pits. Slice the apricots into small pieces.
2. In a large pot, bring the spring water to a boil. Add the sliced apricots and let it boil for a few minutes.
3. Skim off any scum that rises to the surface of the boiling water and apricots. Remove the pot from heat.
4. Place a clean sieve over a pan and pour the boiled apricots and water mixture into the sieve. Allow the liquid to drain into the pan. Discard the solids.
5. Crack the apricot kernels and place them, along with the shells, into a clean fermentation vessel.
6. Once the liquid in the pan has cooled, pour it into the fermentation vessel with the cracked apricot kernels. Stir them together.
7. Cover the fermentation vessel and let it sit for a few days until it settles.
8. After a few days, work the wine by adding a slice of toast and yeast to the fermentation vessel. Stir gently.
9. Cover the fermentation vessel again and let it continue to ferment until it is settled and clear.
10. Once the fermentation is complete, pour in the Rhenish wine or small white wine (if using). Stir gently.
11. Seal the fermentation vessel and let it age for six months.
12. After six months, check if the wine has clarified. If it has, you can bottle it. If not, let it age for a bit longer until it clears.
13. Once the wine is clear, bottle it and store it for at least one year before enjoying.

## Cooking time
- Boiling the apricots: approximately 10 minutes
- Fermentation and aging: 6 months to 1 year
