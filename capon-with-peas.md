# Capon with Peas

## Description
This recipe is for a traditional dish called Capon with Peas. It involves boiling a capon (a castrated rooster) with beef and bacon, and then serving it with boiled peas. The dish is hearty and flavorful, with the peas adding a fresh and vibrant element.

## Options and commentary
- Instead of a capon, you can use a whole chicken or chicken pieces.
- If you prefer a leaner option, you can use skinless chicken breast instead of beef.
- You can add additional vegetables such as carrots or onions for extra flavor.
- To make the dish more modern, you can puree some of the peas to create a creamy sauce.

## Ingredients:
- 1 whole chicken or capon
- 500g beef (such as stewing beef)

4. Using a blender or food processor, puree half of the peas until smooth. Set aside.
5. Add the remaining peas to the pot and continue boiling them in the broth for about 10 minutes, or until they are tender.
6. Remove the beef from the pot and set it aside.
7. Strain the peas from the broth and transfer them to a separate saucepan. Add the pureed peas to the saucepan as well.
