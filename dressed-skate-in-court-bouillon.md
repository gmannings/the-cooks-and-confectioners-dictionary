# Dressed Skate in Court Bouillon

## Description
This recipe is for preparing skate, specifically thornback skate, in court bouillon. Court bouillon is a flavorful poaching liquid made with water, vegetables, herbs, and spices. The skate is first gutted, washed, and boiled in the court bouillon. The liver is added to the boiling liquid briefly before removing the skate from the heat. Once the skate is almost cold, the skin is removed, thorns are picked out, and it is cleaned. The dressed skate is then served with a brown sauce made of butter, parsley, and a touch of vinegar.
