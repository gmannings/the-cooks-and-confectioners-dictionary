# Soop Lorrain

## Description
Soop Lorrain is a creamy soup made with a broth of veal and fowls, thickened with pounded almonds and French rolls. It is flavored with roasted pullet meat, eggs, and seasoned with salt, pepper, and nutmeg. The soup is served hot and garnished with toast, sweetbreads, lemon slices, and a rim.

## Ingredients:
- 1 pound veal
- 1 pound fowl (such as chicken or turkey)
- 1 pound almonds
- 2 roasted pullets (chicken)
- 4 eggs
- 2 French rolls
- 3 quarts veal broth
- Salt
- Pepper
- Nutmeg
- Butter
- Toasted French bread
- Sweetbreads (optional)
- Lemon slices

## Instructions:
1. In a large pot, make a broth by boiling the veal and fowl in water. Strain the broth and set aside.
2. Blanch the almonds by placing them in boiling water for a few minutes, then remove the skins. Pound the almonds in a mortar with a little water to prevent them from boiling.
3. In a separate bowl, combine the pounded almonds with the lean meat from the roasted pullets and the yolks of the boiled eggs. Mix well using a mortar and pestle.
4. Cut the crusts of the French rolls into slices and boil them in the veal broth. Add the pounded almond mixture to the broth and let it simmer for a few minutes.
5. Strain the mixture through a fine strainer to achieve a creamy consistency.
6. Mince the meat from the roasted pullet breasts and place it in a loaf-shaped dish. Remove the top of the loaf and the crumb from the center.
7. Season the minced meat with salt, pepper, and scraped nutmeg. Add butter and half a dozen spoonfuls of the strained almond mixture to the minced meat. Mix well.
8. Line the bottom of a soup dish with toasted French bread soaked in clear broth. Optionally, you can also place four boiled sweetbreads around the loaf.
9. Pour the creamy almond mixture over the bread and sweetbreads in the soup dish.
10. Garnish the soup with a rim and slices of lemon.
11. Serve the Soop Lorrain hot.
