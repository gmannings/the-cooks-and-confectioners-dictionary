# Roasted Pullet with Stuffed Olives

## Description
This recipe is for a roasted pullet (young chicken) that is stuffed with a flavorful mixture and served with a ragout of stuffed olives. The pullet is first deboned and the flesh is used to make a stuffing. The olives are also stuffed with the same mixture and cooked separately. The pullet is then roasted and served with the ragout of olives.

## Ingredients:
- 1 pullet (about 1.5 kg)
- 200g beef suet
- 100g blanched bacon, minced
- 100g mushrooms, minced
- 2 tbsp chives, chopped
- 2 tbsp parsley, chopped
- 1 French roll, soaked in cream
- 2 egg yolks
- Salt and pepper to taste
- Mixed spices (such as nutmeg, cloves, and cinnamon)
- Fresh herbs (such as thyme and rosemary)
- 40-50 large olives
- Essence of ham (can be substituted with chicken or vegetable broth)

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 180°C.
2. Raise the skin of the breasts of the pullet and carefully remove the flesh from the breasts, taking care to remove the breast bone.
3. In a bowl, combine the minced pullet breast, beef suet, minced bacon, mushrooms, chives, parsley, soaked French roll, and egg yolks. Season with salt, pepper, mixed spices, and fresh herbs. Mix well.
4. Pound the mixture in a mortar until well combined and smooth.
5. Stuff the pullet with the prepared stuffing mixture. Tie the neck and rump of the pullet with kitchen twine to secure the stuffing.
6. Cover the pullet with bacon slices, then wrap it tightly in parchment paper.
7. Spit the pullet and place it on a roasting rack in a roasting pan.
8. Roast the pullet in the preheated oven for about 1 hour and 30 minutes, or until the internal temperature reaches 75°C.
9. While the pullet is roasting, prepare the stuffed olives. Slit the olives at the stalk end and carefully remove the stones, being careful not to break the skin.
10. Stuff the olives with the same stuffing mixture used for the pullet.
11. Bring a saucepan of water to a boil and blanch the stuffed olives for a few minutes. Remove them from the water and transfer them to another saucepan.
12. Add the essence of ham to the saucepan with the olives and simmer over low heat for about 15 minutes.
13. Once the pullet is roasted, remove it from the oven and let it rest for a few minutes before carving.
14. To serve, place the carved pullet on a serving platter and pour the ragout of stuffed olives over it.
15. Serve the roasted pullet with stuffed olives as the first course.
