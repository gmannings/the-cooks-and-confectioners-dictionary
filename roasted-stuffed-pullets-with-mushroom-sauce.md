# Roasted Stuffed Pullets with Mushroom Sauce

## Description
This recipe is a modernized version of an 18th-century dish called "To dzels Pullets the Engliſh way." It features roasted pullets stuffed with a flavorful mixture of bacon, calf's udder, marrow, veal sweetbreads, mushrooms, truffles, artichoke bottoms, capers, and garlic. The pullets are then wrapped in bacon, roasted, and served with a rich mushroom sauce. This dish is perfect for a special occasion or a fancy dinner.

## Options and commentary
- Instead of calf's udder, you can use veal kidney or liver as a substitute.
- If you can't find veal sweetbreads, you can use chicken or pork sweetbreads instead.
- If you don't have access to fresh truffles, you can use truffle oil or truffle salt to add a similar flavor.
- The garlic can be adjusted to your taste preference. You can use less or omit it entirely if you're not a fan of garlic.
- The mushroom sauce can be made ahead of time and reheated before serving.

## Ingredients:
- 2 pullets (small chickens)
- 4 slices of bacon
- 100g bacon, finely chopped
- 100g calf's udder (or veal kidney/liver), finely chopped
- 50g marrow, finely chopped
- 50g veal sweetbreads (or chicken/pork sweetbreads), finely chopped
- 50g mushrooms, finely chopped
- 2 truffles, finely chopped (or truffle oil/truffle salt)
- 4 artichoke bottoms, finely chopped
- 2 tablespoons capers, finely chopped
- 2 cloves of garlic, minced
- Salt and pepper to taste
- 1 cup veal or chicken broth
- Juice of 1 orange

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F).
2. In a mixing bowl, combine the chopped bacon, calf's udder (or veal kidney/liver), marrow, veal sweetbreads (or chicken/pork sweetbreads), mushrooms, truffles (or truffle oil/truffle salt), artichoke bottoms, capers, and minced garlic. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Mix well to form a stuffing mixture.
3. Carefully stuff the pullets with the stuffing mixture, making sure to fill the cavities evenly. Secure the openings with toothpicks or kitchen twine.
4. Place two slices of bacon on the breasts of each pullet, covering them completely.
5. Wrap each pullet tightly in a piece of parchment paper or aluminum foil, ensuring that the bacon stays in place.
6. Place the wrapped pullets on a roasting pan and roast in the preheated oven for about 1 hour, or until the internal temperature reaches 75°C (165°F).
7. While the pullets are roasting, prepare the mushroom sauce. In a saucepan, combine the chopped mushrooms, anchovies, capers, and veal or chicken broth. Simmer over low heat for about 15 minutes, allowing the flavors to meld together.
8. Remove the pullets from the oven and carefully unwrap them from the parchment paper or aluminum foil. Place them back on the roasting pan and return to the oven for an additional 10 minutes, or until the bacon is crispy.
9. Remove the pullets from the oven and let them rest for a few minutes before serving.
10. Meanwhile, strain the mushroom sauce to remove any solids. Return the sauce to the saucepan and add the juice of 1 orange. Simmer for another 5 minutes to allow the flavors to combine.
11. To serve, slice the roasted pullets and drizzle the mushroom sauce over the top. Serve hot and enjoy!
