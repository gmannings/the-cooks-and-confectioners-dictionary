# Carp a la Royale

## Description
Carp a la Royale is a classic French dish that features carp cooked in a flavorful marinade and served with a rich buttery sauce. The fish is tender and flavorful, and the sauce adds a luxurious touch to the dish. It is a perfect option for a special occasion or a fancy dinner.

## Ingredients:
- 2 carp (approximately 1 kg each)
- 500 ml red wine (Claret)
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 250 ml vinegar
- 1 teaspoon whole spices (such as peppercorns, cloves, and bay leaves)
- 2 whole onions
- Peel of 1 lemon, shredded
- 1 horseradish root, grated
- 100 g butter
- 2 anchovies
- 100 g shrimp
- 100 g oysters
- Sippets (small pieces of toasted bread)
- Slices of lemon and horseradish for garnish

## Instructions:
1. Wash the carp thoroughly and remove the guts.
2. In a large bowl, prepare the marinade by combining the red wine, salt, vinegar, whole spices, whole onions, shredded lemon peel, and grated horseradish.
3. Place the carp in the marinade and let it marinate for at least 1 hour, but preferably overnight in the refrigerator.
4. After marinating, remove the carp from the marinade and pat them dry with paper towels.
5. In a large pot, heat the marinade over medium heat and bring it to a gentle simmer.
6. Add the carp to the simmering marinade and cook for about 45 minutes, or until the fish is tender.
7. While the carp is cooking, prepare the sauce. In a separate saucepan, melt the butter over low heat.
8. Add a couple of tablespoons of the fish broth from the pot to the melted butter, along with the anchovies, shrimp, and oysters.
9. Cook the sauce gently, stirring occasionally, until the shrimp and oysters are cooked through.
10. Remove the carp from the pot and place them on sippets (toasted bread).
11. Pour the sauce over the carp.
12. Garnish the dish with the fish milts, slices of lemon, and grated horseradish.
