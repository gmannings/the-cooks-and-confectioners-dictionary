# Almond Cheele

## Description
Almond Cheele is a sweet and creamy dessert made with almonds, cream, and rosewater. It is shaped like a cheese and served cold. This recipe is a modernized version of an 18th-century recipe.

## Ingredients:
- 200g almonds, finely ground
- 250ml heavy cream
- 50ml sweet white wine (such as Sauternes or Muscat)
- 50g powdered sugar
- 1 tablespoon rosewater
- Additional powdered sugar for garnish

## Instructions:
1. In a bowl, combine the finely ground almonds, heavy cream, and sweet white wine. Mix well to form a smooth paste.
2. Place the mixture in a chafing dish or a heatproof bowl set over a pot of simmering water. Cook the mixture over low heat, stirring constantly, for about 10-15 minutes or until it thickens and becomes creamy.
3. Add the powdered sugar and rosewater to the almond mixture. Stir well to combine.
4. Line a pie plate or a round dish with plastic wrap. Transfer the almond mixture to the dish and shape it into a cheese-like form.
5. Place the dish in the refrigerator and let it chill for at least 2 hours or until it is firm.
6. Once chilled, remove the almond cheele from the dish and transfer it to a serving plate.
7. Sprinkle powdered sugar over the top of the almond cheele.
8. Serve cold.
