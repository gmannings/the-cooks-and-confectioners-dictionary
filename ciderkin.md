# Ciderkin

## Description
Ciderkin is a refreshing and lightly alcoholic beverage made from apples. It has a slightly sweet and tangy taste, perfect for enjoying on a warm day.

## Options and commentary
- You can use any variety of apples for this recipe, but tart and crisp apples like Granny Smith or Braeburn work well.
- If you prefer a sweeter ciderkin, you can add a small amount of sugar or honey during the fermentation process.
- The fermentation process can take anywhere from a few days to a few weeks, depending on the temperature and desired level of carbonation.

## Ingredients:
- 1 peck (approximately 9 liters) of apples
- Water
- Sugar or honey (optional)

## Instructions:
1. Wash the apples thoroughly and remove any stems or leaves.
2. Peel the apples using a peeler or a knife.
3. Core the apples using an apple corer or a small knife.
4. Cut the apples into quarters or smaller pieces.
5. In a large barrel or pot, add the apples and cover them with water. The water should be enough to completely submerge the apples.
6. Bring the water to a boil and let the apples simmer for several hours until a third of the liquid has evaporated. This will concentrate the flavors of the apples.
7. Strain the liquid through a fine-mesh sieve or cheesecloth to remove any solids. Discard the boiled apples.
8. In a separate container, add a bushel (approximately 35 liters) of ground or mashed unboiled apples.
9. Pour the strained liquid over the unboiled apples and mix well.
10. Cover the container and let it sit at room temperature for 24 hours to allow the mixture to ferment.
11. After 24 hours, press the mixture to extract the liquid. You can use a fruit press or simply squeeze the mixture through a clean cloth.
12. Transfer the extracted liquid to a clean, airtight container such as a glass carboy or a fermentation vessel.
13. Allow the liquid to ferment for several days to several weeks, depending on your preference. The longer it ferments, the stronger and more carbonated the ciderkin will become.
14. During the fermentation process, make sure to release any built-up pressure by opening the container occasionally. This will prevent the container from bursting.
15. Once the ciderkin has reached your desired level of fermentation, stop the fermentation process by sealing the container tightly.
16. Let the ciderkin sit undisturbed for a few days to allow any sediment to settle at the bottom.
17. Carefully siphon or pour the clear ciderkin into bottles, leaving the sediment behind.
18. Seal the bottles tightly and store them in a cool, dark place for a few weeks to allow the flavors to develop.
19. After the aging period, the ciderkin is ready to be enjoyed. Serve it chilled or over ice.

## Cooking time
- Boiling the apples: Several hours
- Fermentation: Several days to several weeks
- Aging: Several weeks
