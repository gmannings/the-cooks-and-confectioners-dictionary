# Bouton

## Description
Bouton is a dish made with layers of seasoned Godivoc (a type of forcemeat), bacon, and a ragout of veal sweetbreads, mushrooms, artichoke bottoms, truffles, and asparagus tops. It is then baked and served with a garnish of stuffed rolls, fricandoes, and marinades.

## Options and commentary
- You can use pork or beef mince as a modern alternative to Godivoc.
- If you don't have access to veal sweetbreads, you can substitute with chicken or turkey sweetbreads.
- If truffles are not available, you can use truffle oil or mushroom powder for a similar flavor.
- The dish can be baked in the oven or cooked on the stovetop.

## Ingredients:
- For the Godivoc:
  - 500g pork or beef mince
  - 1 onion, finely chopped
  - 2 cloves of garlic, minced
  - 1 teaspoon dried herbs (such as thyme, rosemary, or sage)
  - Salt and pepper to taste
- For the ragout:
  - 200g veal sweetbreads, blanched and diced
  - 100g mushrooms, sliced
  - 100g artichoke bottoms, diced
  - 50g truffles, thinly sliced or 1 tablespoon truffle oil/mushroom powder
  - 100g asparagus tops
  - 1 cup white sauce (béchamel)
- 8 slices of bacon
- Juice of 1 lemon
- Garnish:
  - Stuffed rolls
  - Fricandoes
  - Marinades (pickled vegetables)

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F) if baking or heat a large skillet over medium heat if cooking on the stovetop.

2. In a bowl, combine the pork or beef mince, chopped onion, minced garlic, dried herbs, salt, and pepper. Mix well to combine.

3. Lay out the bacon slices on a clean surface. Spread a layer of the Godivoc mixture evenly over each slice of bacon.

4. In a separate bowl, combine the diced veal sweetbreads, sliced mushrooms, diced artichoke bottoms, sliced truffles or truffle oil/mushroom powder, and asparagus tops. Mix well to combine.

5. Spread a layer of the ragout mixture over the Godivoc-covered bacon slices.

6. Cover the ragout layer with another layer of Godivoc-covered bacon slices.

7. If baking, place the Bouton in a baking dish and bake in the preheated oven for 45-60 minutes, or until the bacon is crispy and the Godivoc is cooked through.

8. If cooking on the stovetop, heat the skillet and place the Bouton in the skillet. Cook for 10-15 minutes on each side, or until the bacon is crispy and the Godivoc is cooked through.

9. Once the Bouton is cooked, remove any excess fat and drizzle the lemon juice over the top.

10. Garnish the Bouton with stuffed rolls, fricandoes, and marinades. Serve hot.
