# Tibet of a Hare

## Description
Tibet of a Hare is a traditional dish made from hare meat that is larded with bacon and cooked in a flavorful broth and white wine. The dish is seasoned with salt, pepper, nutmeg, herbs, bay leaf, and lemon. The liver is fricasseed and strained to create a sauce that is poured over the cooked hare before serving.

## Ingredients:
- 1 hare, cut into pieces
- Bacon, for larding
- Strong broth
- White wine
- Salt
- Pepper
- 1 nutmeg, grated
- 1 bunch of herbs (such as thyme, rosemary, and parsley)
- 1 bay leaf
- 1 lemon, sliced
- Liver from the hare
- Cullis (a rich, thickened sauce)

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F).
2. Cut off the legs and wings of the hare, and then cut the body into pieces.
3. Lard the hare pieces with bacon by inserting small strips of bacon into the meat.
4. In a large pot, melt some bacon fat and add the larded hare pieces. Cook them until they are browned on all sides.
5. Pour in enough strong broth and white wine to cover the hare pieces.
6. Season the broth with salt, pepper, grated nutmeg, the bunch of herbs, bay leaf, and sliced lemon.
7. Bring the broth to a simmer, then cover the pot and transfer it to the preheated oven.
8. Cook the hare in the oven for about 2-3 hours, or until the meat is tender and easily falls off the bone.
9. While the hare is cooking, fricassee the liver by cooking it in a separate pan until it is cooked through.
10. Once the liver is cooked, remove it from the pan and pound it in a mortar until it forms a paste.
11. Strain the liver paste through a sieve, using a little of the broth and cullis to help create a smooth sauce.
12. Once the hare is cooked, remove it from the pot and transfer it to a serving dish.
13. Pour the liver sauce over the hare, ensuring that it is evenly coated.
14. Serve the Tibet of a Hare hot.
