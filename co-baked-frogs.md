# Co-baked Frogs

## Description
Co-baked frogs is a traditional dish from the 18th century. It consists of frog legs seasoned with salt, pepper, and nutmeg, and then baked in a pie with a variety of ingredients such as mace, lemon slices, sweet herbs, barberries or grapes, artichokes, potatoes or parsnips, skirrets, and marrow. The pie is then baked until golden and served with a butter and citrus sauce.

## Options and commentary
- Instead of frog legs, you can use chicken or turkey legs as a modern alternative.
- You can add other vegetables of your choice, such as carrots or mushrooms, to the pie filling.
- If you prefer a vegetarian version, you can omit the meat and use a combination of vegetables and plant-based protein alternatives like tofu or tempeh.
- The sauce can be made with butter and either orange juice or grape verjuice. Grape verjuice can be found in specialty stores or online, but if you can't find it, you can substitute it with a combination of grape juice and vinegar.

## Ingredients:
- 4 frog legs (or chicken/turkey legs)
- Salt
- Pepper
- Nutmeg
- 1 sheet of pie crust
- 1/2 teaspoon whole mace
- 1 lemon, sliced
- 2 tablespoons minced sweet herbs (such as parsley, thyme, and rosemary)
- 1/4 cup barberries or grapes
- 1 cup artichoke hearts, quartered
- 1 cup diced potatoes or parsnips
- 1 cup skirrets (a type of root vegetable), sliced
- 1/2 cup marrow, diced
- 2 tablespoons butter
- Juice of 1 orange or 1/4 cup grape verjuice

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F).
2. If using frog legs, remove the skin and cut off the feet. If using chicken or turkey legs, leave them as they are.
3. Season the frog legs or chicken/turkey legs with salt, pepper, and nutmeg.
4. Roll out the pie crust and line a pie dish with it.
5. Place the seasoned frog legs or chicken/turkey legs in the pie dish.
6. Sprinkle the whole mace, lemon slices, minced sweet herbs, barberries or grapes, artichoke hearts, diced potatoes or parsnips, skirrets, and marrow over the legs.
7. Cover the pie dish with another sheet of pie crust and seal the edges.
8. Bake the pie in the preheated oven for about 45 minutes, or until the crust is golden and the filling is cooked through.
9. While the pie is baking, melt the butter in a small saucepan and add the juice of the orange or grape verjuice. Heat gently until warmed through.
10. Once the pie is done baking, remove it from the oven and pour the butter and citrus sauce over the top.
11. Allow the pie to cool slightly before serving.
