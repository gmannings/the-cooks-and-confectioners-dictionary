# Ragoo of Endive

## Description
A ragoo of endive is a dish made with blanched endive cooked in a sauce made from veal and ham. It is a savory and flavorful side dish that pairs well with various main courses.

## Ingredients:
- 4 heads of endive
- 200ml veal stock
- 100g ham, diced
- Salt and pepper to taste

## Instructions:
1. Start by preparing the endive. Pick the endive leaves and discard any damaged or wilted ones.
2. Blanch the endive by placing it in a pot of boiling water for about 2 minutes. This will help remove any bitterness. 
3. Remove the blanched endive from the pot and immediately transfer it to a bowl of cold water to stop the cooking process.
4. Squeeze out any excess water from the endive and give it a few cuts to break it up into smaller pieces.
5. In a saucepan, combine the veal stock and diced ham. Bring it to a simmer over medium heat.
6. Add the blanched endive to the saucepan and let it simmer gently for about 10 minutes, stirring occasionally.
7. If the sauce is not thick enough, you can add a little more veal stock or reduce the sauce further.
8. Season with salt and pepper to taste.
9. Serve the ragoo of endive as a side dish with your choice of main course.
