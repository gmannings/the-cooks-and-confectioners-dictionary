# Potage of Beef

## Description
Potage of Beef is a hearty and flavorful beef stew that was popular in the 18th century. The beef is slow-cooked until tender and then seasoned with a variety of herbs and spices. The stew is served with soaked bread and garnished with the cooked meat.

## Ingredients:
- 1 leg of beef
- Salt
- A faggot of savory herbs (such as thyme, rosemary, and parsley)
- Cloves
- Capers
- Samphire (optional)
- Mushrooms (optional)
- Bread

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F).
2. Place the leg of beef in a large pot and cover it with water.
3. Bring the water to a boil over high heat, then reduce the heat to low and simmer the beef for several hours, until it is very tender and falls apart easily.
4. Remove the beef from the pot and set it aside to cool slightly.
5. Once the beef is cool enough to handle, shred or cut it into bite-sized pieces.
6. Return the shredded beef to the pot and season it with salt, cloves, capers, and the faggot of savory herbs.
7. If using, add samphire and mushrooms to the pot.
8. Simmer the stew for an additional 30 minutes to allow the flavors to meld together.
9. While the stew is simmering, soak slices of bread in water until they become soft.
10. Place the soaked bread in a serving dish and arrange the cooked meat on top.
11. Garnish the dish with any remaining herbs or spices.
