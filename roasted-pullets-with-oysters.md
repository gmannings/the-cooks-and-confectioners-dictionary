## Description
This recipe is for roasted pullets (young chickens) that are stuffed with a flavorful mixture of ham, bacon, herbs, and spices.

- 200ml veal gravy

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 180째C (350째F).

3. Remove the flesh from the breasts and set it aside.
4. In a bowl, combine the ham, bacon, beef suet, chives, parsley, sweet herbs, salt, and pepper. Mix well.
5. Soak the French roll in cream until softened.
6. In a separate bowl, beat the raw eggs.
7. Add the softened French roll and the beaten eggs to the ham mixture. Mix well until everything is combined.
8. Mince the mixture finely or blend it in a food processor until smooth.
9. Stuff the pullets with the mixture, leaving a hole in the middle of each breast.
