# Mufcadel Ratafia

## Description
Mufcadel Ratafia is a sweet liqueur made from ripe Mufcadel grapes, brandy, and spices. It has a rich and fruity flavor with hints of spice.

## Ingredients:
- 1 kg ripe Mufcadel grapes
- 1 liter brandy
- 250 grams sugar
- 2-3 pieces of mace
- 4-5 cloves
- 1 cinnamon stick
- A few grains of black pepper
- A grain of musk (optional)

## Instructions:
1. Wash the Mufcadel grapes and remove any stems or leaves.
2. Press the grapes to extract the juice. You can use a juicer or crush them by hand and strain the juice.
3. Measure the amount of grape juice obtained and pour it into a large earthenware container.
4. Add an equal amount of brandy to the grape juice. For example, if you have 1 liter of grape juice, add 1 liter of brandy.
5. Add the sugar to the mixture and stir until it dissolves completely.
6. Place the mace, cloves, cinnamon stick, and black pepper grains into a small muslin bag or cheesecloth.
7. Add the spice bag to the grape juice and brandy mixture.
8. Cover the container and let it infuse for 2-3 days at room temperature. This will allow the flavors to meld together.
9. After the infusion period, remove the spice bag from the mixture.
10. To clarify the ratafia, strain it through a fine-mesh strainer or a straining bag to remove any sediment or impurities.
11. Transfer the clarified ratafia into clean bottles.
12. If desired, add a grain of musk to each bottle for additional aroma. Be cautious with the amount of musk, as it has a strong flavor.
13. Seal the bottles tightly and store them in a cool, dark place for at least a month to allow the flavors to develop.
