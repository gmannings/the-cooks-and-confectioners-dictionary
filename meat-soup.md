# Meat Soup

## Description
Meat Soup is a hearty and flavorful dish made from a combination of veal, mutton, and beef. The meat is boiled until tender and then strained to create a rich broth. The broth is then seasoned with spices, claret wine, and anchovies for added depth of flavor. The soup is further enhanced with ox-palates, veal sweetbreads, and a variety of herbs. It is served with toasts topped with sweetbreads and ox-palates, and a boiled chicken breast stuffed with force-meat in the center. This dish is a delicious and satisfying meal.

## Options and commentary
- You can use any type of meat you prefer, such as chicken or pork, in addition to or instead of the veal, mutton, and beef.
- Feel free to add other vegetables or herbs to the soup, such as carrots, celery, or parsley, to enhance the flavor.
- If you don't have claret wine, you can use red wine or beef broth as a substitute.
- If you don't have ox-palates or veal sweetbreads, you can omit them or replace them with other meats or vegetables of your choice.
- The force-meat stuffing for the chicken breast can be made with a mixture of ground meat, breadcrumbs, herbs, and spices.

## Instructions:
1. In a large pot, combine the knuckle of veal, crag end of a neck of mutton, and piece of coarse beef. Add enough water to cover the meat.
2. Season the water with salt, whole pepper, and the onion. Bring the water to a boil and then reduce the heat to low. Simmer the meat for several hours until it becomes very tender and starts to fall apart.
3. Once the meat is cooked, remove it from the pot and strain the cooking liquid into a separate container. Discard the onion and any other solids.
4. In a stew-pan, combine the strained cooking liquid with the cloves, mace, and lemon peel. Place the stew-pan over a stove and bring the liquid to a boil.
5. Add the claret wine to the stew-pan and continue to boil for a few minutes.
6. In a separate pan, fry the piece of lean beef until browned. Remove the beef from the pan and squeeze out the gravy into the stew-pan.
7. Add the anchovies to the stew-pan and stir to combine. Allow the soup to simmer for a few more minutes to allow the flavors to meld together.
8. In a separate pot, boil the ox-palates until tender. Once cooked, dice them into small pieces.
9. Add the diced ox-palates, veal sweetbreads, spinach, endive, lettuce, and any other herbs or vegetables you desire to the soup. Stir well to combine.
10. To serve, place thin toasts of French bread on a serving dish. Arrange the sweetbreads and ox-palates over the toasts.
11. Place the boiled chicken breast stuffed with force-meat in the center of the dish.
12. Pour the soup over the toasts, sweetbreads, and chicken breast.
13. Serve the Meat Soup hot and enjoy!
