# Conserve of Damsons

## Description
This recipe provides instructions for making two different types of preserves using damsons (a type of plum). The first is a conserve made with wine or rosewater, while the second is a method for keeping damsons for use in tarts throughout the year.

## Options and commentary
- Instead of wine or damask rosewater, you can use red wine or even water as a substitute in the conserve recipe.
- For the second method, you can adjust the amount of sugar based on your preference for sweetness.
- The recipe suggests using rye dough to seal the pot, but you can use regular pie dough or even aluminum foil as a modern alternative.

## Ingredients:
### Conserve of Damsons:
- 4 quarts of damsons
- 2 quarts of wine or damask rosewater
- Sugar (quantity not specified)

### To keep Damsons for Tarts:
- Damsons (quantity not specified)
- Fine powdered sugar
- Rye dough (or pie dough or aluminum foil)

## Instructions:
### Conserve of Damsons:
1. Prick the damsons with a fork.
2. In a pot, combine the pricked damsons and the wine or damask rosewater.
3. Cover the pot and bring the mixture to a boil, stirring well.

5. Let the mixture cool, then strain it, reserving the liquid.
6. Return the pulp to the pot and add a sufficient quantity of sugar.
7. Boil the mixture until it reaches the desired consistency.
8. Transfer the conserve to pots for storage.

### To keep Damsons for Tarts:
1. Wipe the damsons to clean them.
2. In an earthen pot, layer the damsons, sprinkling fine powdered sugar between each layer. Use approximately 2 pounds of sugar for every 6 pounds of damsons.
3. Once all the damsons are in the pot, seal it with rye dough, pie dough, or aluminum foil.
4. Bake the pot with the damsons along with some six-penny bread.
5. After baking, let the pot cool completely.
6. Cut a stick and insert it into the middle of the pot, leaving it sticking out.
7. Cut a piece of white paper to cover the damsons, making a hole in the middle for the stick to go through.
8. Melt fresh butter and pour it over the paper to seal it.
9. When you want to take out some damsons, remove the paper using the stick. Replace the paper when finished.
10. This method will allow you to keep the damsons for an extended period.

## Cooking time
- Cooking time for the conserve will vary depending on the tenderness of the damsons and the desired consistency.
- Baking time for the pot of damsons for tarts will depend on the recipe used for the bread.
