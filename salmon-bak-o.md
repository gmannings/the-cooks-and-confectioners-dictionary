## Ingredients:
- 1 salmon fillet (about 1 kg)
- Salt, to taste
- Pepper, to taste
- Ginger, ground or fresh, to taste
- Cloves, ground or whole, to taste
- Mace, ground or whole, to taste
- Slices of ginger
- Large mace
- Butter
- Pastry crust (puff pastry or pie crust)

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 180Â°C.
2. Scale the salmon by running a knife against the grain of the fish to remove the scales. Rinse the salmon under cold water and pat it dry with paper towels.
3. Remove the backbone of the salmon by making a cut along the spine. Season the salmon fillet with salt, pepper, ginger, cloves, and mace on both sides.
4. Lay the seasoned salmon fillet on a sheet of pastry crust and shape it to resemble a salmon.
5. Place slices of ginger and large mace on top of the salmon fillet. Dot the salmon with small pieces of butter.
6. Fold the other half of the pastry crust over the salmon, enclosing it completely. Press the edges of the pastry together to seal it.
7. Place the salmon bak'o on a baking sheet and bake in the preheated oven for about 30-40 minutes, or until the pastry is golden brown and the salmon is cooked through.
8. Remove the salmon bak'o from the oven and let it cool completely before serving. It can be served cold or at room temperature.
