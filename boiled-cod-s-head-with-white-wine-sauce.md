# Boiled Cod's Head with White Wine Sauce

## Description
This recipe is for a classic boiled cod's head dish, served with a flavorful white wine sauce. The cod's head is boiled in a seasoned liquid and then served with a tangy sauce made from the cooking liquid. It is garnished with slices of lemon and scraped horseradish for added flavor and presentation.

## Ingredients:
- 1 cod's head
- 1 pint (473 ml) white wine
- Water, enough to cover the cod's head
- 1 handful of salt
- 2 bay leaves
- 1 onion, quartered
- 1 small piece of lemon peel
- 1 teaspoon cracked black pepper
- 1 teaspoon allspice
- Slices of lemon, for garnish
- Scraped horseradish, for garnish

## Instructions:
1. Cut the cod's head into large pieces.
2. In a large pot, combine the white wine, enough water to cover the cod's head, salt, bay leaves, onion, lemon peel, cracked black pepper, and allspice.
3. Bring the liquid to a boil and let it simmer for a few minutes to allow the flavors to meld together.
4. Carefully add the cod's head pieces to the pot and let them boil until cooked through. This will take about 15-20 minutes, depending on the size of the head pieces.
5. Once the cod's head is cooked, remove it from the pot and drain well.
6. Prepare the sauce by straining the cooking liquid and discarding the solids.
7. In a separate saucepan, heat the strained cooking liquid over medium heat until it reduces and thickens slightly.
