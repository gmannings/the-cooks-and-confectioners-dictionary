# Preserved Apricots in Jelly

## Description
This recipe is for preserving apricots in a sweet jelly. The apricots are cooked in a sugar syrup until tender and then placed in jars with the syrup. The syrup can be strained for a clearer jelly, if desired.

## Ingredients:
- 1 kg apricots
- 1 kg double refined sugar
- 250 ml pippin liquor (apple juice can be used as a substitute)

## Instructions:
1. Stone and peel the apricots.
2. In a large pan, layer a portion of the sugar at the bottom, followed by a layer of apricots.
3. Allow the sugar to melt slightly before placing the pan on the fire.
4. Boil the apricots in the sugar syrup, stirring occasionally to prevent sticking and to maintain the color.
5. Skim off any scum that rises to the surface of the syrup.
6. Continue boiling until the apricots are tender.
7. Transfer the cooked apricots to sterilized jars.
8. In a separate pan, combine the pippin liquor and the weight of the syrup in double refined sugar.
9. Boil the syrup mixture for a while and then pour it over the apricots in the jars.
10. If a clear jelly is desired, strain the syrup through a jelly bag before pouring it over the apricots.
11. Seal the jars tightly and store them in a cool, dark place.

## Cooking time
Approximately 1-2 hours, depending on the size and ripeness of the apricots.
