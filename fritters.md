# Fritters

## Description
Fritters are a type of fried pastry or dough that can be sweet or savory. This recipe is for sweet fritters made with a creamy batter and slices of apples.

## Options and commentary
- You can use any type of apple for this recipe, but tart apples like Granny Smith or Braeburn work well.
- If you don't have Canary wine, you can substitute it with a sweet white wine or apple juice.
- The spices can be adjusted to your taste. You can also add a touch of vanilla extract for extra flavor.

## Ingredients:
- 500 ml cream
- 100 g all-purpose flour
- 12 eggs
- Pinch of salt
- 1 tsp ground cinnamon
- 1/2 tsp grated nutmeg
- 1/2 tsp ground ginger
- 2 tbsp Canary wine (or substitute)
- 2-3 tart apples, thinly sliced
- Vegetable oil or lard for frying

## Instructions:
1. In a mixing bowl, whisk together the cream and flour until well combined and smooth.
2. In a separate bowl, beat the eggs, leaving out the whites of 8 eggs.
3. Add the beaten eggs to the cream and flour mixture, and whisk until fully incorporated.
4. Stir in the salt, cinnamon, nutmeg, ginger, and Canary wine. Mix well.
5. Add another pint (500 ml) of cream to the batter and continue to beat for almost an hour. This will help to aerate the batter and make the fritters light and fluffy.
6. Heat vegetable oil or lard in a deep pan or fryer to a temperature of 180°C (350°F).
7. Dip the apple slices into the batter, making sure they are well coated.
8. Carefully place the coated apple slices into the hot oil and fry until golden brown and crispy, about 2-3 minutes per side.
9. Remove the fritters from the oil using a slotted spoon or tongs, and place them on a paper towel-lined plate to drain excess oil.
10. Repeat the process with the remaining apple slices and batter.
11. Serve the fritters warm, dusted with powdered sugar or drizzled with honey, if desired.
