# Broiled Lampreys

## Description
Broiled lampreys are a dish made from lampreys, a type of eel-like fish. The lampreys are cut into pieces, seasoned with herbs and spices, and then broiled on a gridiron. They are served with a flavorful sauce made from browned butter, mushrooms, herbs, and fish broth.

## Options and commentary
- Lampreys can be difficult to find, so you can substitute with eel or another firm-fleshed fish.
- The sauce can be made in two ways: one with a thickened cullis (a type of sauce made from reduced stock) and the other with a simple mixture of oil, vinegar, mustard, and herbs. Choose the sauce that suits your taste preferences.

## Ingredients:
- 500g lampreys (or substitute with eel or another firm-fleshed fish)
- 50g butter
- Salt and pepper to taste
- 1 tablespoon finely chopped savory herbs (such as parsley, chives, and tarragon)
- 2 tablespoons grated bread
- For the sauce:
  - 50g butter
  - 1 tablespoon flour
  - 50g mushrooms, finely chopped
  - 1 tablespoon finely chopped chives
  - 1 tablespoon finely chopped parsley
  - Salt and pepper to taste
  - 1 anchovy, finely chopped
  - 1 tablespoon capers
  - 100ml fish broth
  - For the alternative sauce:
    - 2 tablespoons oil
    - 1 tablespoon vinegar
    - Salt and pepper to taste
    - 1 teaspoon mustard
    - 1 tablespoon finely chopped parsley
    - 1 anchovy, finely chopped
    - 1 tablespoon capers

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the broiler or grill to medium-high heat.
2. Wash the lampreys (or fish) in hot water to remove any slime. Cut them into pieces as you would for broiling.
3. In a saucepan, melt the butter. Season it with salt, pepper, and the finely chopped savory herbs (parsley, chives, and tarragon).
4. Add the lamprey pieces to the seasoned butter in the saucepan and stir well to coat them.
5. Remove the lamprey pieces from the saucepan and dredge them with grated bread.
6. Place the lamprey pieces on a greased gridiron or grill pan and broil them over a gentle fire for about 5-7 minutes on each side, or until they are cooked through and nicely browned.
7. While the lampreys are broiling, prepare the sauce:
   - Option 1 (with cullis): In a separate saucepan, brown the butter. Add a pinch of flour, the finely chopped mushrooms, chives, parsley, salt, pepper, anchovy, and capers. Cook for a few minutes until the mushrooms are tender.
   - Option 2 (simple sauce): In an earthen vessel or porringer, mix together the oil, vinegar, salt, pepper, mustard, finely chopped parsley, anchovy, and capers until well combined.
8. If using option 1 for the sauce, moisten it with fish broth and thicken it with a cullis (reduced fish stock). If using option 2, simply transfer the sauce mixture to a saucer.
9. Pour the sauce into a serving dish and arrange the broiled lampreys around it.
10. Serve the broiled lampreys hot with the sauce on the side.
