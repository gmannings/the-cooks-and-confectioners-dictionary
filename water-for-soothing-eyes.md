# Water for Soothing Eyes

## Description
This recipe is for a soothing eye wash made with Lapis Calaminaris (a type of powdered mineral) and white wine. It is meant to be used to refresh and cleanse the eyes.

## Ingredients:
- 1 pennyworth (approx. 1/4 teaspoon) of powdered Lapis Calaminaris
- 1 pint (approx. 473 ml) of white wine

## Instructions:
1. In a glass container with a tight-fitting lid, combine the powdered Lapis Calaminaris and white wine.
2. Close the container tightly and shake it to mix the ingredients.
3. Place the container in a sunny location, such as a windowsill, for two hours. If it is winter, place the container near a warm fire instead.
4. Shake the container two or three times during the two-hour period to ensure the ingredients are well combined.
5. After two hours, the eye wash is ready to use.
6. Before using, give the container a gentle shake to ensure the ingredients are evenly distributed.
7. Dip a clean feather into the eye wash.
8. Gently stroke the feather over the lashes of your eyes once or twice.
9. Repeat the process as needed, shaking the container before each use.

## Options and commentary
- If you cannot find Lapis Calaminaris, you can try using a small amount of powdered zinc oxide as a substitute.
- It is important to use a clean feather each time to avoid introducing any bacteria or dirt into the eye wash.
- If you experience any discomfort or irritation after using the eye wash, discontinue use and consult a healthcare professional.
