# Seasoned Cheese-cakes

## Description
Seasoned Cheese-cakes are a delicious and creamy dessert made with fresh milk curds, spices, sugar, and currants. The curds are flavored with cloves, mace, cinnamon, and a hint of rosewater, giving them a delightful aroma. These cheese-cakes are perfect for any occasion and are sure to be a crowd-pleaser.

## Ingredients:
- 1 gallon (3.8 liters) of fresh milk
- 1 spoonful of rennet
- 1/4 ounce (7 grams) of cloves, mace, and cinnamon (mixed and finely ground)
- A pinch of salt
- 1/2 pound (225 grams) of sugar
- A splash of rosewater
- 1/2 pint (240 milliliters) of Sack (a type of fortified wine, such as Sherry)
- 1/2 pound (225 grams) of melted butter
- 6 eggs (3 whole eggs and 3 egg whites)
- 1 pound (450 grams) of currants

## Instructions:
1. Warm the fresh milk from the cow, ensuring it is not too hot or too cold.
2. Add a spoonful of rennet to the warm milk and stir gently.
3. Allow the milk to sit undisturbed until it forms curds. This may take a few hours.
4. Once the curds have formed, strain them from the liquid (whey) using a cheesecloth or fine-mesh strainer.
5. Place the curds on a range or stovetop and rub them through with the back of a spoon until they become smooth and creamy.
6. In a separate bowl, combine the finely ground cloves, mace, and cinnamon with a pinch of salt.
7. Add the sugar, rosewater, Sack, and melted butter to the curds and mix well.
8. Beat in three whole eggs and three egg whites, ensuring they are well incorporated into the mixture.
9. Stir in the currants until evenly distributed throughout the mixture.
10. The seasoned cheese-cake mixture is now ready to use.
