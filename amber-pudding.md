# Amber Pudding

## Description
Amber Pudding is a rich and aromatic dessert made with almonds, sugar, and fragrant ingredients like Ambergreefe and Levant Musk. It was a popular dish in the 18th century and is still enjoyed today for its unique flavors.

## Options and commentary
- Instead of using the guts of a young hog, you can use sausage casings or synthetic casings.
- Ambergreefe and Levant Musk can be difficult to find and are not commonly used in modern cooking. You can omit these ingredients or substitute with a small amount of vanilla extract or other aromatic spices like cardamom or cinnamon.

## Ingredients:
- Sausage casings or synthetic casings
- 200g blanched almonds
- 500g lard
- 4 white loaves of bread
- 300g fine sugar
- 0.5g Ambergreefe (optional)
- 0.25g Levant Musk (optional)
- 60ml orange flower water

## Instructions:
1. Wash the sausage casings or synthetic casings thoroughly and set aside.

2. Blanch the almonds by placing them in boiling water for a few minutes, then drain and remove the skins. Set aside 150g of the blanched almonds and finely chop them. Keep the remaining 50g whole.

3. In a large bowl, combine the lard, chopped almonds, grated white bread, and fine sugar. Mix well until all the ingredients are evenly combined.

4. In a mortar and pestle, crush the Ambergreefe and Levant Musk together until they form a fine powder. Add the orange flower water to the mortar and mix well.

5. Add the Ambergreefe and Levant Musk mixture to the bowl with the other ingredients. Mix everything together until well combined.

6. Take the sausage casings or synthetic casings and carefully fill them with the mixture. Tie off the ends of the casings to secure the filling.

7. Place the filled casings in a steamer or a large pot with a steamer basket. Steam the puddings for about 1 hour, or until they are firm and cooked through.

8. Remove the puddings from the steamer and let them cool slightly before serving. They can be served warm or chilled.
