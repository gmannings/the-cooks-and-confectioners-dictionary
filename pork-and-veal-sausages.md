## Description
This recipe is for making sausages using a combination of pork and veal. The meat is finely chopped and mixed with spices, herbs, and breadcrumbs before being stuffed into casings. The sausages are then grilled on a gridiron. These sausages can be served as a side dish or used as a garnishing.
