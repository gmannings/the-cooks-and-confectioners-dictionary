# Sweet Marrow Pies

## Description
Sweet Marrow Pies are a delicious and indulgent dessert from the 18th century. They are made with a mixture of marrow bones, herbs, eggs, sugar, currants, rosewater, and nutmeg. The filling is then encased in puff pastry and fried until golden and crispy.

## Options and commentary
- Instead of marrow bones, you can use butter or vegetable shortening as a modern alternative.
- If you don't have winter savory or sweet marjoram, you can substitute with dried mixed herbs or any other herbs of your choice.
- You can adjust the amount of sugar and currants according to your taste preference.
- Instead of frying, you can also bake the pies in the oven at 180Â°C for about 20-25 minutes or until golden brown.

## Ingredients:
- 3 marrow bones (or 150g butter/vegetable shortening)
- 1 tsp thyme
- 1 tsp winter savory
- 1 tsp sweet marjoram
- 3 egg yolks
- 115g sugar
- 115g currants
- 1 tsp rosewater
- 1/4 tsp nutmeg
- Puff pastry
- Lard or vegetable shortening for frying

## Instructions:
1. Remove the marrow from the bones and finely chop it. If using butter or vegetable shortening, melt it and set aside.
2. In a mixing bowl, combine the chopped marrow (or melted butter/vegetable shortening), thyme, winter savory, sweet marjoram, egg yolks, sugar, currants, rosewater, and nutmeg. Mix well until all the ingredients are evenly incorporated.
3. Roll out the puff pastry on a lightly floured surface to a thickness of about 1/4 inch.
4. Cut the pastry into rounds or squares, depending on your preference and the size of your pies.
5. Spoon a generous amount of the filling onto one half of each pastry round or square, leaving a small border around the edges.
6. Fold the other half of the pastry over the filling and press the edges together to seal. You can use a fork to crimp the edges for a decorative touch.
7. Heat lard or vegetable shortening in a frying pan over medium heat.
8. Carefully place the pies into the hot fat and fry for about 3-4 minutes on each side, or until they are golden brown and crispy.
9. Remove the pies from the pan and drain on paper towels to remove any excess oil.
10. Serve the sweet marrow pies warm as a delightful dessert.
