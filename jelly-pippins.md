# Jelly Pippins

## Description
Jelly Pippins is a sweet and tangy jelly made from boiled and strained apples, flavored with citrus. It is a delightful spread that can be enjoyed on toast, scones, or used as a filling for pastries.

## Ingredients:
- 24 Pippin apples
- 3 liters of water
- 1-2 pieces of citron
- 1 kg double refined sugar
- Juice of lemons

## Instructions:
1. Wash the Pippin apples and peel them.
2. Cut the apples into quarters and remove the cores.
3. In a large pot, bring the water to a boil and add the apple quarters.
4. Boil the apples until they are very soft and the water has extracted all the flavor from the apples. This may take about 30-40 minutes.
5. Once the apples are cooked, remove them from the pot and place them in a hair sieve to strain out the liquid. Press down on the apples to extract as much liquid as possible.
6. Slice 1-2 pieces of citron and add them to the strained apple liquid. This will help to infuse the jelly with a subtle citrus flavor.
7. Allow the apple liquid to sit overnight to allow the flavors to meld.
8. The next day, measure the apple liquid and for every liter of liquid, add 1 kg of double refined sugar.
9. Place the pot with the apple liquid and sugar on the stove and bring it to a boil.
10. Once the mixture is boiling, add some slices of the cooked apple quarters, cut the wrong way to expose the kernels.
11. Boil the mixture rapidly until it reaches the desired consistency. This may take about 20-30 minutes. The jelly should coat the back of a spoon and have a thick, syrupy consistency.
12. While the jelly is still hot, pour it into sterilized glass jars.
13. Add the juice of lemons and thin slices of citron to each jar for added flavor and decoration.
14. Seal the jars tightly and allow the jelly to cool completely before storing in a cool, dark place.
