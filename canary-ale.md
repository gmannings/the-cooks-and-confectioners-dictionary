# Canary Ale

## Description
Canary Ale is a traditional 18th-century beverage made with a combination of ale, wine, and various spices. It is a flavorful and aromatic drink that was popular during that time period.

## Options and commentary
- Instead of a young cock, you can use chicken or turkey as a substitute.
- If you cannot find Canary wine, you can use a dry white wine as a substitute.
- Adjust the amount of spices according to your taste preferences.

## Ingredients:
- 1 young chicken or turkey
- 2 liters of Canary wine (or dry white wine)

## Instructions:
1. Parboil the young chicken or turkey until cooked through. Remove the skin and pound the meat in a mortar until all the bones are broken.

3. The next morning, add the ale to the container.
4. Add the raisins, dates, whole cloves, ground cloves, and sliced nutmeg to the container.
5. Close the container tightly and let it stand for a week to allow the flavors to meld.
6. After a week, strain the mixture through a fine-mesh sieve to remove any solids.
7. Pour the liquid into bottles, leaving some headspace.
8. Add a lump of fine sugar to each bottle.
9. Seal the bottles tightly and let them sit for eight to ten days to carbonate.
10. Once the ale is carbonated, it is ready to drink.
