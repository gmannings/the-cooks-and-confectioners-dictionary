# Paste of Green Peaches

## Description
This recipe is for making a paste of green peaches, which can be used as a sweet spread or filling for pastries. The peaches are prepared by boiling them until they become soft, then they are passed through a sieve to create a smooth marmalade. The marmalade is then dried over the fire until it begins to stick to the pan. Sugar is boiled until it becomes cracked, and then an equal weight of this sugar is added to the marmalade. The mixture is simmered together before being shaped and dried in a stove or oven. Once dry, the paste can be stored in boxes for future use.

## Ingredients:
- Green peaches
- Sugar

## Instructions:
1. Prepare the green peaches by cleaning and peeling them according to the instructions for preserving green peaches.
2. Boil the prepared peaches until they become very soft.
3. Drain the peaches and pass them through a sieve to create a smooth marmalade.
4. Transfer the marmalade to a pan and dry it over low heat, stirring constantly with a spatula to prevent any moisture from remaining. Continue drying until the marmalade begins to stick to the pan.
5. In a separate pan, boil sugar until it becomes cracked.
6. Add an equal weight of the cracked sugar to the marmalade and mix well.
7. Simmer the mixture together for a while to combine the flavors.
8. Take spoonfuls of the marmalade and shape them onto slates or into molds.
9. Place the shaped marmalade in a stove or oven with a good fire and dry them overnight.
10. The next day, turn the dried marmalade and continue drying until it is sufficiently dry.
11. Transfer the dried paste to boxes for storage.
