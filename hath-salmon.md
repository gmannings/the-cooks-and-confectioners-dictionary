## Ingredients:
- 1 part of a salmon (jole, rand, or tail)
- Fresh eel (optional)
- Salt
- Pepper
- Cloves (ground)
- Mace (ground)
- Sweet herbs (such as parsley, thyme, or dill)
- Claret wine
- Blanched chestnuts
- Gooseberries, barberries, or grapes
- Sippets (toasted bread)
- Butter
- Grated bread (for garnish)
- Oysters (for garnish)
- Cockles or prawns (for garnish)

## Instructions:
1. In a large pot, bring water to a gentle simmer. Add the salmon and fresh eel (if using) to the pot and cook until the salmon is cooked through and easily flakes with a fork. This should take about 10-15 minutes.
2. Remove the salmon and eel from the pot and let them cool slightly. Once cooled, remove the skin from the salmon and discard. Finely mince the salmon and eel.
3. In a pipkin or small saucepan, combine the minced salmon and eel. Season with salt, pepper, ground cloves, ground mace, and chopped sweet herbs. Mix well to combine.
4. Pour in enough claret wine to cover the minced salmon and eel mixture. Add the blanched chestnuts and your choice of gooseberries, barberries, or grapes.
5. Place the pipkin or saucepan over medium heat and bring the mixture to a simmer. Allow it to simmer for about 15-20 minutes, or until the flavors have melded together and the mixture has thickened slightly.
6. While the mixture is simmering, prepare the sippets by toasting slices of bread until golden brown. Set aside.
7. Once the minced salmon and eel mixture is ready, remove it from the heat. Arrange the sippets on a serving dish and spoon the mixture over the sippets.
8. In a separate small saucepan, melt some butter. Once melted, beat the butter until it becomes frothy. Drizzle the beaten butter over the minced salmon and eel mixture.
9. Garnish the dish with grated bread, fried oysters, cockles, or prawns, according to your preference.
