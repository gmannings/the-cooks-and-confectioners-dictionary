# Lemon Biscuits

## Description
Lemon Biscuits are light and delicate cookies with a hint of citrus flavor. They are made with a combination of eggs, flour, sugar, and lemon peel. These biscuits are perfect for enjoying with a cup of tea or coffee.

## Ingredients:
- 8 eggs
- 8 eggs (whites only)
- Fine baked flour (equal weight to the 6 eggs)
- Fine powdered sugar (equal weight to the 6 eggs)
- Green lemon peel (powdered)

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F) and line a baking sheet with parchment paper.

2. Separate the eggs, placing the whites of 8 eggs in a mixing bowl and setting aside the yolks.

3. Beat the egg whites until they form stiff peaks, creating a strong "snow" consistency.

4. In a separate bowl, combine the fine baked flour and powdered sugar, using the weight of 6 eggs as a guide.

5. Add the powdered green lemon peel to the flour mixture and mix well.

6. Gradually add some of the sugar to the beaten egg whites, beating continuously.

7. Add the egg yolks to the mixture and continue to whip until well combined.

8. Slowly incorporate the flour mixture into the egg mixture, folding gently until fully combined.

9. Spoon the batter onto the prepared baking sheet, forming biscuits in any desired shape.

10. Optional: Dust the biscuits with powdered sugar for a decorative touch.

11. Bake the biscuits in the preheated oven for about 10-12 minutes, or until they are lightly golden around the edges.

12. Remove the biscuits from the oven and carefully cut them off from the parchment paper.
