# Dzel a Pike a Cubilo, the Dutch Way

## Description
This recipe is for preparing a Pike fish in the Dutch style. The fish is scaled, gutted, and cut into slices. It is then boiled in seasoned water and served with a sauce made from melted butter. 

## Options and commentary
- Instead of a whole Pike, you can use Pike fillets or any other firm white fish fillets.
- The sauce can be made with either oiled butter or drawn butter. Drawn butter is made by melting butter and adding a spoonful of water to achieve a creamy consistency.
- Lemon juice can be added to the sauce for a tangy flavor.

## Ingredients:
- 1 whole Pike (or Pike fillets)
- Salt
- 1/4 cup vinegar
- 1/2 cup butter
- 1 tablespoon water
- Lemon juice (optional)

## Instructions:
1. Scale the Pike and remove the guts. Rinse it thoroughly.
2. Cut off the head of the Pike.
3. Cut the Pike into slices about an inch thick, trying to cut through the joints. When you reach the tail, cut through the bone, but leave the fish whole on the underside so that it remains intact.
4. Place the sliced Pike into a pan of cold water.
5. Fill a pot with water and bring it to a boil. Season the boiling water with salt.
6. Once the water is boiling, pour in the vinegar and skim off any impurities that rise to the surface.
7. Cut the Pike's head in half and add it, along with the tail, to the boiling water. Let them cook for about 5-6 minutes before adding the slices.
8. Remove the gall from the milt (the fish's reproductive organ) and add the milt to the boiling water.
9. Boil the fish for about 15 minutes.
10. Remove the fish from the water and let it drain.
11. Arrange the head and tail in the center of a serving dish and place the slices around them. Place some sippets (small pieces of toasted bread) under the slices.
12. For the sauce, melt the butter gently over low heat. Stir it with a ladle until it is melted and well combined.
13. Pour the melted butter over the fish, making sure to coat all the slices.
14. Optionally, squeeze in some lemon juice to the sauce for added flavor.
15. Serve the dish hot.

## Cooking time
Approximately 30 minutes.
