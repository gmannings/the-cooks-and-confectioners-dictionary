# Sweet-meats of Apples

## Description
This recipe is for making sweet-meats (candied fruit) using apples. The apples are first made into a jelly, and then sliced and preserved in a sweet syrup. The sweet-meats are flavored with lemon juice, orange juice, mace, cloves, and a hint of musk.

## Ingredients:
- Soft and pleasant apples
- Sugar
- Juice of lemons
- Juice of oranges
- Mace
- Cloves

## Instructions:
1. Make a jelly by cooking the soft and pleasant apples until they are soft and mushy. Strain the cooked apples to obtain a smooth jelly. Set aside.
2. Cut the remaining apples into round slices.
3. Place the sliced apples in a glass jar or pot and let them stand for six days to allow them to partially dry out.
4. After six days, add a quarter pound of sugar for each pound of apple slices. Do not break the apples any further.
5. Season the apple slices with the juice of lemons and oranges. Add mace and cloves for flavor.
6. If desired, add a small amount of musk for a subtle perfume.
7. Mix everything together gently to ensure the sugar and flavorings are evenly distributed.
8. Cover the jar or pot and let the sweet-meats sit for a few more days to allow the flavors to meld together.
9. The sweet-meats of apples are now ready to be enjoyed.

## Cooking time
