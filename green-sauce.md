# Green Sauce

## Description
Green Sauce is a tangy and flavorful sauce that pairs well with lamb. It is made by pounding green wheat in a mortar along with a crust of bread, seasoning it with salt and pepper, and then moistening it with veal gravy and vinegar. The mixture is then strained to create a smooth sauce.

## Ingredients:
- 100g green wheat
- 1 crust of bread
- Salt, to taste
- Pepper, to taste
- 200ml veal gravy
- 50ml vinegar

## Instructions:
1. In a mortar, pound the green wheat and crust of bread until they form a coarse paste.
2. Season the paste with salt and pepper, adjusting the amount to your taste.
3. Gradually add the veal gravy and vinegar to the paste, stirring well to combine.
4. Continue to add the veal gravy and vinegar until the mixture reaches a moist and pourable consistency.
5. Place a fine-mesh strainer over a bowl or container.
6. Pour the sauce mixture into the strainer, using the back of a spoon to press it through and remove any lumps.
7. Discard any solids left in the strainer.
8. Transfer the strained sauce to a serving dish or container.
9. The green sauce is now ready to be served with lamb or any other dish of your choice.
