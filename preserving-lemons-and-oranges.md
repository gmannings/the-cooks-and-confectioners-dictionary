# Preserving Lemons and Oranges

## Description
This recipe provides a method for preserving lemons and oranges using sand. Preserving citrus fruits in this way allows them to be stored for a long period of time without spoiling.

## Ingredients:
- Fine sand
- Lemons or oranges

## Instructions:
1. Preheat oven to a low temperature (around 150°C).
2. Spread the fine sand on a baking sheet and place it in the oven for about 30 minutes to dry it thoroughly. Let the sand cool completely before using.
3. Take an earthenware vessel or a glass jar with a tight-fitting lid.
4. Start by creating a layer of sand at the bottom of the vessel, about 1 inch thick.
5. Place the lemons or oranges on top of the sand layer, making sure the stalks are facing downwards. Make sure the fruits do not touch each other.
6. Cover the fruits with another layer of sand, about 2-3 inches thick.
7. Repeat the process of layering the fruits and sand until the vessel is filled, making sure to finish with a layer of sand on top.
8. Close the vessel tightly with the lid.
9. Store the vessel in a cool place, such as a cellar or a refrigerator, where the temperature is consistently cool (around 10-15°C).
10. The preserved lemons or oranges can be kept for up to a year.

## Options and commentary
- It is important to use fine sand for this method of preservation. Coarse sand may damage the fruits.
- Make sure the sand is completely dry before using it. Moisture can cause the fruits to spoil.
- The vessel or jar should have a tight-fitting lid to prevent air and moisture from entering.
- It is recommended to check the preserved fruits periodically for any signs of spoilage. If any fruit appears moldy or has an off smell, discard it immediately.

## Cooking time
- Preparing the sand: 30 minutes
- Preserving the fruits: 1 day (to allow the sand to settle and the flavors to develop)
