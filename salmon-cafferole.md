# Salmon Cafferole

## Description
This recipe is for a delicious and elegant dish featuring a tail-piece of salmon. The salmon is scaled and the skin is loosened so that it can be easily removed. The void space left by removing the fillets is then filled with a fish-farce (a mixture of fish, herbs, butter, and bread) or with a mixture of fine herbs, butter, and bread. The skin is then placed back on the tail-piece and the entire dish is breaded and baked in the oven with white wine, salt, thyme, chibbol (green onion), bay leaf, and lemon peel. Once baked, a flavorful ragout is poured over the salmon and it is garnished before serving.

## Options and commentary
- Instead of using a tail-piece of salmon, you can use salmon fillets or a whole salmon.
- The fish-farce can be made with any white fish such as cod, haddock, or sole.
- The herbs used in the filling can be parsley, dill, chives, or a combination of your choice.
- The ragout can be made with a variety of ingredients such as mushrooms, tomatoes, or a creamy sauce.
- The garnish can be fresh herbs, lemon slices, or edible flowers.
