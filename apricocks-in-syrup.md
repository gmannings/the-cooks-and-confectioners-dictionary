# Apricocks in Syrup

## Description
Apricocks in Syrup is a sweet and tangy dessert made with apricots cooked in a sugar syrup. The apricots are tender and infused with the flavors of the syrup. This recipe requires a few days to prepare as the apricots need to soak in the syrup and then dry.

## Ingredients:
- Apricots
- Fine sugar
- Water

## Instructions:
1. Start by preparing the apricots. Peel the apricots and remove the stones.
2. Weigh the peeled apricots and take an equal amount of fine sugar.
3. In a skillet, combine two-thirds of the sugar with enough water to wet it. 
4. Bring the mixture to a boil, skimming off any impurities that rise to the surface.
5. Gently place the apricots into the boiling syrup. 
6. Cook the apricots gently, occasionally pricking them with a bodkin (a small pointed tool) to allow the syrup to penetrate.
7. After the apricots have cooked for a while and become tender, add the remaining sugar to the syrup.
8. Continue cooking the apricots until they are fully tender.
9. Once the apricots are cooked, remove them from the syrup and place them in a colander to drain.
10. Transfer the syrup to an earthen dish and place the apricots back into the syrup.
11. Allow the apricots to sit in the syrup for two to three days, turning them once a day.
12. If the apricots shrink or become tough during this time, briefly boil them again in the syrup and then remove them as before.
13. After the soaking period, place the apricots on glass plates and set them in a stove or a warm place for a day or two to dry.
14. Once the apricots have dried slightly, transfer them to clean plates.
15. If the syrup around the apricots is sticky or tough, wash them in hot water and then place them on fresh plates to dry.
