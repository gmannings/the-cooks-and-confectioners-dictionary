## Description
This recipe is for a classic dish of stewed pike with a flavorful white wine sauce. The pike is cooked gently in white wine, seasoned with spices, and finished with a rich butter and egg sauce. It is a delicious and elegant dish that can be served as a main course.

## Ingredients:
- 1 whole pike, cleaned and scaled
- 500 ml white wine

- 4 blades of mace
- 50 g butter
