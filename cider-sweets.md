# Cider Sweets

## Description
Cider Sweets are a type of sweet confectionery made with a mixture of egg whites, water, and sugar. The mixture is boiled down to a syrup-like consistency, resulting in a sweet and chewy treat.

## Options and commentary
- This recipe makes a large quantity of Cider Sweets. You can adjust the quantities according to the same proportion to make a smaller batch.
- It is important to keep an eye on the mixture while it is boiling to prevent it from boiling too high and overflowing.

## Ingredients:
- 40 egg whites
- 8 liters of water
- 50 kg of sugar

## Instructions:
1. In a large bowl, beat the egg whites until they form a glair-like consistency.
2. In a large pot, combine the beaten egg whites and water.
3. Add half of the sugar to the egg-water mixture and stir until the sugar is dissolved.
4. Place the pot over a gentle fire and stir continuously to prevent the mixture from sticking to the bottom of the pot.
5. Gradually add more of the egg-water mixture, about 1 liter at a time, stirring well after each addition.
6. Skim off any foam that rises to the surface of the mixture.
7. Once the foam stops rising and the sweets become clear, add the remaining water to the pot.
8. Continue boiling the mixture until it reaches the consistency of a syrup. This may take some time, so be patient and keep stirring.
9. Once the mixture has thickened to a syrup-like consistency, remove it from the heat and let it cool slightly.
10. While the mixture is still warm, pour it into molds or onto a greased baking sheet to shape the sweets.
11. Allow the Cider Sweets to cool and set completely before removing them from the molds or cutting them into desired shapes.

## Cooking time
Approximately 2-3 hours, depending on the heat of the fire and the desired consistency of the syrup.
