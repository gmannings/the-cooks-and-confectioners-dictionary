# Rice Cream

## Description
Rice Cream is a creamy and sweet dessert made with rice flour, cream, sugar, and eggs. It has a smooth and velvety texture with a delicate rice flavor.

## Ingredients:
- 2 liters of cream
- 4 handfuls of rice flour
- 225 grams of sugar
- 2 egg yolks
- 1 tablespoon of rose water

## Instructions:
1. In a large bowl, mix together the rice flour and sugar until well combined.
2. Pour the cream into a saucepan and heat it over medium heat until it starts to simmer.
3. Gradually add the rice flour and sugar mixture to the simmering cream, stirring constantly to prevent lumps from forming.
4. In a separate bowl, whisk together the egg yolks and rose water until well combined.
5. Slowly pour the egg yolk mixture into the cream mixture, stirring continuously.
6. Continue cooking the mixture over low heat, stirring constantly, until it thickens to a custard-like consistency. This should take about 10-15 minutes.
7. Remove the saucepan from the heat and let the rice cream cool to room temperature.
8. Once cooled, transfer the rice cream to individual serving dishes or a large serving bowl.
9. Cover the dishes or bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 2 hours, or until the rice cream is chilled and set.
10. Serve the rice cream chilled, garnished with a sprinkle of cinnamon or grated nutmeg if desired.
