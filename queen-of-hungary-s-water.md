# Queen of Hungary's Water

## Description
Queen of Hungary's Water is a traditional herbal distillation made from rosemary flowers and spirit of wine. It is believed to have various skincare and health benefits.

## Ingredients:
- 4 pounds of rosemary flowers
- 3 quarts of spirit of wine (high-proof alcohol)

## Instructions:
1. Gather rosemary flowers in the morning, about three to four hours after sunrise.
2. Place the rosemary flowers in a large pot or cucurbit.
3. Add the spirit of wine to the pot, making sure it is well rectified (high-proof).
4. Press the flowers down into the pot to ensure they are fully submerged in the spirit of wine.
5. Cover the pot with its lid and an alembic (distillation apparatus).
6. Seal the pot and alembic tightly using a paste made from flour and water, and secure it further with paper.
7. Place the pot in a sand-heat, which is a gentle and consistent heat source.
8. Attach a receiver to the alembic to collect the distilled liquid.
9. Leave the pot undisturbed in the sand-heat overnight.
10. The next morning, distill the mixture with a gentle fire. Make sure the head of the alembic remains cool while the spirit distills.
11. To speed up the distillation process, you can cover the head of the alembic with a linen cloth soaked in cold water. Repeat this step several times.
12. Continue distilling until you have collected approximately two quarts of the spirit.
13. Once the distillation is complete, remove the pot from the heat source and carefully unseal the pot and alembic.
14. Transfer the distilled spirit into bottles and seal them tightly.
15. Press and strain the remaining liquid from the bottom of the pot.
16. Clarify the liquid by removing any impurities.
17. Return the clarified liquid to the pot and distill it again until it thickens to the consistency of honey or syrup.
18. Transfer the thickened liquid into a glazed pipkin or small pot.
19. Boil the liquid over a low heat until it reaches the thickness of an ordinary extract.
20. Store the last spirit (distilled in step 12) in a separate bottle.
