# Elder-leaf Face Wash

## Description
This recipe is a traditional method for reducing freckles and skin discoloration. It involves distilling elder leaves and using the resulting water as a face wash. The face wash is applied in the morning and evening, and left to dry naturally on the skin.

## Ingredients:
- Elder leaves
- Water

## Instructions:
1. Gather a handful of fresh elder leaves.
2. Rinse the leaves under cold water to remove any dirt or debris.
3. Place the elder leaves in a pot and add enough water to cover them.
4. Bring the water to a boil over medium heat.
5. Once the water reaches a boil, reduce the heat to low and simmer for 15 minutes.
6. Remove the pot from the heat and allow the water to cool completely.
7. Strain the water to remove the elder leaves, and transfer it to a clean container.
8. To use the face wash, dip a clean sponge or cloth into the elder leaf water.
9. Gently wash your face with the soaked sponge, focusing on areas with freckles or skin discoloration.
10. Allow the face wash to air dry on your skin, without rinsing it off.
11. Repeat this process every morning and evening for best results.

## Options and commentary

- The face wash can be stored in the refrigerator for up to one week.
- It is important to avoid getting the elder leaf water in your eyes, as it may cause irritation.
- This method may not work for everyone, and individual results may vary.
