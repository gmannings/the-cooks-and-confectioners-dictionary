# Buttered Crabs

## Description
Buttered Crabs is a dish made with boiled crab meat mixed with a flavorful sauce made from egg yolks, claret wine, vinegar, sugar, and cinnamon. The mixture is then cooked with fresh butter and served hot.

## Ingredients:
- 4 crabs
- 3-4 hard-boiled eggs
- 100 ml claret wine
- 50 ml vinegar
- 2 tbsp sugar
- 1 tsp ground cinnamon
- 100 g unsalted butter

## Instructions:
1. Boil the crabs in a large pot of salted water until they are cooked through. This usually takes about 15-20 minutes. Remove the crabs from the pot and let them cool.
2. Once the crabs are cool enough to handle, remove the meat from their bodies. Discard the shells and set the crab meat aside.
3. In a bowl, mash the hard-boiled eggs using a fork until they are finely crumbled.
4. Add the crumbled eggs to a saucepan along with the claret wine, vinegar, sugar, and ground cinnamon. Stir well to combine.
5. Place the saucepan over medium heat and cook the mixture for about 5 minutes, stirring constantly, until it thickens slightly.
6. Add the crab meat to the saucepan and stir to coat it evenly with the sauce.
7. Cut the unsalted butter into small pieces and add it to the saucepan. Stir well to melt the butter and incorporate it into the sauce.
8. Reduce the heat to low and let the mixture simmer for about 15 minutes, stirring occasionally, to allow the flavors to meld together.
9. Remove the saucepan from the heat and transfer the buttered crabs to a serving dish.
10. Serve the buttered crabs hot, as an appetizer or main course.

## Cooking time
Approximately 40-45 minutes.
