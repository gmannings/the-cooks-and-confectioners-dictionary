# Dzel's Pigs Petty-toes a la Sainte Menchout

## Description
Dzel's Pigs Petty-toes a la Sainte Menchout is a dish made with pig's trotters (also known as pig's feet) that are braised and then broiled. The trotters are first divided in half and tied together. They are then layered with bacon and herbs in a stew-pan or pot. The dish is slow-cooked for several hours and then cooled, breaded, and broiled before serving.

## Ingredients:
- 4 pig's trotters (pig's feet)
- 8 slices of bacon
- Fresh herbs (such as thyme, rosemary, and parsley)
- 1 quart (950 ml) white wine
- 1 glass of spirit of wine (such as brandy or cognac)
- 2 bay leaves
- 1 teaspoon coriander seeds
- 1 teaspoon anise seeds
- A small amount of quicksilver (mercury) (Note: Mercury is toxic and should not be used in cooking. Omit this ingredient.)

## Instructions:
1. Start by preparing the pig's trotters. Clean them thoroughly and divide each trotter in half. Tie each half together with kitchen twine to keep them intact during cooking.

2. In a stew-pan or pot, lay a layer of bacon slices on the bottom. Place a layer of pig's trotters on top of the bacon, followed by a sprinkle of fresh herbs.

3. Repeat the layering process, alternating between bacon, pig's trotters, and herbs, until all the trotters have been used. Make sure the top layer is bacon.

4. Pour the white wine and spirit of wine over the trotters. Add the bay leaves, coriander seeds, and anise seeds. Do not add the quicksilver.

5. Cover the stew-pan or pot with a lid that fits tightly. Line the edges of the pot with strong paper to create a seal. This will help retain the moisture and flavors during cooking.

6. Place the stew-pan or pot between two fires or on a stove with low heat. The fires should be gentle to allow the trotters to stew slowly. Cook the trotters for 10 to 12 hours, checking occasionally to ensure they are simmering gently.

7. Once the trotters are cooked, remove them from the stew-pan or pot and allow them to cool.

8. Preheat the grill or broiler.

9. Once the trotters have cooled, remove the kitchen twine and bread them neatly. This can be done by coating them in breadcrumbs or flour.

10. Place the breaded trotters on a preheated grill or under the broiler. Cook them until they are golden brown and crispy on the outside.

11. Serve the Dzel's Pigs Petty-toes a la Sainte Menchout hot as an appetizer or as part of a main course.
