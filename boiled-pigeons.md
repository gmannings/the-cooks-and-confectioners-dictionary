# Boiled Pigeons

## Description
This recipe involves boiling pigeons and serving them with a flavorful sauce. The pigeons are stuffed with parsley and butter, then boiled until cooked. The sauce is made with butter, salt, pepper, spinach, rosemary, thyme, parsley, egg yolk, and verjuice. The dish is served with sippets (small pieces of toasted bread) and the sauce poured over the pigeons.

## Options and commentary
- Instead of pigeons, you can use chicken or Cornish game hens as a modern alternative.
- Verjuice is a sour juice made from unripe grapes. If you can't find verjuice, you can substitute it with lemon juice or white wine vinegar.

## Ingredients:
- 2 pigeons (or chicken/Cornish game hens)
- 2 tablespoons butter
- Salt, to taste
- 1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
- 1 cup spinach, chopped
- 1 teaspoon fresh rosemary, chopped
- 1 teaspoon fresh thyme, chopped
- 1 tablespoon fresh parsley, chopped
- 1 egg yolk
- 2 tablespoons verjuice (or lemon juice/white wine vinegar)
- Sippets (small pieces of toasted bread)

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F).
2. Clean the pigeons thoroughly and remove any giblets. Pat them dry with paper towels.
3. In a small bowl, mix together the chopped parsley and butter.
4. Stuff each pigeon with the parsley and butter mixture.
5. Place the stuffed pigeons in an oven-safe pot or Dutch oven.
6. Add enough water to the pot to cover the pigeons.
7. Bring the water to a boil over medium-high heat.
8. Once boiling, reduce the heat to low and simmer the pigeons for about 45 minutes to 1 hour, or until cooked through. Skim off any foam or impurities that rise to the surface.
9. While the pigeons are cooking, prepare the sauce. In a separate bowl, whisk together the egg yolk and verjuice (or lemon juice/white wine vinegar) until well combined.
10. In a saucepan, melt the butter over medium heat.
11. Add the chopped spinach, rosemary, thyme, and parsley to the saucepan. Cook for 2-3 minutes, until the spinach is wilted.
12. Pour the egg yolk and verjuice mixture into the saucepan. Stir well to combine.
13. Cook the sauce over low heat, stirring constantly, until it thickens slightly. Do not let it boil.
14. Remove the cooked pigeons from the pot and place them on a serving dish.
15. Arrange sippets around the pigeons on the dish.
16. Pour the sauce over the pigeons and sippets.
17. Serve hot.
