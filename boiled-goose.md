# Boiled Goose

## Description
This recipe is for a traditional boiled goose dish. The goose is simmered in a flavorful broth with onions, cloves, white wine, raisins, currants, and a bundle of herbs. It is then served on sippets (toasted bread) and garnished with slices of lemon and barberries.

## Ingredients:
- 1 goose
- Water or strong broth
- Salt
- Pepper
- 3-4 onions, sliced

## Instructions:
1. In a large pot, add enough water or strong broth to fully submerge the goose.
