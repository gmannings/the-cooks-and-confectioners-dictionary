# Lamb Pie

## Description
A savory pie filled with layers of seasoned lamb slices, marrow, dried fruits, and spices. The pie is then topped with a sweet and tangy sauce made with white wine, verjuice, and eggs.

## Ingredients:
- 500g lamb, thinly sliced
- Salt, to taste
- Pepper, to taste
- 1/4 teaspoon ground cloves
- 1/4 teaspoon ground mace
- 1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg
- 1 teaspoon sugar
- 50g marrow, diced
- 50g butter, diced
- 50g raisins, soaked in warm water and drained
- 50g currants
- 50g dates, sliced
- 50g skirrets, boiled and blanched
- 25g dried citron, diced
- 25g candied lemon peel, diced
- 1/2 teaspoon large mace
- 25g preserved barberries
- 1 lemon, sliced
- 1 pre-made pie crust
- 100ml white wine
- 50ml verjuice
- 1 tablespoon sugar
- 3-4 egg yolks

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F).
2. In a bowl, combine the lamb slices with salt, pepper, ground cloves, ground mace, ground nutmeg, and sugar. Mix well to coat the lamb evenly with the spices.
3. Layer the seasoned lamb slices in the pre-made pie crust, alternating with layers of diced marrow, diced butter, soaked raisins, currants, sliced dates, boiled and blanched skirrets, diced dried citron, diced candied lemon peel, large mace, preserved barberries, and lemon slices.
4. Once all the layers are added, cover the pie with the remaining pie crust and seal the edges.
5. Place the pie in the preheated oven and bake for about 1 hour, or until the crust is golden brown and the lamb is cooked through.
6. While the pie is baking, prepare the sauce. In a small saucepan, combine the white wine, verjuice, and sugar. Place the saucepan over medium heat and stir until the mixture begins to thicken.
7. In a separate bowl, whisk the egg yolks. Slowly pour the thickened wine mixture into the bowl with the egg yolks, whisking constantly to prevent curdling.
8. Once the pie is baked, remove it from the oven and carefully pour the sauce into the pie through a funnel, distributing it evenly.
9. Give the pie a gentle shake or two to ensure the sauce is distributed throughout the layers.
10. Sprinkle some sugar over the top of the pie.
11. Serve the lamb pie hot.
