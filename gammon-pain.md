# Gammon Pain

## Description
Gammon Pain is a dish made with slices of raw gammon that are cooked in a stew-pan with lard until browned. They are then simmered in a flavorful gravy with herbs, spices, lemon slices, bread crumbs, and vinegar. The dish is served on a French loaf that has been hollowed out, toasted, and filled with the ragout. It is garnished with capon livers wrapped in veal caul.

## Ingredients:
- Slices of raw gammon
- Lard
- Flour
- Good gravy
- Bunch of chives
- Sweet herbs (such as parsley, thyme, and rosemary)
- Cloves

## Instructions:
1. Take the slices of raw gammon and beat them well.

3. Toss the gammon slices in the stew-pan until they are browned.
4. Transfer the gammon slices to a chafing dish.
5. Sprinkle a little flour over the gammon slices and stir with a spoon to bring them to a brown color.
6. Once the gammon slices are browned, add some good gravy to the chafing dish.
7. Add a bunch of chives, sweet herbs, cloves, a clove of garlic, slices of lemon, crusts of bread, and a little vinegar to the chafing dish.
8. If the gammon slices are not thickened enough, add a little bread cullis (a thick sauce made from bread).
9. Cut a French loaf through the middle, keeping both the upper and under crusts whole.
10. Remove all the crumb from the French loaf and toast the crusts before the fire or in an oven until they are browned.
11. Join the two crusts together to form a hollowed-out loaf.
12. Soak the crusts with the sauce from the chafing dish.
13. Transfer the ragout (gammon slices and sauce) into the hollowed-out French loaf.
