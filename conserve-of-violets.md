# Conserve of Violets

## Description
This recipe is for making a sweet violet preserve called "Conserve of Violets." It involves boiling sugar to a specific degree, then adding crushed violets to give it both the color and taste of violets. The mixture is then poured into molds and left to set before being removed and stored for later use.

## Ingredients:
- 500g sugar
- Fresh violets (enough to give the desired color and taste)

## Instructions:
1. In a saucepan, bring the sugar to a boil over medium heat, stirring constantly until it reaches the fourth degree of sugar boiling, also known as "feathered." This is when the sugar syrup forms thin threads that resemble feathers when dropped from a spoon.
2. While the sugar is boiling, pick the violets, removing any stems or leaves. Place the violets in a mortar and crush them into a paste.
3. Once the sugar has reached the desired degree, add the crushed violets to the saucepan. Stir well to combine, making sure the violets are evenly distributed throughout the syrup.
4. Continue to cook the mixture, stirring constantly, until a small ice forms on the top of the syrup. This indicates that the conserve is ready.
5. Quickly pour the hot conserve into paper molds or any other suitable molds of your choice. Fill the molds to the desired level, leaving some space for the conserve to expand as it cools.
6. Allow the conserve to set for at least two hours.
7. After the conserve has set, remove it from the molds and transfer it to airtight containers for storage.
