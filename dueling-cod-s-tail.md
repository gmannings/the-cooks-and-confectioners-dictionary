# Dueling Cod's Tail

## Description
This recipe involves preparing a cod's tail by removing the skin, filling it with a fish farce (a mixture of fish, herbs, breadcrumbs, and butter), and then reattaching the skin. The tail is then breaded and baked in the oven to give it a golden color. A ragout is made to accompany the dish, and it is garnished with appropriate garnitures before serving.

## Options and commentary
- Instead of cod's tail, you can use any firm white fish fillets.
- The fish farce can be made with a combination of fish, herbs, breadcrumbs, and butter. You can use any white fish, such as cod or haddock, for the farce.
- The ragout can be made with a variety of vegetables and herbs, depending on personal preference.
- The garnitures can include fresh herbs, lemon wedges, or any other decorative elements.

## Ingredients:
- 1 cod's tail (or firm white fish fillets)
- Fish farce:
  - 200g white fish fillets
  - 1 tablespoon chopped fresh herbs (such as parsley, dill, or chives)
  - 50g breadcrumbs
  - 50g butter, softened
- Breading:
  - 50g breadcrumbs
- Ragout:
  - Assorted vegetables (such as carrots, peas, and mushrooms)
  - 1 tablespoon butter
  - 1 tablespoon flour
  - 250ml fish or vegetable broth
- Garnitures:
  - Fresh herbs
  - Lemon wedges

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 180°C.
2. Scale the cod's tail and loosen the skin so that it can be easily removed from the flesh.
3. Carefully remove the fillets from the cod's tail, taking care not to break them.
4. Prepare the fish farce by combining the white fish fillets, chopped fresh herbs, breadcrumbs, and softened butter in a food processor. Blend until well combined and smooth.
5. Fill the void space left by removing the fillets with the fish farce. Press it firmly to ensure it fills the space evenly.
6. Place the skin back onto the tail, covering the fish farce completely.
7. Neatly bread the cod's tail by coating it with breadcrumbs, pressing gently to adhere.
8. Place the breaded cod's tail on a baking sheet and transfer it to the preheated oven.
9. Bake for approximately 20-25 minutes, or until the breading is golden and crispy.
10. While the cod's tail is baking, prepare the ragout. Chop the assorted vegetables into small, bite-sized pieces.
11. In a saucepan, melt the butter over medium heat. Add the chopped vegetables and sauté until they are tender.
12. Sprinkle the flour over the vegetables and stir well to coat.
13. Gradually pour in the fish or vegetable broth, stirring constantly to prevent lumps from forming.
14. Cook the ragout over medium heat until it thickens and reaches a sauce-like consistency.
15. Once the cod's tail is cooked, remove it from the oven and let it rest for a few minutes.
16. To serve, place the cod's tail on a serving platter and spoon the ragout around it. Garnish with fresh herbs and lemon wedges.
