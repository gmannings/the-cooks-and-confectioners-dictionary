# Quince Pudding

## Description
This recipe is for a traditional 18th-century Quince Pudding. It is a sweet and creamy dessert made with quince pulp, sugar, cinnamon, ginger, egg yolks, and cream. The pudding is boiled and then served warm.

## Options and commentary
- Quinces may not be easily available in some regions. You can substitute with other tart fruits like apples or pears.
- If you prefer a lighter version, you can use milk instead of cream.
- Adjust the amount of sugar and spices according to your taste preferences.

## Ingredients:
- 2 pounds (900 grams) quince pulp (or substitute with apples or pears)
- 1 pound (450 grams) fine powdered sugar
- 1/4 ounce (7 grams) ground cinnamon
- 1/4 ounce (7 grams) ground ginger
- 16 egg yolks
- 2 quarts (2 liters) cream (or substitute with milk)
- Flour, for dusting the cloth

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 350°F (180°C).
2. Peel and core the quinces. Cut them into small pieces and cook them in a saucepan with a little water until they are soft and can be easily mashed. Mash the cooked quinces into a smooth pulp.
3. In a large mixing bowl, combine the quince pulp, powdered sugar, cinnamon, and ginger. Mix well.
4. In a separate bowl, beat the egg yolks until they are well combined.
5. Add the beaten egg yolks to the quince mixture and mix thoroughly.
6. Gradually pour in the cream (or milk) while continuously stirring the mixture.
7. Prepare a cloth by dusting it with flour.
8. Pour the pudding mixture onto the cloth and tie it securely with kitchen twine, leaving some space for the pudding to expand.
9. Place the pudding in a large pot of boiling water and let it simmer for about 2 hours, or until the pudding is firm and set.
10. Remove the pudding from the pot and let it cool slightly before untying the cloth.
11. Serve the quince pudding warm, either on its own or with a dollop of whipped cream or custard.

## Cooking time
Approximately 2 hours.
