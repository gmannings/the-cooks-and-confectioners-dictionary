# Apple Cider

## Description
This recipe is for making apple cider, a refreshing and popular beverage made from fermented apple juice. The apples are boiled, strained, and then mixed with more apples to ferment. The resulting cider is then pressed and stored.

## Ingredients:
- 1/2 bushel of apples (approximately 18 kg)
- 1 barrel of water (approximately 200 liters)

## Instructions:
1. Cut the half bushel of apples into slices.
2. In a large pot, boil the apple slices in the barrel of water until they become soft.
3. Let the water and apples mixture sit for twenty-four hours.
4. After twenty-four hours, strain out the clear liquid from the apple slices. Discard the apple slices.
5. In a vat with a tap at the bottom, place three bushels of bruised apples.
6. Pour the strained liquid from step 4 into the vat with the bruised apples.
7. For the next two to three days, draw off or strain the liquid from the vat three to four times a day.
8. After two to three days, place the apples in a hair-bag and press them to extract as much liquid as possible.
9. Mix the liquid extracted from the pressed apples with the liquid in the vat.
10. Allow the mixture to ferment until it has finished working. This may take several weeks.
11. Once fermentation is complete, transfer the cider into your desired vessels for storage.
12. Close the vessels tightly to prevent air from entering.

## Cooking time
- Boiling the apples: Approximately 1 hour
- Fermentation: Several weeks
