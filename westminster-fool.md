# Westminster Fool

## Description
Westminster Fool is a traditional English dessert made with layers of sliced bread soaked in sweetened cream and flavored with rosewater. It is a simple and refreshing dish that can be served cold.

## Ingredients:
- 4 slices of white bread
- 1/2 cup of sweet white wine (such as Sack or Sherry)
- 2 cups of heavy cream
- 4 eggs
- 1/4 teaspoon of ground mace
- 1/4 cup of sugar
- 1 tablespoon of rosewater

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F).
2. Slice the white bread into thin slices.
3. Arrange the bread slices in the bottom of a dish, forming a single layer.
4. Pour the sweet white wine over the bread slices, ensuring they are evenly moistened.
5. In a saucepan, heat the heavy cream over medium heat until it starts to simmer. Remove from heat.
6. In a mixing bowl, whisk together the eggs, ground mace, sugar, and rosewater until well combined.
7. Slowly pour the hot cream into the egg mixture, whisking constantly to prevent curdling.
8. Pour the cream mixture over the soaked bread slices in the dish, ensuring it is evenly distributed.
9. Place the dish in the preheated oven and bake for about 30 minutes, or until the custard is set and the top is lightly golden.
10. Remove from the oven and let it cool to room temperature.
11. Once cooled, refrigerate the dish for at least 2 hours, or until chilled.
12. Serve the Westminster Fool cold.
