# Pot Venison

## Description
Pot Venison is a traditional dish made with a haunch of venison that is marinated in a mixture of salt, nutmeg, pepper, and vinegar, then slow-cooked in clarified butter. The venison is cooked until tender and flavorful, and the resulting gravy is used to enhance the dish.

## Ingredients:
- 1 haunch of venison (approximately 2 kg)
- Salt
- 1 nutmeg
- 3 ounces (85 grams) of pepper
- White-wine vinegar
- 3 pounds (1.4 kg) of clarified butter

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 150°C (300°F).
2. Bone the haunch of venison and set it aside.
3. In a small bowl, mix together a sufficient quantity of salt, grated nutmeg, and pepper.
4. Add white-wine vinegar to the mixture and stir until well combined.
5. Wash the venison with the salt, nutmeg, pepper, and vinegar mixture, ensuring it is well coated.
6. Place the venison into a deep baking pan with the fat side facing downwards.
7. Pour the clarified butter over the venison, ensuring it is completely covered.
8. Cover the baking pan with a pastry crust, sealing it tightly.
9. Place the pan in the preheated oven and cook for approximately 5 to 6 hours, or until the venison is tender and cooked through.
10. Once cooked, remove the pan from the oven and press the venison down to the bottom of the pan.
11. Allow the venison to cool completely.
12. Once cooled, remove all the gravy from the top of the pan and transfer it to a saucepan.
13. Boil the gravy over medium heat until it has reduced by half.
14. Pour the reduced gravy back into the pan with the venison and clarified butter.
15. Serve the pot venison hot, with the gravy spooned over the top.
