# Wigs

## Description
Wigs are a type of sweet baked pastry that were popular in the 18th century. They are made with a dough that is flavored with coriander and sweetened with sugar. The dough is then shaped into small cakes and baked until golden brown.

## Ingredients:
- 500 grams of all-purpose flour
- 500 ml of ale yeast
- 225 grams of butter
- 225 grams of sugar
- 28 grams of coriander seeds, crushed and sifted
- 1 liter of milk

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F).
2. In a large mixing bowl, combine the flour, ale yeast, butter, sugar, crushed coriander seeds, and milk. Mix well until a smooth dough forms.
3. Take small portions of the dough and shape them into small cakes, about the size of a palm.
4. Place the shaped cakes on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper.
5. Brush the tops of the cakes with milk to give them a glossy finish.
6. Bake the wigs in the preheated oven for about 15 minutes, or until they are golden brown.
7. Remove the wigs from the oven and let them cool on a wire rack before serving.
