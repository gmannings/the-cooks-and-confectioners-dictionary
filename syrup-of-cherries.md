# Syrup of Cherries

## Description
Syrup of Cherries is a sweet and flavorful liquid made from clarified cherry juice and sugar. It can be used as a topping for desserts, added to beverages, or used as a base for cocktails.

## Ingredients:
- 1 quart of cherry juice (clarified)
- 1.5 pounds (680 grams) of sugar

## Instructions:
1. Clarify the cherry juice by passing it through a straining bag or cheesecloth to remove any solids or impurities.
2. In a saucepan, combine the clarified cherry juice and sugar.
3. Place the saucepan over medium heat and bring the mixture to a boil.
4. Continue boiling the mixture, stirring occasionally, until the sugar reaches a "pearl'd height" or until it thickens to a syrup-like consistency. This may take around 20-30 minutes.
5. Once the syrup has reached the desired consistency, remove it from the heat and let it cool.
6. Once the syrup is completely cooled, transfer it to a bottle for storage.

## Cooking time
Approximately 20-30 minutes.
