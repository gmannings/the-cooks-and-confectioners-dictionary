# Ragout of Veal Sweetbreads

## Description
This recipe is for a ragout made with veal sweetbreads. Sweetbreads are the thymus glands of young animals, and in this case, we are using veal sweetbreads. The sweetbreads are blanched, then cooked with melted bacon, herbs, and gravy. This ragout can be used as a garnish for various braised dishes.

## Ingredients:
- 500g veal sweetbreads
- 50g bacon, diced
- Salt and pepper to taste
- 1 faggot of fresh herbs (such as thyme, parsley, and bay leaves)
- 250ml good quality gravy

## Instructions:
1. Start by preparing the veal sweetbreads. Wash them thoroughly under cold water to remove any impurities.
2. Bring a pot of water to a boil and blanch the sweetbreads for about 5 minutes. This will help remove any remaining impurities and firm up the texture.
3. Remove the sweetbreads from the boiling water and immediately transfer them to a bowl of cold water. Let them sit in the cold water for a few minutes to cool down.
4. Once cooled, remove the sweetbreads from the water and pat them dry using a clean kitchen towel or paper towels.
5. In a saucepan, melt the diced bacon over medium heat. Cook until the bacon is crispy and has released its fat.
6. Add the dried sweetbreads to the saucepan with the bacon. Season with salt, pepper, and add the faggot of fresh herbs.
7. Toss the sweetbreads, bacon, and herbs together, ensuring they are well coated with the bacon fat and seasonings.
8. Pour the good quality gravy into the saucepan to moisten the sweetbreads. The gravy should be enough to cover the sweetbreads partially.
9. Reduce the heat to low and let the sweetbreads simmer gently in the gravy for about 20-30 minutes. This will allow the flavors to meld together and the sweetbreads to become tender.
10. Stir the sweetbreads occasionally to prevent them from sticking to the bottom of the saucepan.
11. Once the sweetbreads are cooked through and tender, remove them from the saucepan and set them aside.
12. The ragout is now ready to be used as a garnish for braised dishes. Serve the sweetbreads alongside the main dish or spoon them over the top.
