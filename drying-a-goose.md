# Drying a Goose

## Description
This recipe describes how to dry a goose before cooking it. Drying the goose helps to intensify its flavor and create a crispy skin.

## Ingredients:
- 1 goose
- Salt

## Instructions:
1. Start by ensuring that the goose is fat. If it is not already fat, you can feed it a high-fat diet for a month to help it gain some fat.
2. Sprinkle a generous amount of salt all over the goose, ensuring that it is evenly coated. This will help to preserve the meat and draw out moisture.
3. Hang the goose up in a cool, dry place, such as a well-ventilated pantry or a cool cellar. Make sure it is hung securely and that there is enough space around it for air circulation.
4. Leave the goose to dry for at least a month. During this time, the salt will draw out moisture from the meat, helping to dry it out and intensify the flavor.
5. After the drying period, the goose should feel firm and the skin should be dry to the touch.
6. Before cooking, boil the goose in a large pot of water for about 30 minutes. This will help to further tenderize the meat and remove any excess salt.
7. Once boiled, remove the goose from the pot and pat it dry with paper towels.
8. Serve the dried goose at the table, accompanied by mustard and sugar for dipping. You can also garnish the dish with bay leaves for added flavor and presentation.
