# Weftphalia Hams

## Description
Weftphalia Hams are a type of cured pork leg that originated in the Westphalia region of Germany. They are known for their rich flavor and tender texture. This recipe provides instructions for making your own Weftphalia Hams at home.

## Options and commentary
- It is recommended to use a leg of young fat pork for the best results.
- Black hogs are traditionally used for making Weftphalia Hams, but any high-quality pork will work.
- The curing process takes several weeks, so plan accordingly.

## Ingredients:
- 1 leg of young fat pork
- Salt
- Sugar
- Prague powder #1 (curing salt)
- Black pepper
- Juniper berries (optional)
- Bay leaves (optional)

## Instructions:
1. Hang the leg of pork in a cool, dry place for two days to allow it to dry slightly.
2. After two days, remove the leg of pork from the hanging position.
3. Using a meat mallet or rolling pin, beat the fleshy side of the leg of pork to tenderize it. Be sure to apply even pressure and cover the entire surface.
4. In a large container or food-grade plastic bag, combine salt, sugar, Prague powder #1, and black pepper. The ratio should be 2 parts salt, 1 part sugar, and 0.25% Prague powder #1 based on the weight of the pork leg. For example, if the pork leg weighs 2 kg, you would use 40 g salt, 20 g sugar, and 5 g Prague powder #1.
5. Optional: Crush a few juniper berries and add them to the curing mixture for additional flavor. You can also add a couple of bay leaves if desired.
6. Rub the curing mixture all over the leg of pork, ensuring that it is evenly coated. Massage the mixture into the meat to ensure good penetration.
7. Place the leg of pork in a large, sealable plastic bag or wrap it tightly in plastic wrap. Make sure to remove any excess air to create a vacuum-sealed environment.
8. Place the bagged leg of pork in the refrigerator and let it cure for 1 week per 2.5 cm of thickness. For example, if the thickest part of the leg of pork is 10 cm, you would cure it for approximately 4 weeks.
9. Every few days, flip the leg of pork over and massage the curing mixture into the meat to ensure even distribution.
10. After the curing period, remove the leg of pork from the bag and rinse it thoroughly under cold water to remove any excess salt and curing mixture.
11. Pat the leg of pork dry with paper towels and let it air dry for a few hours to develop a pellicle, which is a thin, tacky layer on the surface of the meat that helps with the smoking process.
12. Preheat your smoker to a temperature of 80-90째C (175-195째F).
13. Place the leg of pork in the smoker and smoke it for approximately 6-8 hours, or until the internal temperature reaches 65-70째C (150-160째F).
14. Remove the smoked leg of pork from the smoker and let it cool completely.
15. Once cooled, the Weftphalia Ham is ready to be sliced and enjoyed.
