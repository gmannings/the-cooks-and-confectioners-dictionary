# Larded Sole with Citrus Sauce

## Description
This recipe features sole fillets that are larded with salted salmon and then fried until half done. They are then stewed in a flavorful sauce made with white wine, wine vinegar, butter, orange slices, lemon slices, salt, and grated nutmeg. The dish is finished with slices of lemon, beaten butter, and orange juice.

## Options and commentary
- Instead of sole, you can use any white fish fillets such as cod or halibut.
- If you don't have larding needles, you can simply wrap the salmon around the fish fillets.
- The citrus sauce can be adjusted to taste by adding more or less lemon and orange juice.
- Serve the dish with steamed vegetables or a side of rice.

## Ingredients:
- 4 sole fillets
- 100g salted salmon, thinly sliced
- Flour, for dredging
- 100ml white wine
- 50ml wine vinegar
- 50g butter
- 1 orange, sliced
- 1 lemon, sliced
- Salt, to taste
- Grated nutmeg, to taste
- Slices of lemon, for garnish
- 50g butter, beaten
- Juice of 2 oranges

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 180Â°C.
2. Lay the sole fillets on a cutting board and lard them with the salted salmon slices. Cut the lard into equal lengths, leaving the sides shorter.
3. Dredge the larded sole fillets in flour, shaking off any excess.
4. Heat a large skillet over medium heat and add enough oil to coat the bottom.
5. Fry the sole fillets in the skillet until they are half done, about 2-3 minutes per side. Remove from the skillet and transfer to an oven-safe dish.
6. In a small bowl, mix together the white wine, wine vinegar, butter, orange slices, lemon slices, salt, and grated nutmeg.
7. Pour the mixture over the fried sole fillets in the oven-safe dish.
8. Cover the dish with another dish or aluminum foil to create a seal.
9. Place the dish in the preheated oven and let it stew for about 15-20 minutes, or until the fish is cooked through and the flavors have melded together.
10. Remove the dish from the oven and carefully transfer the sole fillets to a serving platter.
11. Garnish the sole fillets with slices of lemon.
12. In a small saucepan, melt the beaten butter over low heat. Once melted, remove from heat and stir in the juice of 2 oranges.
13. Drizzle the melted butter and orange juice mixture over the sole fillets.
14. Serve the larded sole with citrus sauce immediately.
