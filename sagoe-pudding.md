# Sagoe Pudding

## Description
Sagoe Pudding is a thick, creamy pudding made with sago pearls, milk, eggs, butter, and currants. It has a smooth texture and a hint of cinnamon and is sweetened to taste. This pudding is typically served as a dessert.

## Ingredients:
- 60g sago pearls
- 500ml whole milk
- 1 stick of cinnamon
- 115g unsalted butter
- 4 egg yolks
- 2 egg whites
- 2 tablespoons of Sack (a type of fortified wine, such as sherry)
- Sugar, to taste
- 30g currants
- Puff pastry sheet, for garnish

## Instructions:
1. Rinse the sago pearls under cold water to remove any impurities.
2. In a saucepan, bring 3-4 cups of water to a boil. Add the rinsed sago pearls and cook for 10 minutes, stirring occasionally.
3. Drain the cooked sago pearls and rinse them again under cold water to remove excess starch.
4. In the same saucepan, combine the cooked sago pearls, milk, and cinnamon stick. Bring to a boil over medium heat, stirring constantly to prevent sticking or burning.
5. Reduce the heat to low and continue to cook, stirring frequently, until the mixture thickens to the consistency of a hearty pudding. This should take about 20-30 minutes.
6. Remove the saucepan from the heat and discard the cinnamon stick.
7. Stir in the butter until melted and fully incorporated into the pudding.
8. In a separate bowl, whisk together the egg yolks, egg whites, and Sack.
9. Slowly pour the egg mixture into the saucepan with the pudding, stirring continuously to prevent the eggs from curdling.
10. Add sugar to taste, adjusting the sweetness according to your preference.
11. Stir in the plumped currants.
12. Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F).
13. Line the bottom of a baking dish with a sheet of puff pastry.
14. Pour the pudding mixture into the prepared baking dish.
15. Use additional puff pastry to garnish the brim of the dish, creating a decorative edge.
16. Bake the pudding in the preheated oven for 25-30 minutes, or until the top is golden brown and the pudding is set.
17. Remove from the oven and let it cool slightly before serving.
