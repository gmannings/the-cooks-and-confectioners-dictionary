# Lobster Soup

## Description
This recipe is for a rich and flavorful lobster soup. It calls for a variety of fish to make the stock, and includes a forcemeat loaf in the center of the soup. The lobster meat is cut into dice and added to the soup, which is then garnished with a pastry rim and lemon slices.

## Options and commentary
- Instead of using a variety of fish, you can use fish stock or seafood stock as a base for the soup.
- The forcemeat loaf can be made with a combination of ground pork and breadcrumbs, seasoned with herbs and spices.
- You can use lobster tails or whole lobsters for this recipe.
- The pastry rim can be made with puff pastry or pie dough.

## Ingredients:
- 4-5 pounds of fish (such as carp, tench, pike, trout, flounders, or whitings)

- Lobster spawn (roe)
- Cullis (a rich sauce or gravy)

## Instructions:
1. Prepare the fish stock by following the directions for making crayfish soup stock.

3. Pound the lobster spawn and strain it with the cullis, as directed in the crayfish soup recipe.
4. Remove the meat from the lobsters and cut it into square pieces, resembling large dice.
5. In a saucepan, heat a little of the cullis and add the diced lobster meat. Season with salt and pepper, and warm it through. Add a piece of butter to the forcemeat loaf in the middle of the soup.
6. Soak the bread and heat the cullis. Squeeze in some lemon juice.
7. Dish up the soup and garnish with a rim of pastry dough. Place slices of lemon on the outside of the rim.
