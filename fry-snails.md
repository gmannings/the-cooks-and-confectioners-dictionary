# Fry Snails

## Description
This recipe is for frying snails, a dish commonly enjoyed in the 18th century. The snails are first boiled to tenderize them, then cleaned and coated in flour before being fried. They are then served with a flavorful sauce made with butter, vinegar, fried onions, parsley, and either beaten butter and orange juice or oil, vinegar, and slices of lemon.

## Ingredients:
- Shell snails (approximately 500g)
- Flour
- Butter
- Vinegar
- Onions
- Parsley
- Juice of 1 orange or oil
- Slices of lemon

## Instructions:
1. In a large pot, bring water to a boil.
2. Add the shell snails to the boiling water and cook until tender. This will take approximately 20-30 minutes.
3. Once cooked, remove the snails from the shells and clean them to remove any slime.
4. Coat the cleaned snails in flour, ensuring they are evenly coated.
5. In a frying pan, melt a generous amount of butter over medium heat.
6. Add the floured snails to the pan and fry them until they are golden brown and crispy. This will take approximately 5-7 minutes.
7. While the snails are frying, prepare the sauce. In a separate saucepan, melt some butter and add vinegar, fried onions, and chopped parsley. Cook until the onions are soft and translucent.
8. For the first sauce option, add beaten butter and the juice of one orange to the saucepan. Stir well to combine.
9. For the second sauce option, add oil, vinegar, and slices of lemon to the saucepan. Stir well to combine.
10. Once the snails are fried, remove them from the pan and place them on a serving dish.
11. Pour the prepared sauce over the fried snails, ensuring they are well coated.
12. Serve the fried snails with the sauce immediately.
