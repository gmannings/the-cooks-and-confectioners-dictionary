# Beef Steaks to Fry

## Description
This recipe is for frying beef steaks in a flavorful ale marinade and serving them with a savory butter and herb topping. It is a classic dish that is perfect for a hearty and delicious meal.

## Options and commentary
- You can use any cut of beef steak that you prefer, such as ribeye, sirloin, or tenderloin.
- If you don't have ale, you can substitute it with beef broth or red wine for a rich flavor.
- Feel free to adjust the amount of onion, shallot, and herbs according to your taste preferences.
- The grated nutmeg adds a warm and aromatic flavor, but you can omit it if you don't have it on hand.

## Ingredients:
- Beef steaks (any cut)
- 1/2 pint (250 ml) ale
- 1 onion, finely chopped
- Salt
- 1 shallot, finely chopped
- Fresh thyme leaves, chopped
- Fresh parsley, chopped
- Fresh savory, chopped
- Grated nutmeg
- Butter
- Flour

## Instructions:
1. Place the beef steaks on a cutting board and use a meat tenderizer or a rolling pin to beat them gently. This will help to tenderize the meat and ensure even cooking.
2. In a shallow dish, combine the ale and half of the chopped onion. Season with salt and mix well.
3. Place the beef steaks in the ale marinade, making sure they are fully submerged. Let them marinate for at least 30 minutes, or up to overnight in the refrigerator for maximum flavor.
4. In a small bowl, combine the remaining chopped onion, shallot, thyme, parsley, savory, and grated nutmeg. Mix well to combine the flavors.
5. Remove the beef steaks from the marinade and pat them dry with paper towels. Discard the marinade.
6. Heat a frying pan over medium-high heat and add a knob of butter. Once the butter has melted and is sizzling, add the beef steaks to the pan.
7. Cook the steaks for a few minutes on each side, depending on the thickness and desired level of doneness. For medium-rare, cook for about 3-4 minutes per side.
8. While the steaks are cooking, prepare the savory butter topping. Take a piece of butter and roll it in flour to create a small ball. Repeat this process to make several butter balls.
9. Sprinkle the butter balls over the cooked steaks in the pan. Allow them to melt and coat the steaks with a rich and flavorful butter sauce.
10. Transfer the beef steaks to a serving platter and garnish with the chopped herb mixture.
11. Serve the beef steaks hot with the savory butter topping.
