# Boiled Flounders with Plaice

## Description
This recipe is for boiling flounders and plaice in a flavorful broth. The fish is cooked until it is tender and then served with a tangy sauce made from the cooking liquid, butter, anchovies, and capers. The dish is garnished with parsley, capers, orange, and lemon.

## Ingredients:
- 2 flounders
- 2 plaice
- Salt
- Whole spices (such as peppercorns, cloves, and bay leaves)
- 250 ml white wine
- A bunch of fresh herbs (such as parsley, thyme, and dill)
- 50 ml vinegar
- 50 g butter
- 2-3 anchovies
- 1 tablespoon capers
- Parsley, for garnish
- Capers, for garnish
- Orange slices, for garnish
- Lemon slices, for garnish

## Instructions:
1. Fill a large pot with water and add salt, whole spices, white wine, and the bunch of fresh herbs. Bring the water to a boil.
2. Once the water is boiling, add the vinegar to the pot. The vinegar will help make the fish crispy.
3. Allow the water to come back to a boil before adding the fish.
4. Carefully place the flounders and plaice into the boiling water. Let them boil until they float, which indicates that they are cooked through. This should take about 5-7 minutes.
5. Using a slotted spoon, carefully remove the cooked fish from the pot and drain them well.
6. In a small saucepan, take a little of the cooking liquid and add butter, anchovies, and capers. Place the saucepan over medium heat and stir until the butter has melted and the sauce has thickened.
7. Arrange the boiled fish on a serving dish. Pour the sauce over the fish.
8. Garnish the dish with parsley, capers, orange slices, and lemon slices.
