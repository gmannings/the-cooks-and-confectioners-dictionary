# Roasted Hare

## Description
This recipe is for roasting a hare, a traditional dish from the 18th century. The hare is larded (pierced with strips of fat) to keep it moist during cooking. It is then roasted on a spit and basted with cream. The hare is served with a sweet sauce or a poivrade sauce, which is a rich, savory sauce made with red wine, vinegar, and spices.

## Ingredients:
- 1 hare
- Lard (fat strips for larding)
- Cream
- Sweet sauce or poivrade sauce (for serving)

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F).
2. Lard one side of the hare by making small incisions in the meat and inserting strips of fat. Leave the other side unlarded.
3. Place the larded hare on a spit and secure it properly.
4. Place the spit with the hare in the preheated oven.
5. Roast the hare for about 1 hour, or until the meat is cooked through and tender. Baste the hare with cream every 15 minutes to keep it moist.
6. While the hare is roasting, prepare the sweet sauce or poivrade sauce according to your preference.
7. Once the hare is cooked, remove it from the oven and let it rest for a few minutes.
8. Carve the hare into serving portions and arrange them on a platter.
9. Serve the roasted hare with the sweet sauce or poivrade sauce on the side.

## Cooking time
Approximately 1 hour.
