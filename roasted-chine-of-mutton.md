# Roasted Chine of Mutton

## Description
This recipe is for a roasted chine of mutton, which is a cut of meat from the backbone of the animal. The chine is seasoned with bacon, herbs, and spices, then roasted to perfection. It is served with a ragout and garnished with mutton cutlets.

## Options and commentary
- Instead of a chine of mutton, you can use a bone-in pork loin or a bone-in lamb loin.
- Feel free to adjust the seasonings to your taste preferences.
- The ragout can be made with vegetables, mushrooms, or any other desired ingredients.
- Cooking time may vary depending on the size and thickness of the meat.

## Ingredients:
- 1 chine of mutton (or bone-in pork loin or lamb loin)
- Slices of lean gammon of bacon
- White pepper
- Chives
- Parsley
- Bacon slices (for barding)
- Tape or kitchen twine
- Crumb bread (breadcrumbs)
- Ragout ingredients of your choice
- Mutton cutlets (for garnish)

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F).
2. Raise the skin from the chine bone downwards, leaving it hanging to the lower part.
3. Season the chine with white pepper, chopped chives, and parsley.
4. Lay slices of lean gammon of bacon over the seasoned chine.
5. Place bacon slices on top of the bacon slices.
6. Fold the skin back over the bacon slices.
7. Tie up the chine with kitchen twine or tape to secure the filling.
8. Place a sheet of parchment paper over the chine to prevent it from drying out during roasting.
9. Roast the chine in the preheated oven for approximately 20 minutes per 500g (1lb) of meat, or until the internal temperature reaches your desired level of doneness.
10. While the chine is roasting, prepare the ragout by sautéing your chosen ingredients in a pan until cooked and tender.
11. Once the chine is cooked to your liking, remove it from the oven and let it rest for a few minutes.
12. Sprinkle the chine with crumb bread and place it back in the oven for a few minutes to create a crispy crust.
13. Remove the chine from the oven and let it rest again.
14. Slice the chine into individual portions and serve it on a platter, garnished with mutton cutlets.
15. Serve the ragout on the side or underneath the sliced chine.
