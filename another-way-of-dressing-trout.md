# Another Way of Dressing Trout

## Description
This recipe provides an alternative method for preparing trout. The trout is first gutted, scraped, and larded with strips of bacon. It is then cooked in a stewpan with bacon and seasoned with gravy, champagne wine, and onions. Finally, the trout is served with a ragout made with mushrooms, truffles, and other garnishes.

## Options and commentary
- Instead of larding the trout with bacon, you can wrap the trout in bacon slices.
- You can use white wine or fish stock instead of champagne wine.
- The garnishes can be adjusted based on personal preference and availability.

## Ingredients:
- 2-3 trout
- Strips of bacon
- Bards of bacon
- Gravy
- Champagne wine (or white wine)
- 1 onion
- Cloves
- Mushrooms
- Truffles
- Garnishes of choice (e.g., artichoke bottoms, small trout collops)

## Instructions:
1. Gut the trout at the gills and scrape off any scales. Rinse the trout and pat them dry.
2. Place the trout on a dressing board.
3. Heat a fire shovel until it is red hot.
4. Pass the hot fire shovel lightly over the trout several times to harden the skin.
5. Lard the trout by inserting strips of bacon into rows along the fish.
6. Garnish the bottom of a stewpan with bards of bacon.
7. Place the larded trout on top of the bacon bards.
8. Cover the stewpan.
9. Cook the trout over a fire, both over and under the stewpan.
10. Stir the trout occasionally to prevent them from sticking to the stewpan.
11. Once the trout are well colored, remove the bacon bards.
12. In a separate saucepan, combine the trout with good gravy, a little champagne wine, and an onion stuck with cloves.
13. Stew the trout gently in the saucepan.
14. Season the trout with salt and pepper to taste.
15. When a significant amount of the liquid has stewed away and the trout is nearly cooked, add mushrooms, truffles, and any other desired garnishes to a gammon essence to make a ragout.
16. Dish the trout onto serving plates.
17. Remove any excess fat from the saucepan.
18. Pour the ragout sauce over the trout.
19. Garnish the dish with artichoke bottoms or small trout collops that have been well larded.
20. Serve the trout immediately.
