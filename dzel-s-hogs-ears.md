# Dzel's Hogs Ears

## Description
Dzel's Hogs Ears is a dish made from pork ears that are first boiled, then baked, and finally fried. The ears are served with a tangy sauce made from the pickle liquid, butter, flour, and mustard.

## Ingredients:
- 4 pork ears
- Water
- Salt
- Pepper
- 1 large onion
- 1 bay leaf
- 2 tablespoons butter
- 2 tablespoons flour
- 1 tablespoon mustard

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F).
2. Rinse the pork ears under cold water to remove any dirt or debris.
3. Place the pork ears in a pot and add enough water to cover them.
4. Season the water with salt, pepper, the large onion (peeled and quartered), and the bay leaf.
5. Bring the water to a boil over high heat, then reduce the heat to low and simmer for 1 hour or until the pork ears are tender.
6. Remove the pork ears from the pot and place them in a baking dish.
7. Bake the pork ears in the preheated oven for 30 minutes or until they are browned and crispy.
8. While the pork ears are baking, prepare the sauce. In a small saucepan, melt the butter over medium heat.
9. Add the flour to the melted butter and stir until it forms a smooth paste.
10. Gradually pour in 3-4 tablespoons of the pickle liquid from the pot, stirring constantly to prevent lumps from forming.
11. Stir in the mustard until well combined.
12. Continue cooking the sauce over low heat for 5 minutes or until it thickens.
13. Once the pork ears are done baking, remove them from the oven and let them cool slightly.
14. Cut the pork ears into thin slices.
15. Heat a frying pan over medium heat and add a small amount of oil or butter.
16. Fry the sliced pork ears in the pan until they are crispy and golden brown.
17. Transfer the fried pork ears to a serving dish.
18. Pour the prepared sauce over the fried pork ears.
19. Serve the Dzel's Hogs Ears hot as an appetizer or main dish.
