# Pickled Mushrooms

## Description
This recipe is for pickling mushrooms in a flavorful vinegar and wine mixture. The mushrooms are first boiled in a mixture of milk and water with onions, thyme, and savory. Then they are drained and added to a pickling liquid made with white wine vinegar, white wine, and various spices. The pickling liquid is boiled until reduced, then cooled and combined with the liquid the mushrooms were boiled in. The pickled mushrooms can be stored and enjoyed as a tangy and savory condiment.
