# Mermaid Pye

## Description
Mermaid Pye is a traditional 18th century dish made with pork, tongues, and bacon. The pork is seasoned with salt, pepper, nutmeg, and sage, then layered with slices of boiled tongues and bacon. The pie is baked until golden and served cold.

## Ingredients:
- 1 whole pig, boneless
- Salt
- Pepper
- Nutmeg
- Fresh sage leaves
- 2 boiled neats tongues, cold and dried
- Slices of bacon
- Butter

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F).
2. Scald the pig by pouring boiling water over it to remove any hair or impurities. Pat dry with a cloth.
3. Season the pork loin with salt, pepper, nutmeg, and shredded sage. Ensure the seasoning is evenly distributed.
4. Cut the boiled neats tongues into long slices, approximately the thickness of a half-crown coin.
5. In a pie dish, layer one quarter of the seasoned pork loin. Place slices of tongue on top of the pork.
6. Repeat the layering process with the remaining quarters of pork and tongue slices.
7. Cover the layers with slices of bacon.
8. Dot the top of the pie with small pieces of butter.
9. Place the pie dish in the preheated oven and bake for approximately 2 hours, or until the pork is cooked through and the bacon is crispy.
10. Once baked, remove the pie from the oven and let it cool.
11. Fill any gaps in the pie with fresh butter.
12. Allow the pie to cool completely before serving. It is traditionally eaten cold.

Approximately 2 hours.
