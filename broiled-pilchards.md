# Broiled Pilchards

## Description
Broiled pilchards are a simple and flavorful dish made with fresh pilchards (a type of small fish) that are seasoned, grilled, and served with a tangy sauce. This dish is quick and easy to prepare, making it a great option for a weeknight dinner.

## Ingredients:
- 4 fresh pilchards
- Salt
- Butter
- For the sauce:
  - 2 pilchard heads
  - 1/4 cup beer
  - Salt

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the grill to medium heat.
2. Clean the pilchards by removing the guts and scales. Rinse them under cold water and pat them dry with paper towels.
3. Season the pilchards with salt on both sides.
4. Place the pilchards on the grill and cook them over a gentle fire for about 4-5 minutes per side, or until they are cooked through and have a nice char.
5. While the pilchards are grilling, melt a tablespoon of butter in a small saucepan over low heat.
6. In a separate saucepan, place the pilchard heads between two trenchers (cutting boards) and squeeze them to extract the juices. Add the beer and a pinch of salt to the saucepan with the pilchard heads.
7. Cook the sauce over medium heat for about 5 minutes, stirring occasionally, until it thickens slightly.
8. Remove the pilchards from the grill and baste them with melted butter.
9. Serve the broiled pilchards with the sauce on the side or drizzled over the top.

## Cooking time
Approximately 10-15 minutes.
