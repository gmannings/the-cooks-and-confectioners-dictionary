# Robart Sauce

## Description
Robart Sauce is a savory sauce made with onions, bacon, gravy, veal, ham, vinegar, and mustard. It has a rich and tangy flavor that pairs well with meats and vegetables.

## Ingredients:
- 2 onions
- 2 slices of bacon
- 1 cup gravy
- Salt and pepper to taste
- 1/4 cup cullis of veal and ham (a thick sauce made from veal and ham stock)
- 1 tablespoon vinegar
- 1 tablespoon mustard

## Instructions:
1. Cut the onions into small dice-shaped pieces.
2. Heat a saucepan over medium heat and add the bacon. Cook until the bacon is crispy and the fat has rendered.
3. Add the diced onions to the saucepan with the melted bacon. Stir constantly to prevent burning.
4. Cook the onions until they are half browned.
5. Remove as much fat as possible from the saucepan.
6. Add the gravy to the saucepan to moisten the onions. Season with salt and pepper.
7. Reduce the heat to low and let the onions simmer gently.
8. After the onions have simmered for a while, add the cullis of veal and ham to bind the sauce.
9. Stir in the vinegar and mustard.
10. Continue simmering the sauce for a few more minutes to allow the flavors to meld together.
11. Taste and adjust the seasoning if needed.
