# Boiled Shad

## Description
Boiled Shad is a classic dish that features a tender and flavorful fish cooked in a flavorful broth. The fish is boiled in a mixture of white wine vinegar, salt, pepper, onion, butter, lemon, and bay leaf, which infuses it with a delicious taste. This dish can be served as a first course and is best enjoyed when served dry on a napkin.

## Ingredients:
- 1 Shad (approximately 1 kg)
- 500 ml white wine vinegar
- 1 tablespoon salt
- 1 teaspoon black pepper
- 1 onion
- 4 cloves
- 50 grams butter
- 1 lemon, sliced
- 1 bay leaf

## Instructions:
1. Start by preparing the Shad. Clean and scale the fish, removing any innards. Cut the Shad into serving-sized pieces.

2. In a large pot, combine the white wine vinegar, salt, black pepper, onion (stuck with cloves), butter, lemon slices, and bay leaf. Add enough water to the pot to fully submerge the fish.

3. Place the pot on the stove over medium heat and bring the liquid to a boil.

4. Once the liquid is boiling, carefully add the Shad pieces to the pot. Reduce the heat to low and let the fish simmer gently for about 10-15 minutes, or until the fish is cooked through and flakes easily with a fork.

5. Once the Shad is cooked, carefully remove the fish from the pot using a slotted spoon and transfer it to a serving platter lined with a napkin or paper towels to absorb any excess moisture.

6. Serve the Boiled Shad as a first course, either warm or at room temperature. Discard the cooking liquid or strain it and serve it as a broth alongside the fish if desired.

## Cooking time
Approximately 10-15 minutes
