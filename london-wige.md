# London Wige

## Description
London Wige is a traditional 18th century pastry made with flour, sugar, caraway seeds, butter, milk or cream, ale yeast, and a touch of Canary wine. The pastry is shaped into wigs and baked until golden brown.

## Ingredients:
- 500g flour
- 250g sugar
- Caraway seeds, to taste
- 300g butter
- 750ml milk or cream
- 250ml ale yeast
- A splash of Canary wine (optional)

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F).
2. In a large mixing bowl, combine the flour, sugar, and caraway seeds. Mix well.
3. Place the bowl near the fire to dry the mixture slightly.
4. In a saucepan, melt the butter over low heat. Stir frequently to prevent burning.
5. Once the butter has melted, add the milk or cream to the saucepan. Warm the mixture gently, stirring occasionally.
6. Remove the saucepan from the heat and add the ale yeast and Canary wine (if using). Mix well.
7. Pour the liquid mixture into the flour mixture. Stir until a dough forms.
8. Place the dough in a warm spot, such as near the fire, and allow it to rise until doubled in size. This may take about 1-2 hours.
9. Once the dough has risen, shape it into wigs. You can shape them into small individual wigs or one large wig.
10. Place the wigs on greased or lined baking sheets.
11. Bake in the preheated oven for about 20-25 minutes, or until the wigs are golden brown.
12. Remove from the oven and allow the wigs to cool before serving.

## Cooking time
Approximately 1-2 hours (including rising time) + 20-25 minutes baking time.
