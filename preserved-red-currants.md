# Preserved Red Currants

## Description
This recipe is for preserving red currants in a sweet syrup. The currants are cooked in pearled sugar to create a thick, flavorful liquid that can be used in various dishes or enjoyed on its own.

## Ingredients:
- 500g red currants
- 500g pearled sugar (also known as pearl sugar)

## Instructions:
1. Pick the red currants, removing any stems or leaves.
2. Place the currants in a saucepan and add enough pearled sugar to lightly cover them.
3. Bring the mixture to a gentle boil, skimming off any foam that rises to the surface.
4. Remove the saucepan from heat and let it cool overnight.
5. The next day, strain the currants through a sieve to separate them from the syrup.
6. Return the syrup to the saucepan and continue boiling until it reaches a consistency between pearl-like and smooth.
7. Add the strained currants back into the syrup.
8. Add enough additional pearled sugar to fully coat the currants and create a thick syrup.
9. Bring the mixture to a boil, then reduce the heat to a simmer.
10. Allow the currants to simmer in the syrup, covered, for several boilings, alternating between smooth and pearl-like consistency.
11. Skim off any foam that forms on the surface during the simmering process.
12. Stir the currants occasionally until they are slightly cooled, to prevent them from turning into jelly.
