# Marmalade of Lemons

## Description
This recipe is for making a delicious marmalade using lemons. The lemons are boiled to soften the rinds, then pounded with apples (pippins) in a mortar. The mixture is then combined with sugar syrup and lemon juice, boiled until it reaches a jelly-like consistency, and finally stored in pots or glasses for future use.

## Ingredients:
- Rinds of 4 lemons
- 4 apples (pippins)
- Sugar (equal weight to lemon rinds and apples)
- Water (1 pint for every pound of sugar)
- Juice of 4 lemons

## Instructions:
1. In a large pot, bring several waters to a boil. Add the lemon rinds and boil until they are very tender. This may take a few rounds of boiling in fresh water.
2. Once the lemon rinds are tender, remove them from the pot and transfer them to a mortar.
3. Add the apples (pippins) to the mortar with the lemon rinds and pound them together until they form a smooth paste.
4. In a separate pot, combine the sugar and water. Heat the mixture over medium heat, stirring until the sugar is completely dissolved.
5. Increase the heat to high and bring the sugar syrup to a boil. Continue boiling until the syrup reaches a thick consistency, similar to a syrup.
6. Add the lemon and apple paste to the sugar syrup. Stir well to combine.
7. Reduce the heat to medium and continue boiling the mixture, stirring occasionally, until it becomes clear.
8. Squeeze in the juice of the 4 lemons and stir well.
9. Continue boiling the mixture until it reaches a jelly-like consistency. This may take some time, so be patient.
10. Once the marmalade has reached the desired consistency, remove it from the heat.
11. Carefully transfer the hot marmalade into clean pots or glasses, ensuring they are properly sealed.
12. Allow the marmalade to cool completely before storing it in a cool, dark place.
