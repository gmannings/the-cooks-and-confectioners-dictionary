# Broiled Dullet with Butter Sauce

## Description
This recipe is for broiled dullets, a type of fish. The fish is scaled, gutted, and filleted before being dipped in melted butter and broiled. The dish is served with a flavorful butter sauce made with clarified butter, fried flour, salt, pepper, nutmeg, sweet herbs, lemon slices, capers, and either orange juice or verjuice.

## Ingredients:
- 2 whole dullets (or any small fish of your choice)
- 50g butter, melted
- 50g clarified butter
- 1 tablespoon flour
- Salt, to taste
- Pepper, to taste
- Nutmeg, a pinch
- A small bunch of fresh sweet herbs (such as parsley, thyme, and dill)
- 1 lemon, sliced
- 1 tablespoon capers
- Juice of 1 orange or 2 tablespoons verjuice

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the broiler in your oven.
2. Scale the dullets by scraping off the scales using a knife or a fish scaler.
3. Gut the dullets by making a small incision along the belly and removing the innards.
4. Fillet the dullets by cutting along the backbone from head to tail on both sides, then carefully removing the fillets.
5. Gash the sides of the fillets by making shallow diagonal cuts on the skin side.
6. Dip the fillets in the melted butter, ensuring they are well coated.
7. Place the fillets on a broiler pan or a baking sheet lined with aluminum foil.
8. Broil the fillets for about 4-5 minutes on each side, or until they are cooked through and nicely browned.
9. While the fish is broiling, prepare the sauce. In a small saucepan, melt the clarified butter over medium heat.
10. Add the flour to the melted butter and cook, stirring constantly, until the flour is lightly browned.
11. Season the flour mixture with salt, pepper, and nutmeg.
12. Add the sweet herbs, lemon slices, capers, and the juice of the orange or verjuice to the saucepan.
13. Cook the sauce for a few minutes, stirring occasionally, until it thickens slightly and the flavors meld together.
14. Remove the broiled dullets from the oven and transfer them to a serving platter.
15. Pour the butter sauce over the broiled dullets.
16. Serve the broiled dullets with the butter sauce immediately.
