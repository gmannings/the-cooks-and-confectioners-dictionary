# Fried Beets

## Description
This recipe is for frying beets in a thin batter and serving them with a lemon juice. The beets are first baked, then sliced and soaked in a batter made with white wine, flour, cream, and eggs. They are then coated with flour, breadcrumbs, and parsley before being fried until crispy. The dish can also be made into a fricassee with butter, parsley, salt, pepper, and onions.

## Ingredients:
- 4 beets
- 100 ml white wine
- 100 g flour
- 100 ml cream
- 2 eggs
- Salt, to taste
- Pepper, to taste
- 1/2 tsp beaten cloves
- Flour, for dredging
- Breadcrumbs, for coating
- Fresh parsley, finely chopped
- Butter, for fricassee
- 1 onion, finely chopped

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 180Â°C.
2. Place the beets on a baking sheet and bake them in the oven until they are tender, about 1 hour.
3. Remove the beets from the oven and let them cool slightly. Peel the beets and cut them into slices, about half an inch thick.
4. In a bowl, whisk together the white wine, flour, cream, eggs (more yolks than whites), salt, pepper, and beaten cloves to make a thin batter. Let the batter sit for a few minutes.
5. Place the beet slices in the batter and let them soak for a little while.
6. In a separate bowl, mix together flour, breadcrumbs, and chopped parsley.
7. Remove the beet slices from the batter and dredge them in the flour, breadcrumb, and parsley mixture, ensuring they are well coated.
8. Heat oil in a frying pan over medium heat. Fry the beet slices until they are crispy and golden brown on both sides. Remove them from the pan and drain on paper towels.
9. For the fricassee option, melt butter in a separate pan over medium heat. Add the finely chopped onion and cook until it becomes translucent. Add the beet slices and cook for a few more minutes, stirring occasionally. Season with salt, pepper, and additional parsley if desired.
10. Serve the fried beets or fricassee in plates with a squeeze of lemon juice.
