# Sack Custard (Without Milk)

## Description
This recipe is a variation of a custard made without milk. It uses eggs and sack (a type of fortified wine) as the base, resulting in a rich and flavorful dessert. The custard is sweetened with sugar and flavored with nutmeg.

## Options and commentary
- Sack: Sack is a type of fortified wine that was popular in the 18th century. If you can't find sack, you can substitute it with a sweet white wine or a fortified wine like sherry or Madeira.
- Ale: The recipe calls for adding ale to the egg mixture. This adds a unique flavor to the custard. If you prefer, you can omit the ale or substitute it with a different type of alcohol, such as brandy or rum.

## Ingredients:
- 12 eggs
- 1 pint of sack (or substitute with sweet white wine or fortified wine)
- 1/2 pound of sugar
- A pinch of nutmeg
- Ale (optional, substitute with brandy or rum if desired)

## Instructions:
1. In a mixing bowl, separate the yolks and whites of the eggs. Remove any threads or membranes from the yolks.
2. In a saucepan, bring the sack and sugar to a boil. Stir well to dissolve the sugar and create a syrup-like consistency. Add a pinch of nutmeg to the mixture.
3. Remove the saucepan from the heat and gradually pour the hot sack mixture into the beaten eggs, stirring constantly. If using, add a splash of ale to the mixture and continue stirring.
4. Place the saucepan back on the heat and cook the mixture over low heat, stirring continuously, until it thickens to a custard consistency. This should take about 10-15 minutes.
5. Once the custard has thickened, remove it from the heat and transfer it to a serving dish.
6. Allow the custard to cool slightly before serving. It can be served warm or chilled, depending on your preference.
