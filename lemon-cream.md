# Lemon Cream

## Description
Lemon Cream is a creamy and refreshing dessert made with boiled cream, lemon, white wine, and sugar. It has a smooth and tangy flavor with a hint of citrus. This recipe can be made in advance and stored in the refrigerator for a few days.

## Options and commentary
- You can add a small amount of grated lemon zest for extra lemon flavor.
- If you don't have white wine, you can substitute it with lemon juice or a non-alcoholic white grape juice.
- Ambergrease is a rare and expensive ingredient, so it can be omitted if not available.

## Ingredients:
- 1 liter of cream
- 1 lemon
- 250 ml of white wine
- Sugar to taste
- Optional: a small amount of grated lemon zest
- Optional: a grain of ambergrease

## Instructions:
1. In a large saucepan, bring the cream to a boil over medium heat. Stir occasionally to prevent scorching.
2. Once the cream reaches a boil, remove it from the heat and let it cool completely.
3. While the cream is cooling, use a vegetable peeler to carefully remove the thin outer layer of the lemon peel. Avoid the white pith as it can be bitter.
4. In a separate container, steep the lemon peel in white wine for two hours.
5. After two hours, remove the lemon peel from the wine and discard it.
6. Squeeze the juice from the lemon and set it aside.
7. Once the cream is cold, add the lemon juice, white wine, and sugar to taste. Whisk the mixture vigorously in one direction until it thickens to a desired consistency.
8. If using, add a small amount of grated lemon zest and a grain of ambergrease to enhance the flavor.
9. Fill individual serving glasses with the lemon cream mixture.
10. Cover the glasses and refrigerate overnight before serving.
11. Lemon Cream can be stored in the refrigerator for up to three or four days.
