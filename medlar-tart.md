# Medlar Tart

## Description
A Medlar Tart is a sweet dessert made with cooked and strained medlars, flavored with sugar, eggs, cinnamon, and ginger. The mixture is then baked in a tart shell and topped with a sprinkle of sugar.

## Ingredients:
- 500g ripe medlars
- 100g sugar
- 2 egg yolks
- 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon
- 1/2 teaspoon ginger
- 1 pre-made tart shell
- Additional sugar for sprinkling

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F).
2. Cut the medlars in half and remove the seeds.
3. Place the medlars in a saucepan and cook over low heat until they become soft and mushy, about 10 minutes.
4. Pass the cooked medlars through a fine mesh sieve to remove any skins or fibers. Discard the solids.
5. Return the strained medlar puree to the saucepan.
6. Add the sugar, egg yolks, cinnamon, and ginger to the saucepan with the medlar puree.
7. Cook the mixture over medium heat, stirring constantly, until it thickens slightly, about 5 minutes.
8. Remove the saucepan from the heat and let the mixture cool slightly.
9. Pour the medlar mixture into the pre-made tart shell.
10. Place the tart on a baking sheet and bake in the preheated oven for 20-25 minutes, or until the tart crust is golden brown and the filling is set.
11. Remove the tart from the oven and let it cool completely.
12. Once cooled, sprinkle some additional sugar over the top of the tart.
13. Serve the Medlar Tart at room temperature.
