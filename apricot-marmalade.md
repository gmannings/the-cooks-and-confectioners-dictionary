# Apricot Marmalade

## Description
This recipe is for making a delicious apricot marmalade. The apricots are boiled with sugar until they release their scum, then cooled and boiled again until they reach a thick consistency. The marmalade is then sweetened further with sugar and simmered to incorporate the flavors. It can be stored in pots for later use.

## Options and commentary
- You can adjust the amount of sugar used according to your taste preference.
- If you prefer a smoother texture, you can blend the marmalade after it has cooled.

## Ingredients:
- 2.3 kg ripe apricots
- 900 g pearled sugar
- 1.4 kg sugar

## Instructions:
1. Wash the apricots and remove the pits. Cut them into halves or quarters, depending on their size.
2. In a large pot, combine the apricots and pearled sugar. Bring to a boil over medium heat, stirring occasionally.
3. Skim off any scum that rises to the surface. Continue boiling until the apricots have softened and released their scum, about 15-20 minutes.
4. Remove the pot from the heat and let the mixture cool.
5. Once cooled, return the pot to the heat and continue cooking over low heat. Use a potato masher or fork to break down the apricots until they reach a thick, jam-like consistency. This may take about 1-2 hours.
6. In a separate pot, bring the remaining sugar to a "crack" stage. This means heating the sugar until it reaches a temperature of around 150°C (300°F) or until a small amount dropped into cold water forms brittle threads.
7. Carefully pour the hot sugar into the apricot mixture, stirring continuously to incorporate it evenly.
8. Simmer the mixture for an additional 10-15 minutes to allow the flavors to meld together.
9. Remove the pot from the heat and let the marmalade cool slightly.
10. If desired, use an immersion blender or food processor to blend the marmalade until smooth.
11. Transfer the marmalade into clean, sterilized pots. Sprinkle the tops with a thin layer of fine sugar to help preserve the marmalade.
12. Seal the pots tightly and store in a cool, dark place.

## Cooking time
Approximately 2-3 hours (including cooling and blending time)
