# Fried Conger

## Description
Fried Conger is a dish made from a type of fish called Conger eel. The eel is scalded to remove the skin, fins are removed, and then it is split. It is then coated in flour and fried until crispy in clarified butter. The dish is served with a sauce made from beaten butter, vinegar, and lemon juice. It is garnished with fried parsley or clary, which is fried in butter.

## Ingredients:
- 1 Conger eel
- Flour
- Clarified butter
