# Farced Cabbage

## Description
Farced cabbage is a dish where cabbage leaves are stuffed with a mixture of bacon, veal, boiled cabbage, eggs, salt, pepper, grated bread, and cheese. The stuffed cabbage is then cooked in a flavorful broth and garnished with grated cheese. It is a hearty and flavorful dish that can be served as a main course.

## Ingredients:
- 1 large cabbage
- 200g fat bacon
- 200g veal
- 100g boiled cabbage
- 2-3 egg yolks
- Salt, to taste
- Pepper, to taste
- 50g grated bread
- 50g grated cheese
- 1 liter strong broth

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 180Â°C.
2. Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Add the cabbage leaves and blanch them for 2-3 minutes to soften them. Drain and set aside.
3. In a food processor, combine the fat bacon, veal, boiled cabbage, egg yolks, salt, pepper, grated bread, and grated cheese. Process until well combined and the mixture forms a paste-like consistency.
4. Take a cabbage leaf and place a spoonful of the stuffing mixture in the center. Fold the sides of the leaf over the stuffing and roll it up tightly. Repeat with the remaining cabbage leaves and stuffing mixture.
5. Place the stuffed cabbage rolls in a large ovenproof dish. Pour the strong broth over the cabbage rolls, ensuring they are partially submerged.
6. Cover the dish with foil and bake in the preheated oven for 45-60 minutes, or until the cabbage rolls are cooked through and tender.
7. Remove the foil and sprinkle the grated cheese over the top of the cabbage rolls. Return to the oven for an additional 5-10 minutes, or until the cheese is melted and golden.
8. Serve the farced cabbage rolls hot as the first course, garnished with additional grated cheese.
