# Venison Pie

## Description
This recipe is for a traditional venison pie, which was a popular dish in the 18th century. The venison is marinated and then larded with bacon before being encased in a brown rye pastry. The pie is then baked until the meat is tender and the pastry is golden and crisp.

## Options and commentary
- You can use any cut of venison for this recipe, such as loin or shoulder.
- If you don't have access to venison, you can substitute it with beef or lamb.
- The marinade adds flavor to the meat and helps to tenderize it. You can customize the marinade by adding herbs and spices of your choice.
- Larding the venison with bacon helps to keep it moist during the long cooking process.
- Rye flour is used to make the pastry because it helps to preserve the meat and is more portable. However, you can use all-purpose flour if you prefer.
- Pounding lard or using thin slices of bacon to line the pastry adds extra flavor and helps to keep the meat moist.
- The baking time may vary depending on the size and thickness of the venison. It is important to make a hole in the middle of the pie to prevent it from bursting during baking.

## Ingredients:
- 1.5 kg venison (or beef/lamb)
- 200 g bacon, cut into large lardons
- Salt and pepper, to taste
- 1/2 teaspoon ground cloves
- 1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg
- 500 g rye flour (or all-purpose flour)
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 50 g butter
- Pounded lard or thin slices of bacon, for lining the pastry
- Bay leaves, for garnish
- Whites of eggs, for egg wash

## Instructions:
1. In a large bowl, prepare the marinade by combining salt, pepper, ground cloves, and ground nutmeg. Mix well.
2. Place the venison in the marinade and ensure it is well coated. Cover the bowl and refrigerate for at least 4 hours or overnight.
3. Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F).
4. In a separate bowl, prepare the pastry by combining rye flour (or all-purpose flour) and salt. Mix well.
5. Add the butter to the flour mixture and rub it in with your fingertips until the mixture resembles breadcrumbs.
6. Gradually add cold water, a little at a time, until the mixture comes together to form a dough. Knead the dough lightly until smooth.
7. Roll out two-thirds of the pastry on a lightly floured surface to fit the base and sides of a pie dish.
8. Line the pastry with pounded lard or thin slices of bacon.
9. Remove the venison from the marinade and pat it dry with paper towels.
10. Place the larded venison in the pie dish and cover it with bay leaves.
11. Roll out the remaining pastry to make a lid for the pie. Place it over the venison and seal the edges by crimping or pressing with a fork.
12. Make a hole in the middle of the pie to allow steam to escape during baking.
13. Brush the top of the pie with the whites of eggs to give it a golden color.
14. Place the pie dish on a baking sheet and transfer it to the preheated oven.
15. Bake the pie for 3-4 hours, or until the venison is tender and the pastry is golden and crisp.
16. Remove the pie from the oven and carefully seal the hole in the middle with a small piece of pastry.
17. Allow the pie to cool slightly before serving.
