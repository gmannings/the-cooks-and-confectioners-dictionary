# Farce Weal Sweet-beads a la Dauphine

## Description
This recipe is for a classic French dish called "Farce Weal Sweet-beads a la Dauphine." It involves preparing sweetbreads (thymus or pancreas glands of a young calf) by scalding them and then larding them with boiled gammon (ham). The sweetbreads are then stuffed with a delicious farce (a forcemeat mixture) and baked. They are served with a ragout of mushrooms, truffles, artichoke bottoms, and cockscombs, all stuffed with the same farce. The dish is rich and flavorful, with a combination of meaty and earthy flavors.

## Options and commentary
- Sweetbreads: If you can't find sweetbreads, you can substitute with chicken or veal. However, keep in mind that the texture and flavor will be different.
- Larding: Larding involves inserting strips of fat (in this case, boiled gammon) into the meat to add moisture and flavor. If you don't have larding needles, you can skip this step and proceed with the recipe.
- Farce: The farce can be made with a combination of ground pork, veal, and chicken, along with breadcrumbs, eggs, herbs, and spices. You can also add some finely chopped mushrooms or truffles to enhance the flavor.
- Ragout: The ragout can be made with a combination of mushrooms, truffles, artichoke bottoms, and cockscombs. If you can't find cockscombs, you can omit them or substitute with chicken or veal meatballs.
- Cullis: Cullis is a type of thickened sauce. You can make a simple chicken or veal stock-based sauce to serve with the dish.

## Ingredients:
- 2 sweetbreads
- 100g boiled gammon (ham)
- 200g ground pork
- 200g ground veal
- 200g ground chicken
- 100g breadcrumbs
- 2 eggs
- Salt and pepper to taste
- 200g mushrooms, sliced
- 50g truffles, finely chopped
- 4 artichoke bottoms, cooked and quartered
- 4 cockscombs (optional)
- Chicken or veal stock for sauce

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 180°C.
2. Bring a pot of water to a boil and blanch the sweetbreads for 5 minutes. Remove from the water and let them cool slightly.
3. Using a larding needle or a sharp knife, insert strips of boiled gammon into the sweetbreads, creating small incisions.
4. In a bowl, combine the ground pork, veal, and chicken with breadcrumbs, eggs, salt, and pepper. Mix well to form a smooth farce.
5. Cut a hole in the sweetbreads, but not all the way through. Stuff the sweetbreads with the farce mixture, ensuring they are well filled.
6. Place the stuffed sweetbreads in a baking pan and bake in the preheated oven for 30-40 minutes, or until cooked through and golden brown.
7. While the sweetbreads are baking, prepare the ragout. In a separate pan, sauté the mushrooms until they release their moisture and start to brown. Add the truffles, artichoke bottoms, and cockscombs (if using). Cook for another 5 minutes until the flavors meld together.
8. In a small saucepan, heat the chicken or veal stock and reduce it slightly to create a flavorful sauce.
9. Once the sweetbreads are cooked, remove them from the oven and let them rest for a few minutes.
10. Serve the stuffed sweetbreads on a platter, surrounded by the ragout. Drizzle the reduced stock sauce over the dish.
11. Enjoy this decadent and flavorful French dish!
