# Jemelloes

## Description
Jemelloes are a sweet confectionery treat made from a mixture of sugar, caraway seeds, eggs, musk, and gum-dragon. The mixture is formed into a soft paste, piped into small knots, and then boiled in a syrup made from rosewater and sugar.

## Ingredients:
- 450g double-refined sugar
- 2 grams caraway seeds, finely ground
- 4 egg yolks
- A pinch of musk (optional)
- A small quantity of gum-dragon, dissolved in rosewater
- Rosewater, for boiling
- Additional sugar, for boiling

## Instructions:
1. In a mixing bowl, combine the double-refined sugar, finely ground caraway seeds, egg yolks, musk (if using), and the dissolved gum-dragon in rosewater. Mix well until all the ingredients are fully incorporated.
2. The mixture should have a soft consistency, similar to butter. If it is too dry, add a little more rosewater. If it is too wet, add a little more sugar.
3. Transfer the mixture to a butter-squirt or a piping bag fitted with a small round tip.
4. Prepare a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Pipe the mixture onto the parchment paper in small knots, about the size of a marble. Leave some space between each knot as they will expand slightly during cooking.
5. Allow the knots to sit on the parchment paper for a short while to harden slightly.
6. In a large pot, bring a mixture of rosewater and sugar to a boil. The amount of rosewater and sugar will depend on the size of your pot and the desired amount of syrup. Aim for a syrup that will cover the knots when they are added.
7. Carefully drop the knots into the boiling syrup. Cook them for a few minutes until they become firm and glossy.
8. Remove the knots from the syrup using a slotted spoon and place them on a wire rack to cool and dry.
9. Once the knots are completely dry, they are ready to be enjoyed.
