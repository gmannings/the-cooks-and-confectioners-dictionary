# Fried Pike

## Description
This recipe is for frying a pike, a type of freshwater fish. The pike is coated in flour and fried until crispy. It is then served with a sauce made from butter, oyster liquor, white wine, and nutmeg. The dish is garnished with fried parsley, slices of orange, and lemon.

## Ingredients:
- 1 pike, cleaned
- Flour, for coating
- Fresh butter, for frying
- 50 ml oyster liquor
- 50 ml white wine
- 1/4 teaspoon nutmeg
- Fresh parsley, for garnish
- Slices of orange and lemon, for garnish

## Instructions:
1. Clean the pike by removing any slime and blood. Rinse it well under cold water.
2. Pat the pike dry with paper towels.
3. Coat the pike in flour, ensuring it is evenly coated on all sides.
4. Heat a generous amount of fresh butter in a frying pan over medium heat.
5. Once the butter is melted and hot, carefully place the coated pike in the pan.
6. Fry the pike until it is crispy and golden brown on both sides. This will take approximately 5-7 minutes per side, depending on the thickness of the fish.
7. While the pike is frying, prepare the sauce. In a separate saucepan, melt a knob of butter over low heat.
8. Add the oyster liquor, white wine, and nutmeg to the melted butter. Stir well to combine.
9. Increase the heat to medium and cook the sauce until it thickens slightly, stirring occasionally. This will take approximately 5 minutes.
10. Once the pike is cooked, remove it from the frying pan and place it on a serving platter.
11. Pour the prepared sauce over the fried pike.
12. Garnish the dish with fried parsley, slices of orange, and lemon.
