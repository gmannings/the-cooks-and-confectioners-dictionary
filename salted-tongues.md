# Salted Tongues

## Description
Salted tongues are a preserved meat dish made from curing and drying beef tongues. They were commonly prepared in the 18th century as a way to preserve meat for longer periods of time.

## Options and commentary
- This recipe calls for beef tongues, but you can also use pork or lamb tongues if desired.
- The curing process takes several days, so plan ahead.
- The drying step can be done in a traditional oven or using a food dehydrator.

## Ingredients:
- 2-3 beef tongues
- Brine solution (enough to cover the tongues)
- Refined salt

## Instructions:
1. In a large container, prepare a brine solution by dissolving salt in enough water to fully submerge the beef tongues. Use approximately 1 cup (240 ml) of salt for every 4 cups (1 liter) of water.
2. Place the beef tongues in the brine solution and let them soak for 2-3 days in the refrigerator.
3. After the brining period, remove the beef tongues from the brine and rinse them thoroughly under cold water to remove any excess salt.
4. Sprinkle a layer of refined salt over the tongues and let them sit for an additional 2-3 days in a cool, dry place. This will help further cure the meat.
5. Hang the beef tongues near the air of a chimney or in a well-ventilated area for a few hours to allow them to dry slightly.
6. Preheat your oven to a low temperature, around 150°C (300°F).
7. Place the beef tongues on a baking sheet or a wire rack and put them in the oven. Keep the oven door slightly ajar to allow moisture to escape.
8. Dry the beef tongues in the oven for several hours, or until they are firm and dry to the touch. This can take anywhere from 6 to 12 hours, depending on the size of the tongues.
9. Once the beef tongues are fully dried, remove them from the oven and let them cool completely.
10. Store the salted tongues in an airtight container or wrap them tightly in plastic wrap. They can be kept at room temperature for several weeks or refrigerated for longer storage.
