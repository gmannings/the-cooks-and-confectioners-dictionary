# Ragoo of Eel Points

## Description
Ragoo of Eel Points is a dish made with fried eel points cooked in a flavorful sauce made with burnt butter, flour, dissolved anchovies, and seasonings. It is a rich and savory dish that can be served as a main course or as a side dish.

## Ingredients:
- 500g eel points
- 50g flour
- 50g butter
- 2 anchovy fillets, dissolved in a little water
- Salt, to taste
- Chives, chopped
- Nutmeg, grated
- 50ml verjuice (or substitute with white wine vinegar)
- Fresh parsley, for garnish

## Instructions:
1. Clean the eel points by rinsing them well under hot water to remove any slime. Pat them dry with paper towels.
2. Coat the eel points with flour, shaking off any excess.
3. Heat the butter in a frying pan over medium heat. Fry the eel points until golden brown and cooked through. Remove from the pan and set aside.
4. In the same pan, add the burnt butter. To make burnt butter, heat the butter until it turns brown and develops a nutty aroma. Be careful not to burn it.
5. Add the flour to the burnt butter and cook for a minute, stirring constantly.
6. Stir in the dissolved anchovies and mix well.
7. Season the sauce with salt, chopped chives, grated nutmeg, and verjuice. Adjust the seasoning according to your taste.
8. Return the fried eel points to the pan and coat them with the sauce. Reduce the heat to low and simmer for about 10-15 minutes, or until the eel points are tender and the flavors have melded together.
9. Meanwhile, heat a small amount of oil in another pan and fry the parsley until crispy. Remove from the pan and set aside.
10. Once the eel points are cooked, garnish the dish with the fried parsley.
11. Serve the Ragoo of Eel Points hot as a main course or as a side dish.
