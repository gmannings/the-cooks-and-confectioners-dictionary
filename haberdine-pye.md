# Haberdine Pye

## Description
Haberdine Pye is a traditional 18th-century dish made with minced fish, apples, spices, and dried fruits. The mixture is baked in a pie crust and then topped with a sweet icing made with sugar and rosewater.

## Ingredients:
- 500g white fish fillets (such as cod or haddock)
- 2 apples, peeled, cored, and finely chopped
- 1/2 teaspoon ground pepper
- 1/2 teaspoon ground ginger
- 1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg
- 1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon
- 1 tablespoon rosewater
- 2 tablespoons sugar
- 50g raisins
- 50g currants
- 50g pitted and sliced dates
- Zest of 1 lemon
- 50g butter
- 1 tablespoon verjuice (or substitute with lemon juice)
- 1 pie crust (store-bought or homemade)
- Additional sugar and rosewater for icing

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F).
2. Oil the fish fillets and remove the skin. Boil the fish until cooked through, then drain and let it cool.
3. Once cooled, mince the fish flesh using a knife or food processor.
4. In a mixing bowl, combine the minced fish, chopped apples, ground pepper, ground ginger, ground nutmeg, ground cinnamon, rosewater, sugar, raisins, currants, sliced dates, and lemon zest. Mix well to combine.
5. In a separate bowl, beat the butter with verjuice (or lemon juice) until creamy.
6. Add the butter mixture to the fish and fruit mixture. Stir until everything is well combined.
7. Roll out the pie crust and line a pie dish with it.
8. Pour the fish and fruit mixture into the pie crust.
9. Cover the pie with another layer of pie crust or use strips of dough to create a lattice pattern on top.
10. Bake the pie in the preheated oven for about 40-45 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown and the filling is cooked through.
11. While the pie is baking, prepare the icing by mixing sugar and rosewater until it forms a thick paste.
12. Once the pie is baked, remove it from the oven and let it cool slightly.
13. Spread the icing over the top of the pie.
14. Allow the pie to cool completely before serving.
