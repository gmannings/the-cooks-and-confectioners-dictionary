# Boiled Mullets with Claret Sauce

## Description
This recipe is for boiled mullets, a type of fish. The fish is boiled and then served with a flavorful claret sauce, which is made with red wine, vinegar, herbs, spices, and anchovies. The dish is garnished with stewed oysters for added flavor and presentation.

## Options and commentary
- You can use any type of white fish instead of mullets, such as cod or haddock.
- If you don't have claret, you can use any dry red wine.
- If you don't have winter savory, marjoram, or thyme, you can use any combination of fresh or dried herbs like rosemary, sage, or parsley.
- If you don't have nutmeg or mace, you can omit them or use a pinch of ground cloves instead.
- Stewed oysters can be optional if you prefer to serve the dish without them.

## Ingredients:
- 2 mullets (or any white fish fillets)
- 1 pint (473 ml) claret (or any dry red wine)
- Salt, to taste
- Vinegar, to taste
- 2 onions, sliced
- 1 bunch of winter savory (or any fresh or dried herbs)
- 1 bunch of marjoram (or any fresh or dried herbs)
- 1 bunch of thyme (or any fresh or dried herbs)
- 1/2 teaspoon grated nutmeg (or a pinch of ground cloves)
- 1/2 teaspoon broken mace (optional)
- Juice of 1 lemon
- 2-3 anchovies
- Stewed oysters, for garnish (optional)

## Instructions:
1. Remove the roes and livers from the mullets and set them aside.
2. Fill a large pot with water and bring it to a boil.
3. Add the mullets to the boiling water and cook them until they are tender and fully cooked. This usually takes about 10-15 minutes, depending on the thickness of the fish fillets.
4. Once the fish is cooked, carefully remove it from the pot and set it aside.
5. Pour out most of the water from the pot, leaving only a small amount.
6. Add the claret, salt, vinegar, sliced onions, winter savory, marjoram, thyme, grated nutmeg, broken mace (if using), and the juice of a lemon to the pot with the remaining water.
7. Bring the mixture to a boil and let it simmer for a few minutes to allow the flavors to meld together.
8. Add the cooked fish back into the pot and let it simmer in the sauce until it absorbs the flavors and tastes strong.
9. In the meantime, finely chop the reserved roes and livers.
10. Add the chopped roes and livers to the pot along with the anchovies.
11. Stir everything together and let it simmer for a few more minutes until the sauce thickens slightly.
12. Remove the pot from the heat and transfer the fish and sauce to a serving dish.
13. Garnish the dish with stewed oysters, if desired.
14. Serve the boiled mullets with claret sauce hot.
