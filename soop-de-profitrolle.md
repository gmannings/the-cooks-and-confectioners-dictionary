# Soop de Profitrolle

## Description
Soop de Profitrolle is a rich and flavorful soup made with a combination of roasted game birds, veal sweetbreads, and a savory broth. The dish is traditionally served with a French roll filled with a hash made from the roasted game bird meat. The soup is garnished with lemon and served hot.

## Options and commentary
- Instead of partridges and pheasants, you can use chicken or turkey as a more accessible alternative.
- If veal sweetbreads are not available, you can substitute them with chicken or pork sweetbreads.
- The French roll can be replaced with a bread bowl or served with crusty bread on the side.
- You can add additional vegetables like onions, carrots, and celery to enhance the flavor of the broth.
- Adjust the seasoning according to your taste preferences.
