# Braised Salmon with Veal and Wine

## Description
This recipe is a modernized version of an 18th-century dish that combines the flavors of salmon, veal, and wine. The salmon is larded with bacon and then braised with veal slices in a flavorful broth. It is served with a choice of either a crayfish ragout or a ragout made with veal sweetbreads and cockscombs.

## Options and commentary
- Instead of larding the salmon with bacon, you can wrap it in thin slices of bacon.
- For the veal slices, you can use veal cutlets or veal stew meat.
- The choice of ragout is up to personal preference. The crayfish ragout adds a seafood element, while the veal sweetbreads and cockscombs ragout adds a rich and meaty flavor.

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F).
2. Lard the salmon by inserting the bacon slices into the flesh of the salmon.
3. Tie the salmon securely with kitchen twine to hold its shape.
4. In a large stew-pan, arrange the slices of fat bacon at the bottom.
5. Place the veal slices on top of the bacon.
6. Cook over a gentle heat until the meat starts to brown and stick to the pan.
7. Sprinkle the flour over the meat and stir well to coat.
8. Cook for another 6-8 minutes, stirring constantly, until the flour is cooked and lightly browned.
9. Gradually add the broth and a few spoonfuls of gravy, stirring continuously to create a smooth sauce.
10. Transfer the salmon to a long stew-pan.
11. Pour the sauce from the veal over the salmon.
12. Arrange the slices of veal on top of the salmon.
13. Pour in the white or champagne wine, ensuring there is enough liquid to stew the salmon.
14. Add the butter, salt, pepper, spices, sliced onion, lemon, and fresh herbs to the stew-pan.
15. Place the stew-pan over a gentle heat and bring the liquid to a simmer.
16. Cover the stew-pan and let the salmon stew for approximately 30-40 minutes, or until cooked through.
17. Remove the stew-pan from the heat and let the salmon rest in the liquid for about 2 hours to enhance the flavors.
18. Carefully remove the salmon from the stew-pan and drain any excess liquid.
19. Untie the kitchen twine and transfer the salmon to a serving dish.
