# Calves Foot Pudding

## Description
Calves Foot Pudding is a traditional 18th-century dish made with minced calves feet, bread, cream, beef suet, eggs, currants, salt, sugar, and nutmeg. It is then wrapped in a caul of veal and boiled. The pudding is served on sippets (toasted bread) with butter, sugar, and either verjuice or sack (a type of fortified wine). It is often garnished with orange and citron peel, as well as blanched almonds.

## Options and commentary
- Instead of calves feet, you can use gelatin or agar-agar to achieve a similar texture.
- If you prefer a vegetarian version, you can substitute the calves feet with a mixture of mushrooms and tofu.
- The pudding can be served with a variety of sauces or toppings, such as custard, caramel, or fruit compote.
- The garnishes can be adjusted to personal preference or omitted altogether.

## Ingredients:
- 2 calves feet (or alternative)

7. Take a caul of a breast of veal and fold it like a sheet of paper, leaving one end open.
8. Fill the caul with the pudding mixture, adding a good quantity of marrow if desired.
9. Sew up the caul in a cloth to form a pudding shape.
