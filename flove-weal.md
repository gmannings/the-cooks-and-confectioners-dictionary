# Flove Weal

## Description
Flove Weal is a dish made from a filet of veal that is seasoned with salt, pepper, nutmeg, and herbs, and then stuffed with seasoned udder slices. The veal is then stewed with onions, lemon, and broth until tender. Mushrooms, oysters, and capers are added towards the end of cooking to enhance the flavor. The dish is thickened with flour and served hot.

## Ingredients:
- 1 filet of veal
- 1 udder (optional, can be omitted for a vegetarian version)
- Salt
- Pepper
- Nutmeg
- Fresh herbs (such as parsley, thyme, and rosemary)
- 1 onion
- Cloves
- 1 lemon
- 1 pint (473 ml) strong broth (beef or vegetable)
- 1 pint (473 ml) mushrooms
- 1 pint (473 ml) oysters
- 2 spoonfuls of capers
- Flour (for thickening)

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F).
2. Cut away an inch of the middle bone from the filet of veal on each side.
3. If using udder, cut off the udder and slice it into long slices.
4. In a small bowl, mix together salt, pepper, nutmeg, and finely shredded fresh herbs.
5. Make holes in the filet of veal and insert the seasoned udder slices into the holes as thick as possible.
6. Place the filet of veal in a large stew-pan.
7. Set the stew-pan over low heat and gently turn and shake the filet of veal occasionally.
8. After some time, when the filet of veal is nearly cooked, skim off any fat that has accumulated on the surface.
9. Stick cloves into the onion and add it to the stew-pan.
10. Cut the lemon in half, squeeze the juice into the stew-pan, and add the lemon halves as well.
11. Continue cooking the filet of veal for approximately 5 hours over low heat. If the fire is weak, it may take longer.
12. About 1 hour before the filet of veal is fully cooked, add the strong broth to the stew-pan.
13. When the filet of veal is tender and fully cooked, add the mushrooms, oysters, and capers to the stew-pan along with a little bit of the broth.
14. Skim off any fat that has risen to the surface again.
15. Before using the cooking liquid, thicken it with flour. Gradually sprinkle flour into the stew-pan while stirring continuously until the desired thickness is achieved.
16. Transfer the filet of veal and the thickened cooking liquid to a serving dish.
17. Serve the Flove Weal hot.
