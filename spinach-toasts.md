# Spinach Toasts

## Description
Spinach Toasts are a delicious and nutritious dish made with blanched spinach, eggs, apples, and breadcrumbs. The mixture is spread on slices of bread and baked until golden and crispy. These toasts can be served as a light supper or as a side dish in a second course.

## Ingredients:
- 500g spinach
- 3-4 apples, boiled and mashed
- 4 hard-boiled egg yolks
- 3 raw eggs

- Salt and sugar to taste
- A handful of currants, picked and washed
- 3-4 tablespoons melted butter

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 180Â°C.

5. Add the currants and melted butter to the spinach mixture and mix well.
6. Cut the slices of bread into half-inch thick slices, approximately 4 inches long and 2 inches wide.
7. Spread the spinach mixture evenly on one side of each bread slice, making it about half an inch thick.
8. Brush the top of the spinach mixture with the beaten egg white.
9. Butter the bottom of a baking dish or a patty pan.
