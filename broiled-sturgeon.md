# Broiled Sturgeon

## Description
Broiled Sturgeon is a flavorful and tender dish that can be enjoyed as a main course. The sturgeon can be broiled either as a whole fish or cut into thick slices. The fish is marinated in a mixture of sweet oil and wine vinegar, then broiled on a gentle fire. It is basted with the marinade and infused with the aromatic flavors of rosemary, thyme, and parsley. The broiled sturgeon is served with the dripping from the basting and garnished with branches of rosemary. Alternatively, it can be basted with butter and served with a sauce made from butter, vinegar, lemon slices, or orange juice.

## Options and commentary
- You can choose to broil a whole sturgeon or cut it into thick slices.
- The marinade can be made with sweet oil and wine vinegar, or you can use a combination of butter, vinegar, lemon slices, or orange juice for a different flavor profile.
- The garnish can be branches of rosemary or any other fresh herbs of your choice.

## Ingredients:
- 1 whole sturgeon or sturgeon slices (about 1 inch thick)
- Sweet oil (or butter)
- Wine vinegar (or vinegar)
- Sprigs of rosemary
- Sprigs of thyme
- Fresh parsley
- Salt
- Butter (optional)
- Lemon slices or juice of orange (optional)

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the broiler in your oven.
2. If using a whole sturgeon, clean and scale the fish. If using sturgeon slices, ensure they are about 1 inch thick.
3. Season the sturgeon with salt on both sides.
4. In a bowl, mix together sweet oil (or melted butter) and wine vinegar (or vinegar) to make the marinade.
5. Place the sturgeon in a shallow dish and pour the marinade over it. Ensure the fish is well coated. Add sprigs of rosemary, thyme, and parsley to the marinade.
6. Let the sturgeon marinate for at least 30 minutes, or up to 2 hours in the refrigerator.
7. Remove the sturgeon from the marinade and place it on a broiler pan or a baking sheet lined with aluminum foil.
8. Set the broiler pan or baking sheet with the sturgeon under the preheated broiler.
9. Broil the sturgeon on a gentle fire for about 5-7 minutes per side, or until it is cooked through and nicely browned. Baste the sturgeon with the marinade every few minutes during cooking.
10. While the sturgeon is broiling, prepare the optional butter basting sauce. In a small saucepan, melt butter and add vinegar. If using lemon slices, add them to the saucepan. Heat the sauce gently until the butter is melted and the flavors are combined.
11. Once the sturgeon is cooked, remove it from the broiler and transfer it to a serving platter.
12. If using the optional butter basting sauce, pour it over the broiled sturgeon. Alternatively, you can serve the sturgeon with the dripping from the marinade.
13. Garnish the broiled sturgeon with fresh sprigs of rosemary or any other herbs of your choice.
14. Serve the broiled sturgeon hot with your choice of side dishes.
