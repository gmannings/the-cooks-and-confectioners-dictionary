# Dzels Eggs with Bread

## Description
Dzels Eggs with Bread is a dish made by soaking bread in milk, straining it, and then adding various flavorings such as salt, sugar, orange flower water, grated orange peel, and candied lemon peel. The mixture is then poured into a buttered silver dish and cooked until the eggs are well colored.

## Ingredients:
- 4 slices of bread
- 1 cup milk
- Pinch of salt
- 1 tablespoon sugar
- 1 teaspoon orange flower water
- 1 teaspoon grated orange peel
- 1 teaspoon candied lemon peel
- Butter, for greasing the dish
- 4 eggs

## Instructions:
1. In a bowl, soak the bread slices in milk for 2-3 hours.
2. After soaking, strain the bread through a sieve or fine colander to remove any excess milk.
3. Add a pinch of salt, sugar, orange flower water, grated orange peel, and candied lemon peel to the bread mixture. Mix well to combine all the ingredients.
4. Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F).
5. Grease the inside of a silver dish with butter. Heat the dish slightly before greasing to make it easier to spread the butter.
6. Pour the bread mixture into the buttered silver dish.
7. Place the dish in the preheated oven and cook for about 15-20 minutes, or until the eggs are well colored.
8. Remove from the oven and let it cool slightly before serving.

## Cooking time
Approximately 15-20 minutes.
