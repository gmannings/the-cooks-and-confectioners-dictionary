# Capon Larded with Lemons

## Description
This recipe is for a roasted capon (a castrated rooster) that is larded with bacon and preserved lemons. The capon is first scalded to remove any impurities and then coated with oatmeal to give it a white appearance. It is then simmered in a flavorful broth made with mutton broth, herbs, dates, currants, spices, almonds, sugar, verjuice (sour juice from unripe fruit), and butter. After boiling, the capon is placed in a deep dish and the broth is poured over it. The dish is garnished with preserved barberries and sippets (small pieces of toasted bread).

## Options and commentary
- Instead of a capon, you can use a chicken or any other poultry of your choice.
- If you don't have mutton broth, you can use chicken or vegetable broth as a substitute.
- Preserved lemons can be found in specialty stores or you can make your own by preserving lemons in salt and lemon juice.
- Verjuice can be substituted with lemon juice or white wine vinegar.
- Barberries can be substituted with cranberries or any other tart berry.

## Ingredients:
- 1 capon (or chicken)
- Dust of oatmeal
- 1 pint of mutton broth (or chicken or vegetable broth)
- 1 bunch of sweet herbs (such as parsley, thyme, and rosemary)
- 2-3 dates, cut long ways
- A handful of currants, parboiled
- 1/4 teaspoon whole pepper
- 1 blade of mace
- 1/4 teaspoon grated nutmeg
- 50g almonds, ground or finely chopped
- 1 tablespoon sugar
- 2 tablespoons verjuice (or lemon juice or white wine vinegar)
- 1 tablespoon butter
- Thick lardons of bacon
- Preserved lemons, thinly sliced
- Preserved barberries (or cranberries)
- Sippets (small pieces of toasted bread)

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F).
2. Scald the capon by placing it in a pot of boiling water for a few minutes. This will help remove any impurities from the skin.
3. Remove the capon from the water and pat it dry with paper towels.
4. Coat the capon with a dusting of oatmeal to give it a white appearance.
5. In a large pot, combine the mutton broth, sweet herbs, dates, currants, whole pepper, mace, and grated nutmeg. Bring to a simmer over medium heat.
6. In a separate bowl, mix the ground almonds, sugar, verjuice, and butter to make a thick paste.
7. Take the capon and lard it by inserting thick lardons of bacon and slices of preserved lemon into the flesh.
8. Place the larded capon in the simmering broth and cook for about 1 hour, or until the capon is cooked through and tender.
9. Remove the capon from the pot and place it in a deep dish.
10. Strain the broth and pour it over the capon in the dish.
11. Garnish the dish with preserved barberries and sippets.
12. Serve the capon hot, with the broth spooned over the top.
