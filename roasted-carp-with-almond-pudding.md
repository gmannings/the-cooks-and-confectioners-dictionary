# Roasted Carp with Almond Pudding

## Description
This recipe is for roasting a whole carp in the oven. The carp is stuffed with a delicious almond pudding mixture and served with a flavorful sauce made from white wine or claret, carp gravy, anchovies, and breadcrumbs.

## Options and commentary
- You can use any type of whole fish instead of carp, such as trout or snapper.
- If you prefer a different type of stuffing, you can replace the almond pudding with a mixture of breadcrumbs, herbs, and spices.
- The sauce can be customized by adding additional ingredients like herbs, garlic, or lemon juice.

## Ingredients:
- 1 whole carp (approximately 1-1.5 kg)
- For the almond pudding:
  - 100g almond paste
  - 50g grated white bread
  - 1/2 teaspoon salt
  - 50ml cream
  - 1/4 teaspoon grated nutmeg
  - 2 raw egg yolks
  - 1 tablespoon candied lemon peel, finely chopped
  - 1 teaspoon caraway seeds
- For the sauce:
  - 200ml white wine or claret
  - Carp gravy (drippings from the roasted carp)
  - 2 anchovies, dissolved in a little water
  - 2 tablespoons grated white bread
  - 50g butter
  - 2 egg yolks

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 180Â°C.
2. Clean the carp by removing the scales, gutting it, and rinsing it thoroughly.
3. Remove the gall, milt, or spawn from the carp.
4. In a bowl, mix together the almond paste, grated white bread, salt, cream, grated nutmeg, raw egg yolks, candied lemon peel, and caraway seeds to make the almond pudding.
5. Stuff the carp's belly with the almond pudding mixture, pushing it through the gills.
6. Place a few small sticks or a wire rack in a roasting pan to elevate the carp.
7. Lay the stuffed carp on the sticks or rack in the roasting pan.
8. Roast the carp in the preheated oven for approximately 30-40 minutes or until cooked through. The cooking time may vary depending on the size of the fish.
9. While the carp is roasting, prepare the sauce. In a saucepan, combine the white wine or claret, carp gravy, dissolved anchovies, and grated white bread.
10. Cook the sauce over medium heat until the breadcrumbs have dissolved and the sauce has thickened slightly.
11. Remove the saucepan from the heat and add the butter and egg yolks. Stir until the butter has melted and the sauce is smooth and creamy.
12. Once the carp is cooked, remove it from the oven and transfer it to a serving dish.
13. Pour the sauce over the roasted carp.
14. Serve the roasted carp with almond pudding and sauce immediately.

## Cooking time
Approximately 30-40 minutes, depending on the size of the fish.
