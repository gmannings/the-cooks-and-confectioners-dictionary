# Lemonade Jelly

## Description
This recipe is for making a refreshing and tangy lemonade jelly. It is a sweet and citrusy dessert that can be enjoyed on its own or used as a topping for other desserts.

## Options and commentary
- You can adjust the amount of sugar and lemon juice according to your taste preferences.
- You can also add some lemon zest for extra flavor.
- If you prefer a clearer jelly, you can strain it multiple times or use a jelly bag.

## Ingredients:
- 1 pound (450g) hartshorn (hartshorn is a type of powdered deer antler, but it is not commonly used in modern cooking. You can substitute it with gelatin or agar-agar)
- 4 quarts (3.8 liters) spring water
- 1 1/2 pounds (680g) double refined sugar
- Juice of 7-8 large lemons

## Instructions:
1. In a large pot, combine the hartshorn (or gelatin/agar-agar) and spring water.
2. Bring the mixture to a boil over medium heat, then reduce the heat to low.
3. Cover the pot with a lid and let it simmer for 5-6 hours. Stir occasionally to prevent sticking.
4. After the simmering time, strain the mixture through a cloth to remove any solids.
5. Transfer the strained liquid to a smaller pot.
6. Add the double refined sugar and lemon juice to the pot.
7. Bring the mixture to a boil again, stirring constantly to dissolve the sugar.
8. Let the mixture simmer for a few minutes to allow the flavors to meld together.
9. Remove the pot from the heat and let the jelly cool slightly.
10. Pour the jelly into glass jars or molds.
11. Let the jelly cool completely, then refrigerate for several hours or overnight until set.
12. Serve the lemonade jelly chilled.

## Cooking time
Approximately 6 hours simmering time, plus additional time for cooling and setting.
