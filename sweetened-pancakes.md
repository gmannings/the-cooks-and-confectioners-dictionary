# Sweetened Pancakes

## Description
These sweetened pancakes are made with a thin batter of flour, cream, and butter. They are flavored with powdered mace and sweetened with sugar. The pancakes are baked on hot irons and then rolled off onto a small stick.

## Ingredients:
- 200g flour
- 200ml cream
- 50g butter, melted
- 1/2 teaspoon powdered mace
- 2 tablespoons sugar

## Instructions:
1. Preheat a pancake griddle or a non-stick frying pan over medium heat.
2. In a mixing bowl, combine the flour, cream, melted butter, powdered mace, and sugar. Stir until well combined and the batter is smooth.
3. Lightly butter the griddle or frying pan.
4. Using a teaspoon, drop small amounts of the batter onto the hot griddle or frying pan, spacing them apart.
5. Cook the pancakes for about 2-3 minutes on each side, or until golden brown.
6. Using a spatula, carefully flip the pancakes and cook the other side until golden brown.
7. Once cooked, use a small stick or skewer to roll the pancakes off the griddle or frying pan.
8. Serve the sweetened pancakes warm with your choice of toppings, such as maple syrup, honey, or fresh fruit.

## Cooking time
Approximately 15-20 minutes.
