# Marinated Soles

## Description
Marinated Soles is a dish made with sole fish that has been marinated, fried, and served with a flavorful pickle. The fish is coated in a mixture of beaten eggs and flour, then fried until golden. The pickle is made with white wine vinegar, salt, pepper, nutmeg, cloves, and mace. The dish is garnished with fennel, flowers, and lemon peel.

## Ingredients:
- 4 sole fillets
- 2 eggs
- 2 tablespoons flour
- Vegetable oil, for frying
- 1 cup white wine vinegar
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 1/2 teaspoon pepper
- 1/2 teaspoon nutmeg
- 1/4 teaspoon cloves
- 1/4 teaspoon mace
- Fennel, for garnish
- Flowers, for garnish
- Lemon peel, for garnish

## Instructions:
1. Wash the sole fillets and pat them dry with a clean kitchen towel.
2. Place the fillets on a cutting board and gently pound them with a rolling pin to flatten them slightly.
3. In a shallow bowl, beat the eggs with a fork until well combined.
4. Add the flour to the beaten eggs and mix until smooth.
5. Dip each sole fillet into the egg and flour mixture, coating both sides evenly.
6. Heat vegetable oil in a frying pan over medium heat.
7. Fry the coated sole fillets in the hot oil until they turn a bright yellow color and become crispy. This should take about 2-3 minutes per side.
8. Remove the fried sole fillets from the pan and place them on a paper towel-lined plate to drain excess oil and cool.
9. In a separate saucepan, combine the white wine vinegar, salt, pepper, nutmeg, cloves, and mace. Bring the mixture to a boil and let it simmer for a few minutes to infuse the flavors.
10. Transfer the marinated sole fillets to a shallow dish and pour the hot pickle over them, ensuring that the fillets are fully covered.
11. Allow the marinated soles to cool to room temperature, then refrigerate for at least 1 hour to let the flavors develop.
12. To serve, arrange the marinated soles on a platter and garnish with fennel, flowers, and lemon peel.
