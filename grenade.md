# Grenade

## Description
Grenade is a dish made with fricandoes or Scotch collops, larded with small strips of bacon, and baked in a round stew-pan. The dish is named after its resemblance to a grenade or pomegranate. It is a rich and flavorful dish, filled with a ragout of pigeons, veal sweetbreads, mushrooms, truffles, and bacon.

## Ingredients:
- 1 pork loin
- Bacon, thinly sliced
- White of 1 egg, beaten
- Farce of Mirotons or other stuffing mixture
- 6 pigeons, dressed in a ragout
- Veal sweetbreads
- Mushrooms
- Truffles
- Salt and pepper, to taste

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F).
2. Line the bottom of a round stew-pan with thin slices of bacon.
3. Arrange the fricandoes or Scotch collops in the stew-pan, with the bacon on the outside, so that they meet in a point in the middle and touch each other.
4. Bind the fricandoes or collops together with the beaten egg white to keep them in place.
5. Fill the hollow place in the middle and around the sides with a little of the farce of Mirotons or other stuffing mixture.
6. Reserve the middle for the pigeons dressed in a ragout, along with veal sweetbreads, mushrooms, truffles, and thin slices of bacon. Season the ragout mixture with salt and pepper.
7. Pour the ragout mixture into the hollow place in the stew-pan.
8. Cover the rest of the farce on top, shaping it with your fingers dipped in beaten egg.
9. Lay some thin slices of bacon on top of the farce.
10. Bake the stew-pan in the preheated oven for approximately 1 hour, or until the meat is cooked through and the bacon is crispy.
11. When serving, turn the stew-pan upside down to remove any excess fat.
12. Open the point of the fricandoes or collops to resemble a grenade or pomegranate.
