# Dried Pippin Apples

## Description
Dried Pippin Apples are a classic 18th-century treat made by drying apple slices in the oven. The result is a sweet and chewy snack that can be enjoyed on its own or used in various recipes.

## Options and commentary
- You can use any variety of apples that are suitable for baking, such as Granny Smith or Honeycrisp.
- Adjust the amount of apples based on how many you want to make and the size of your oven.
- You can sprinkle some cinnamon or sugar on the apple slices before drying them for added flavor.

## Ingredients:
- Apples (Pippin or any baking variety)

## Instructions:
1. Preheat your oven to 200°C (400°F).
2. Wash and core the apples. Slice them into thin, even slices, about 1/4 inch thick.
3. Arrange the apple slices in a single layer on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper or a silicone baking mat. Make sure the slices are not touching each other.
4. Place the baking sheet in the preheated oven and bake for about 1 hour.
5. After 1 hour, flip the apple slices over and continue baking for another hour.
6. Check the apple slices for doneness. They should be dry and slightly chewy, but not overly crispy. If they are not fully dried, continue baking for another 30 minutes, checking every 10 minutes.
7. Once the apple slices are fully dried, remove them from the oven and let them cool completely on the baking sheet.
8. Store the dried apple slices in an airtight container or jar.

## Cooking time
Approximately 2-2.5 hours, depending on the thickness of the apple slices and desired level of dryness.
