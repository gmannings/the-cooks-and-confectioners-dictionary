# Milk Punch

## Description
Milk Punch is a creamy and refreshing alcoholic beverage that originated in the 18th century. It is made by combining brandy, water, lemon juice, sugar, and milk. The mixture is strained multiple times to achieve a clear and fine consistency.

## Ingredients:
- 1 liter of good brandy
- 1 liter of water
- 9 lemons
- 225 grams of double-refined sugar
- 375 ml of whole milk

## Instructions:
1. In a large pitcher or bowl, combine the brandy and water.
2. Juice the lemons and add the lemon juice to the brandy-water mixture.
3. Add the double-refined sugar to the mixture and stir until the sugar is dissolved.
4. Pour in the whole milk and stir well to combine.
5. Place a fine-mesh strainer over another pitcher or bowl.
6. Slowly pour the milk punch mixture through the strainer, allowing the liquid to pass through while catching any solids or impurities.
7. Repeat the straining process at least two more times, using a clean strainer each time, until the milk punch is clear and free of any particles.
8. Transfer the strained milk punch into a clean bottle or container.
9. Refrigerate the milk punch for at least 4 hours or overnight to allow the flavors to meld and the mixture to chill.
10. Serve the milk punch chilled in glasses or over ice.
