# Boiled Pike with Lemon Butter Sauce

## Description
This recipe is a modernized version of an 18th-century French recipe for boiled pike. The pike is boiled in a mixture of wine and water, flavored with lemon peel. It is then served on sippets (small pieces of toasted bread) and topped with a lemon butter sauce. The dish is garnished with barberries, sliced ginger, and lemon peel.

## Ingredients:
- 1 pike (approximately 1 kg)
- 500 ml white wine
- 500 ml water
- 1 lemon, peel removed in strips
- Salt
- 100 g butter
- 100 ml water
- 2-3 lemons, sliced
- 2-3 egg yolks
- 1/2 teaspoon grated nutmeg
- Sippets (small pieces of toasted bread)
- Barberries, for garnish
- Sliced ginger, for garnish
- Lemon peel, for garnish

## Instructions:
1. Cut the pike into three pieces.
2. In a large pot, combine the white wine, water, and lemon peel. Bring to a boil.
3. Add the pike and a good handful of salt to the boiling liquid.
4. Reduce the heat to a simmer and cook the pike for about 15-20 minutes, or until it is cooked through and flakes easily with a fork.
5. While the pike is cooking, prepare the lemon butter sauce. In a small saucepan, melt the butter over medium heat.
6. Add the water, lemon slices, egg yolks, and grated nutmeg to the melted butter. Whisk continuously until the sauce thickens and becomes smooth.
7. Remove the pike from the cooking liquid and place it on a serving platter.
8. Arrange the sippets around the pike and stick some fried bread on top.
9. Pour the lemon butter sauce over the pike and sippets.
10. Garnish the dish with barberries, sliced ginger, and lemon peel.
