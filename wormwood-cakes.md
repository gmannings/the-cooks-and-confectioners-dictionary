# Wormwood Cakes

## Description
Wormwood Cakes are small, sweet cakes that were traditionally used to soothe a cold stomach. They are made by combining sugar, wormwood-infused spirit, gum tragacanth, rose water, and a touch of musk. The mixture is then shaped into small cakes and baked until dry.

## Ingredients:
- 2 ounces (56 grams) fine sugar
- Spirit of wormwood (available at specialty liquor stores)
- Gum tragacanth
- Rose water
- A pinch of musk (optional)

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to a moderate temperature.

2. In a small bowl, combine the fine sugar and enough spirit of wormwood to create a thick paste. Stir well to ensure the sugar is fully dissolved.

3. In a separate bowl, soak gum tragacanth in rose water until it becomes soft and pliable.

4. Take a small amount of the wormwood-infused sugar mixture and a small amount of the soaked gum tragacanth. Place them in a stone mortar.

5. Using a pestle, pound and mix the ingredients together until they form a dough-like paste. If desired, add a pinch of musk for additional flavor.

6. Once the paste is well combined, shape it into small cakes about the size of a sixpence (approximately 2 centimeters in diameter).

7. Place the cakes on tinplates or a baking sheet lined with parchment paper.

8. Place the tinplates or baking sheet in the preheated oven and bake the cakes until they are dry. This will take approximately 15-20 minutes.

9. Once the cakes are dry, remove them from the oven and allow them to cool completely.

10. Store the Wormwood Cakes in an airtight container for future use.

## Cooking time
