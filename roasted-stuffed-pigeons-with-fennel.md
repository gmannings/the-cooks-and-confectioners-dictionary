# Roasted Stuffed Pigeons with Fennel

## Description
This recipe is for roasted pigeons that are stuffed with a flavorful mixture of pigeon livers, bacon, herbs, and fennel. The pigeons are then roasted and served with a delicious sauce poured over them.

## Ingredients:
- 4 pigeons
- 4 pigeon livers
- 4 slices of bacon
- 2 tablespoons chopped chives
- 2 tablespoons chopped parsley
- 2 tablespoons chopped fennel
- Salt and pepper to taste
- 1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg
- For the sauce:
  - 1 cup chicken or vegetable broth
  - 2 tablespoons butter
  - 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
  - Salt and pepper to taste

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 180째C (350째F).
2. Truss the pigeons by tying their legs together with kitchen twine.
3. Singe the pigeons by holding them over an open flame briefly to remove any remaining feathers. Be careful not to burn the skin.
4. In a food processor, combine the pigeon livers, bacon, chives, parsley, and fennel. Pulse until finely minced.
5. Season the mixture with salt, pepper, and nutmeg. Mix well.
6. Stuff the pigeon bodies with the prepared mixture, dividing it evenly among the pigeons.
7. Place the stuffed pigeons on a roasting rack set in a roasting pan.
8. Roast the pigeons in the preheated oven for about 25-30 minutes, or until the internal temperature reaches 65째C (150째F) for medium-rare.
9. While the pigeons are roasting, prepare the sauce. In a small saucepan, melt the butter over medium heat.
10. Add the flour to the melted butter and cook, stirring constantly, for 1-2 minutes to make a roux.
11. Gradually whisk in the chicken or vegetable broth until the sauce is smooth. Cook for another 2-3 minutes, or until the sauce thickens.
12. Season the sauce with salt and pepper to taste.
13. Once the pigeons are cooked, remove them from the oven and let them rest for a few minutes.
14. Serve the roasted pigeons with the sauce poured over them.
