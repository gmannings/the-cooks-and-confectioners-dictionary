# Cider

## Description
This recipe is for making cider, a refreshing alcoholic beverage made from apples. The process involves grinding or stomping the apples, pressing them in a hair bag, and allowing the cider to ferment for a few days. The cider is then transferred to vessels for storage and left to ferment further in a cellar.

## Options and commentary
- You can choose to either grind or stomp the apples. Grinding the apples will require a cider press or a food processor, while stomping can be done by placing the apples in a clean container and using your feet to crush them.
- The type of apples used will affect the flavor of the cider. Choose a variety that is suitable for cider making, such as cider apples or a mix of sweet and tart apples.
- The fermentation process can take anywhere from a few days to a few weeks, depending on the desired flavor and alcohol content of the cider.

## Ingredients:
- Apples (enough to fill your desired volume of cider)
- Hair bag or cheesecloth

## Instructions:
1. Wash and sanitize all equipment, including the hair bag or cheesecloth, containers, and any utensils you will be using.
2. If using a cider press, grind the apples and press the pulp to extract the juice. If stomping, place the apples in a clean container and use your feet or a clean tool to crush them until they release their juice.
3. Transfer the apple pulp or juice to a hair bag or cheesecloth. Tie the bag securely, ensuring that no pulp escapes.
4. Place the bag of apple pulp or juice in a clean, open vessel. Make sure the vessel is not completely full, leaving some space for the cider to expand during fermentation.
5. Cover the vessel with an open bung or a loose cover. This will allow for evaporation of volatile spirits during fermentation.
6. Let the cider stand in the open vessel for a day or two, allowing any coarse particles to settle at the bottom.
7. After the initial settling period, transfer the cider to the vessels you intend to store it in. Leave about an eighth of the vessel empty to allow for further fermentation and expansion.
8. Place the vessels in a cellar or cool, dark place. Keep the bungs open or cover them loosely to allow for the release of gases during fermentation.
9. Allow the cider to ferment for the desired period of time, typically a few days to a few weeks. The longer the fermentation, the stronger and more complex the flavor of the cider will be.
10. Once the fermentation is complete, close the bungs tightly or seal the vessels to prevent further fermentation and preserve the cider.
11. Store the cider in a cool place, such as a cellar or refrigerator, until ready to serve.

## Cooking time
- Grinding or stomping the apples: 30 minutes to 1 hour
- Initial settling period: 1-2 days
- Fermentation: a few days to a few weeks
- Storage: indefinite, but best consumed within a year for optimal flavor
