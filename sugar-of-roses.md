# Sugar of Roses

## Description
Sugar of Roses is a sweet and fragrant confection made from dried rose petals and sugar. It was a popular treat in the 18th century and can still be enjoyed today as a unique and delicate dessert.

## Ingredients:
- Red roses (the deepest colored)
- 1 pound of sugar, finely powdered
- Water
- Rose powder (made from dried rose petals)

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to a low temperature.
2. Pick the red roses, making sure to choose the deepest colored ones.
3. Cut off the white bottoms of the roses.
4. Spread the rose leaves on a baking sheet and place them in the preheated oven to dry. This will take a few hours, so be patient.
5. Once the rose leaves are completely dry, remove them from the oven and let them cool.
6. Pound the dried rose leaves in a mortar until they are finely crushed.
7. Sift the crushed rose leaves to remove any larger pieces.
8. In a saucepan, combine the finely powdered sugar with just enough water to wet it. Stir until the sugar is dissolved.
9. Place the saucepan over a chafing dish of coals or a low heat source.
10. Allow the sugar mixture to boil until it reaches the consistency of sugar again. This may take some time, so keep an eye on it and stir occasionally.
11. Once the sugar has reached the desired consistency, add the rose powder to the mixture. Stir well to incorporate the rose powder and create a vibrant red color.
12. Remove the saucepan from the heat and let the sugar mixture cool completely.
13. Once the sugar is thoroughly cold, transfer it to boxes for storage and future use.
