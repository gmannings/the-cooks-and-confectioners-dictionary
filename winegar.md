- Rapes (grapes) or husks of grapes

## Instructions:
1. Take a middling fort of beer (approximately 36 liters) that is indifferently well hopped.

3. Mash some rapes (grapes) or husks of grapes together in a tub.
4. Add the mashed grapes or grape husks to the fermented beer in the tub.

7. Transfer the liquid into a cask.
8. Place the cask in a sunny location, ensuring that the bung is covered with a tile to allow air circulation.
