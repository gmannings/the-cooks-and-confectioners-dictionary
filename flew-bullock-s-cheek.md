# Flew Bullock's Cheek

## Description
This recipe involves slow-cooking a bullock's cheek in a flavorful broth until it becomes tender and flavorful. The cheek is first roasted to develop a rich flavor, then simmered in a mixture of claret wine, strong broth, and aromatic spices. The resulting dish is served on sippets (small pieces of toasted bread) with the cooking liquid.

## Ingredients:
- 1 bullock's cheek (approximately 1 kg)
- Salt and pepper to taste
- 1 onion, sliced
- 2 shallots, sliced
- 500 ml claret wine
- 500 ml strong beef broth
- 1 teaspoon ground ginger
- 1/2 teaspoon sliced nutmeg
- Sippets (small pieces of toasted bread) for serving

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to a high temperature.
2. Clean and bone the bullock's cheek.
3. Place the cheek on a roasting tray and season it with salt and pepper.
4. Roast the cheek in the preheated oven for about 20 minutes or until it is browned and slightly crispy on the outside.
5. Remove the cheek from the oven and let it cool slightly.
6. In a large pipkin or saucepan, combine the claret wine, strong beef broth, sliced onion, sliced shallots, ground ginger, and sliced nutmeg.
7. Place the pipkin or saucepan over medium heat and bring the mixture to a simmer.
8. Add the roasted bullock's cheek to the simmering liquid.
9. Reduce the heat to low and cover the pipkin or saucepan with a lid.
10. Let the cheek simmer in the liquid for approximately 2 hours or until it becomes tender and easily pulls apart.
11. Remove the cheek from the liquid and set it aside.
12. Strain the cooking liquid to remove the onion and shallot slices.
13. Return the strained liquid to the pipkin or saucepan and bring it to a gentle boil.
14. Cook the liquid until it reduces and thickens slightly to create a flavorful gravy.
15. Slice the cooked bullock's cheek into thin strips.
16. Place sippets on serving plates and arrange the sliced cheek on top.
17. Pour the reduced cooking liquid over the cheek and sippets.
18. Serve the flew bullock's cheek immediately.
