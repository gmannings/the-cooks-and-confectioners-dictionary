# Peas-loop

## Description
Peas-loop is a hearty and flavorful soup made with beef broth, peas, and a variety of vegetables and herbs. It is traditionally served with roasted larded pigeons as a garnish.

## Options and commentary
- Instead of a leg of beef, you can use beef broth or stock for convenience.
- Feel free to adjust the seasoning according to your taste preferences.
- You can add other vegetables such as carrots, celery, or potatoes to the soup.
- If you don't have access to larded pigeons, you can omit them or substitute with roasted chicken or duck.

## Ingredients:
- 1 leg of beef or 1 liter beef broth/stock
- 500g hulled peas
- 1 onion
- 4 cloves
- Salt, to taste
- Pepper, to taste
- Spice blend (such as a mix of cinnamon, nutmeg, and cloves)
- Assorted savory herbs (such as leek, spinach, sorrel, lettuce, and roots)
- 100g bacon, cut into small pieces
- 100g crispy bacon, for garnish
- 4 slices of toasted bread, for garnish
- Forcemeat balls (optional)
- 500ml good gravy

## Instructions:
1. If using a leg of beef, place it in a large pot and cover with water. Bring to a boil and let it simmer for several hours until the beef is tender and the broth is flavorful. If using beef broth/stock, skip this step.
2. Once the beef broth is ready, let it cool completely.
3. In a large pot, combine the cooled beef broth, hulled peas, onion stuck with cloves, and a generous amount of salt, pepper, and spice blend.
4. Bring the mixture to a boil and then reduce the heat to a simmer. Cook until the peas are tender, stirring occasionally.
5. While the peas are cooking, prepare the garnishes. In a separate pan, cook the small pieces of bacon until crispy. Set aside.
6. Toast the bread slices until golden brown. Set aside.
7. If using forcemeat balls, prepare them according to your preferred recipe.
8. Once the peas are tender, add the savory herbs, bacon pieces, and good gravy to the pot. Stir well to combine.
9. Continue to simmer the soup for another 10-15 minutes to allow the flavors to meld together.
10. While the soup is simmering, roast the larded pigeons in the oven until cooked through.
11. To serve, ladle the soup into bowls and garnish with the roasted larded pigeons, crispy bacon, toasted bread, and forcemeat balls if desired.

## Cooking time
- Cooking the beef broth: several hours
- Cooking the peas and assembling the soup: approximately 1 hour
