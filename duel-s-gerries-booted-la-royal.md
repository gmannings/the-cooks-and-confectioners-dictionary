# Duel's Gerries Booted à la Royal

## Description
This recipe is for a sweet and tangy cherry preserve. The cherries are cooked in a sugar syrup and then dried in a stove. It is a delicious and elegant treat that can be enjoyed on its own or used as a topping for desserts.

## Options and commentary
- You can use any type of cherries for this recipe, but the finest Kentish cherries are recommended for their flavor and texture.
- If you don't have access to a stove, you can dry the cherries in a low-temperature oven instead.
- This recipe calls for preserving cherries in ears, which refers to preserving them with the stems intact. If you can't find cherries with stems, you can skip this step or use cherries with the stems removed.

## Ingredients:
- 1 kg cherries
- 1 kg sugar

## Instructions:
1. Wash the cherries and remove any stems or leaves.
2. In a large pot, combine the sugar with enough water to cover it. Heat over medium heat until the sugar has dissolved completely.
3. Increase the heat to high and bring the sugar syrup to a boil. Continue boiling until the syrup reaches the second degree, also known as the pearl stage. This is when the syrup forms small pearls when dropped into cold water.
4. Add the cherries to the boiling syrup and stir gently to coat them evenly. Cook the cherries in the syrup for about 5 minutes, stirring occasionally.
5. Remove the cherries from the syrup using a slotted spoon and transfer them to a wire rack or a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Make sure to leave some space between the cherries so that they can dry evenly.
6. Place the cherries in a stove or a low-temperature oven (around 50°C) and let them dry for several hours or overnight. The cherries should be slightly shriveled and no longer sticky when they are done.

## Cooking time
- Cooking the cherries in the syrup: about 5 minutes
- Drying the cherries in the stove or oven: several hours or overnight
