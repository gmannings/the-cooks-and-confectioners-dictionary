## Ingredients:
- 1 kg pork loin or pork belly
- 500 g veal, thinly sliced
- 2 tablespoons chopped sage
- 2 tablespoons chopped parsley
- 1 tablespoon chopped thyme
- 1 tablespoon chopped sweet marjoram
- Salt and pepper to taste
- 1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg
- 1/2 teaspoon ground mace
- 4 egg yolks
- 2 tablespoons vinegar
- Bay leaves or rosemary sprigs, for garnish
- Edible flowers, for garnish (optional)

## Instructions:
1. Place the pork in a large bowl and cover it with water. Let it soak overnight to remove any blood. 
2. In a separate bowl, combine the chopped sage, parsley, thyme, and sweet marjoram. Season with salt and pepper to taste.
3. Lay the veal slices on a cutting board and score them with a knife. Season with salt, pepper, nutmeg, and mace.
4. Drain the pork and pat it dry with paper towels. Brush the inside of the pork with the egg yolks.
5. Place the seasoned veal slices on top of the pork, covering the entire surface.
6. Sprinkle the remaining seasoning mixture over the veal.
7. Roll up the pork tightly, starting from one end. Secure the roll with kitchen twine or cooking tape.
8. Place the pork roll in a large pot and cover it with water. Bring the water to a boil and then reduce the heat to a simmer.
9. Cook the pork roll for about 2-3 hours, or until it is cooked through and tender. 
10. Once cooked, remove the pork roll from the pot and let it cool completely.
11. In a separate bowl, mix together the vinegar, beaten pepper, and ginger. Add a little bit of the cooking liquid from the pot to create a sauce.
12. Place the cooled pork roll in a container and pour the sauce over it. Let it marinate in the refrigerator for at least 4 hours, or overnight.
13. When ready to serve, remove the pork roll from the marinade and slice it thinly.
14. Garnish the sliced pork with bay leaves or rosemary sprigs. You can also add edible flowers for an extra touch.
15. Serve the collared pork cold as part of a buffet or picnic spread.
