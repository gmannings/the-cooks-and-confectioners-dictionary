# Fried Tongues

## Description
This recipe is for frying tongues, either calves tongues or sheep tongues. The tongues are boiled, peeled, and sliced before being coated in a mixture of beaten egg yolks, salt, cinnamon, nutmeg, sugar, and currants. The coated tongues are then fried in a pan until golden brown. They are served on sippets (small pieces of toasted bread) with a sauce made of sweet butter, sack (a type of fortified wine), and sugar. The dish is finished with a sprinkle of sugar on top.

## Options and commentary
- You can use either calves tongues or sheep tongues for this recipe.
- Sippets can be made by toasting small pieces of bread until crisp.
- Sweet butter can be substituted with regular unsalted butter.
- Sack can be replaced with a sweet white wine or a sweet sherry.

## Ingredients:
- 4 calves tongues or sheep tongues
- 4 egg yolks
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon
- 1/4 teaspoon nutmeg
- 1 tablespoon sugar
- 1/4 cup currants
- Butter for frying
- 4 sippets (small pieces of toasted bread)
- 2 tablespoons sweet butter
- 2 tablespoons sack (or sweet white wine/sherry)
- 1 tablespoon sugar (for sprinkling)

## Instructions:
1. Boil the tongues in a large pot of water until tender. This will take approximately 1-2 hours for calves tongues and 2-3 hours for sheep tongues. 
2. Once the tongues are cooked, remove them from the pot and allow them to cool slightly.
3. Peel the tongues by gently removing the outer skin. It should come off easily.
4. Slice the tongues into thin slices.
5. In a bowl, beat the egg yolks with the salt, cinnamon, nutmeg, sugar, and currants until well combined.
6. Heat a large frying pan over medium heat and add enough butter to coat the bottom of the pan.
7. Dip each tongue slice into the egg mixture, making sure it is well coated.
8. Place the coated tongue slices into the frying pan, taking care not to overcrowd the pan. Fry them in batches if necessary.
9. Cook the tongue slices until they are golden brown on both sides, flipping them halfway through. This will take approximately 2-3 minutes per side.
10. Remove the fried tongue slices from the pan and place them on a paper towel-lined plate to drain any excess oil.
11. In a small saucepan, melt the sweet butter over low heat. Add the sack (or sweet white wine/sherry) and sugar, stirring until the sugar has dissolved and the sauce is well combined.
12. Place a sippet on each serving plate and arrange the fried tongue slices on top.
13. Drizzle the sauce over the tongue slices and sprinkle with sugar.
14. Serve the fried tongues hot.
