# Sweetbread Ragout with Orange Juice

## Description
This recipe is a modernized version of an 18th-century dish called "Cullis." It features tender sweetbreads cooked in a flavorful ragout and finished with a tangy orange juice. Sweetbreads are delicate and creamy organ meats that add a rich and luxurious taste to the dish.

## Ingredients:
- 2 sweetbreads
- 2 tablespoons butter
- 1 onion, finely chopped
- 2 cloves of garlic, minced
- 1 carrot, diced
- 1 celery stalk, diced
- 1 cup chicken or vegetable broth
- 1 tablespoon all-purpose flour
- Juice of 1 orange
- Salt and pepper to taste

## Instructions:
1. Start by preparing the sweetbreads. Soak them in cold water for about 1 hour to remove any impurities. Then, blanch the sweetbreads by placing them in a pot of boiling water for 5 minutes. Drain and rinse under cold water to cool them down.
2. Once the sweetbreads are cooled, remove any excess fat or membranes. Cut them into bite-sized pieces and set aside.
3. In a large skillet, melt the butter over medium heat. Add the chopped onion, minced garlic, diced carrot, and diced celery. Saut√© until the vegetables are softened and lightly browned.
4. Add the sweetbread pieces to the skillet and cook for a few minutes until they are lightly browned on all sides.
5. Sprinkle the flour over the sweetbreads and vegetables, stirring well to coat everything evenly. Cook for another minute to cook off the raw flour taste.
6. Gradually pour in the chicken or vegetable broth, stirring constantly to prevent lumps from forming. Bring the mixture to a simmer and let it cook for about 10 minutes, or until the sauce has thickened slightly.
7. Season the ragout with salt and pepper to taste. If desired, you can also add some herbs like thyme or parsley for extra flavor.
8. Just before serving, squeeze the juice of one orange into the ragout. Stir well to incorporate the citrusy flavor.
9. Transfer the sweetbread ragout to a serving dish and serve hot.
