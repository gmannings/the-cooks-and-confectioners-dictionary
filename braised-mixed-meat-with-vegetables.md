# Braised Mixed Meat with Vegetables

## Description
This recipe is a hearty and flavorful dish that combines various meats with vegetables. The meats are baked or stewed in an earthen pan called a terrine, along with bacon, to keep them moist and add a smoky flavor. The dish is then stewed further with veal gravy, boiled lettuce, green pea soup, and either green peas or asparagus tops. The result is a rich and satisfying meal.

## Options and commentary
- You can use any combination of meats you prefer, such as quails, pigeons, chickens, and mutton. Adjust the quantities according to your preference and the number of servings you need.
- If you don't have a terrine, you can use a deep oven-safe dish or a Dutch oven.
- Feel free to add other vegetables of your choice, such as carrots or potatoes, to enhance the dish.
- You can use store-bought veal gravy or make your own by simmering veal bones with vegetables and herbs.
- If you don't have green pea soup, you can substitute with vegetable or chicken broth.

## Ingredients:
- Half a dozen quails
- 4 pigeons
- 2 chickens
- 1 breast of mutton, cut into pieces
- Bacon, sliced or diced
- Veal gravy
- Lettuce, boiled
- Green pea soup
- Green peas or asparagus tops

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F).
2. In an earthen pan or a deep oven-safe dish, place a layer of bacon slices or diced bacon at the bottom to prevent the meats from burning.
3. Arrange the quails, pigeons, chickens, and mutton pieces in the pan, ensuring they are evenly distributed.
4. Place the pan between two fires or on the stovetop over medium heat to stew a la braise. Alternatively, cover the pan with a lid and bake in the preheated oven for about 2-3 hours, or until the meats are tender.
5. Once the meats are cooked, remove the pan from the heat or oven and drain off any excess fat.
6. Add the veal gravy, boiled lettuce, green pea soup, and green peas or asparagus tops to the pan.
7. Return the pan to the heat or oven and stew all the ingredients together for an additional 30 minutes, or until the flavors are well combined and the vegetables are tender.
8. Skim off any remaining fat from the surface of the dish.
9. Serve the braised mixed meat with vegetables hot at the table.
