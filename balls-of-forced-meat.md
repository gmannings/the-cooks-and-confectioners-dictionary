# Balls of Forced Meat

## Description
Balls of Forced Meat are a classic dish made with a mixture of lamb's liver, beef marrow, eggs, spinach, herbs, and spices. The mixture is formed into balls and then baked or fried until cooked through. These meatballs are flavorful and can be served as an appetizer or as part of a main course.

## Ingredients:
- 250g lamb's liver
- 250g beef marrow
- 6 eggs, yolks only
- 150g spinach, finely chopped
- 60g grated bread
- 2 tsp thyme, chopped
- 2 tsp savory, chopped
- 1/2 tsp ground mace
- 1/2 tsp ground cloves
- 1/2 tsp ground black pepper
- Salt, to taste

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F).

2. In a pot of boiling water, blanch the lamb's liver for 2-3 minutes to remove any impurities. Drain and let it cool.

3. Finely shred the lamb's liver and beef marrow.

4. In a large mixing bowl, combine the shredded lamb's liver, beef marrow, egg yolks, chopped spinach, grated bread, thyme, savory, mace, cloves, black pepper, and salt. Mix well until all the ingredients are evenly incorporated.

5. Take small portions of the mixture and shape them into balls, about the size of a golf ball.

6. Place the meatballs on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper.

7. Bake in the preheated oven for 20-25 minutes, or until the meatballs are cooked through and golden brown.

8. Remove from the oven and let the meatballs cool slightly before serving.
