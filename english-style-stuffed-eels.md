# English-style Stuffed Eels

## Description
This recipe is for a traditional English dish of stuffed eels. The eels are filled with a flavorful mixture of breadcrumbs, herbs, spices, and butter, then cooked either by grilling or roasting. The dish can be served with a white sauce made with vinegar, butter, white pepper, salt, capers, and anchovies, or simply with a squeeze of lemon juice.

## Ingredients:
- 2 eels
- 100g breadcrumbs
- 1 small bunch of chives, finely chopped
- 1 small bunch of parsley, finely chopped
- Salt and pepper to taste
- 1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg
- 1/2 teaspoon ground cloves
- 2 hard-boiled egg yolks, mashed
- 50g butter, softened
- 100ml white wine
- Juice of 1 lemon (for serving)

For the white sauce (optional):
- 50ml white vinegar
- 50g butter
- 1/2 teaspoon white pepper
- Salt to taste
- 1 tablespoon capers
- 2 anchovy fillets, finely chopped

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F) or preheat a grill to medium-high heat.

2. In a mixing bowl, combine the breadcrumbs, chopped chives, chopped parsley, salt, pepper, nutmeg, cloves, mashed egg yolks, and softened butter. Mix well until all the ingredients are evenly incorporated.

3. Prepare the eels by rubbing them with salt and then wiping them with a towel to remove the slime. Skin the eels and cut them into three or four pieces.

4. Place the eel pieces in a dish and pour the white wine over them. Let them marinate for a few minutes.

5. Take the eel pieces out of the dish and make notches on the backs and sides of each piece. Fill these notches with the prepared breadcrumb mixture, pressing it firmly into the eel.

6. Slip the stuffed eel pieces back into their skins and tie both ends with kitchen twine to secure the filling.

7. Prick the eel skins in several places with a fork to allow the flavors to penetrate.

8. If grilling, place the eel pieces on a preheated grill and cook for about 10-12 minutes per side, or until the eel is cooked through and the skin is crispy.

9. If roasting, place the eel pieces on a baking sheet and roast in the preheated oven for about 20-25 minutes, or until the eel is cooked through and the skin is crispy.

10. While the eel is cooking, prepare the white sauce (if desired). In a small saucepan, heat the white vinegar over medium heat. Add the butter, white pepper, and salt. Stir until the butter is melted and the sauce is well combined. Remove from heat and stir in the capers and chopped anchovies.

11. Once the eel is cooked, remove the skin and serve the stuffed eel pieces on a platter. Drizzle with the white sauce or squeeze fresh lemon juice over the top.
