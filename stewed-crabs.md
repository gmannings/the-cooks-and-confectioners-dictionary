# Stewed Crabs

## Description
Stewed crabs are a delicious seafood dish where the crab meat is cooked in a flavorful sauce and served in the crab shells. The meat is first boiled, then stewed with a mixture of claret wine, vinegar, salt, nutmeg, and butter. The sauce is thickened with butter and orange juice, giving it a rich and tangy flavor. The dish is garnished with the large claws and small legs of the crabs.

## Ingredients:
- 4 crabs
- 200 ml claret wine
- 50 ml vinegar
- 1 tsp salt
- 1/2 tsp nutmeg
- 50 g butter
- Juice of 2 oranges

## Instructions:
1. Fill a large pot with water and bring it to a boil.
2. Carefully place the crabs into the boiling water and cook for about 10 minutes, or until they turn bright red.
3. Remove the crabs from the pot and let them cool slightly.
4. Once the crabs are cool enough to handle, break off the claws and set them aside for garnishing.
5. Remove the meat from the bodies of the crabs, being careful to discard any shells or cartilage.
6. Strain the crab meat to remove any excess liquid.
7. In a pipkin or small saucepan, combine the strained crab meat, claret wine, vinegar, salt, nutmeg, and a piece of butter.
8. Place the saucepan over a gentle fire and let the mixture stew for about an hour, or until most of the liquid has evaporated and the meat is almost dry.
9. In a separate bowl, beat the remaining butter with the juice of the oranges until thick.
10. Add the orange-butter mixture to the stewed crab meat and stir well to combine.
11. Wash the crab shells thoroughly and place them on a serving dish.
12. Arrange the claws and small legs around the shells for garnishing.
13. Spoon the stewed crab meat into the shells.
14. Serve the stewed crabs immediately.
