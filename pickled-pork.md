# Pickled Pork

## Description
Pickled pork is a preserved meat dish that was commonly made in the 18th century. The pork is cured with a mixture of salt and spices, which helps to preserve it and enhance its flavor. This dish can be enjoyed on its own or used as an ingredient in various recipes.

## Options and commentary
- You can use any cut of pork for this recipe, such as pork loin or pork shoulder.
- If you prefer a milder flavor, you can reduce the amount of salt used in the curing mixture.
- Feel free to add other spices or herbs to the curing mixture to customize the flavor of the pickled pork.

## Ingredients:
- 1 kg pork loin or pork shoulder
- 50g salt
- 25g salt peter (potassium nitrate)
- 12.5g bay salt (optional)

## Instructions:
1. Bone the pork and cut it into pieces of a size that will fit comfortably in your container.
2. In a small bowl, mix together the salt, salt peter, and bay salt (if using).
3. Rub each piece of pork well with the salt peter mixture, ensuring that all sides are coated.
4. Take a container, such as a tub or pan, that is large enough to hold all the pork pieces. Sprinkle a layer of salt on the bottom of the container.
5. Place the pork pieces in the container, making sure they are packed tightly together. Sprinkle more salt over the pork, covering each piece completely. Fill any empty spaces on the sides with salt.
6. As the salt on the top layer starts to melt, sprinkle on more salt to ensure that the pork is fully covered.
7. Cover the container with a lid or plastic wrap and place it in a cool, dry place.
8. Allow the pork to cure for at least 1 week, or up to several weeks for a stronger flavor. Turn the pork pieces over every few days to ensure even curing.
9. After the desired curing time, the pickled pork is ready to be used. Rinse off any excess salt before cooking or using in recipes.

## Cooking time
- Curing time: 1 week to several weeks, depending on desired flavor intensity.
