# Broiled Eggs

## Description
Broiled eggs are a simple and quick dish that can be enjoyed for breakfast or as a light meal. The eggs are cooked in the oven or under a broiler until the whites are set and the yolks are still slightly runny. They are then served with a flavorful sauce made with gravy, vinegar, and spices.

## Options and commentary
- You can adjust the cooking time to achieve your desired level of doneness for the eggs.
- Feel free to customize the sauce by adding other spices or herbs according to your taste preferences.
