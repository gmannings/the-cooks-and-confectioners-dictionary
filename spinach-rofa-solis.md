# Spinach Rofa Solis

## Description
Spinach Rofa Solis is a dish made with boiled spinach, eggs, sugar, butter, cream, cordi-citron, salt, cinnamon, nutmeg, and a pastry crust. The spinach is mixed with the other ingredients to create a filling, which is then wrapped in a thin pastry and either boiled or fried. It can be served as a side dish or as part of a second course for supper.

## Ingredients:
- Boiled spinach (approx. 500g)
- 4 eggs
- Sugar (approx. 50g)
- Butter (approx. 50g)
- Cream (approx. 60ml)
- 2 ounces of candied citron (cordi-citron), finely minced
- Salt (to taste)
- Cinnamon (to taste)
- Nutmeg (to taste)
- Pastry dough:
  - 4 raw eggs
  - 4 tablespoons of milk
  - Sugar (approx. 30g)
  - Salt (to taste)
  - Flour (approx. 250g)

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F) if you plan to bake the pastries, or prepare a pot of boiling water if you plan to boil them.
2. In a large bowl, squeeze the boiled spinach to remove excess moisture. Finely shred the spinach.
3. Add the sugar, butter, cream, minced candied citron, salt, cinnamon, and nutmeg to the bowl with the spinach. Mix well to combine all the ingredients. Set aside to cool.
4. In a separate bowl, prepare the pastry dough. Beat the raw eggs and milk together. Add the sugar and salt, and mix well. Gradually add the flour, mixing until a dough forms.
5. On a lightly floured surface, roll out the pastry dough until it is thin, similar to the thickness of a tart crust.
6. Cut the pastry into square pieces, approximately 7-10 cm (3-4 inches) in size.
7. Place a spoonful of the spinach filling onto each square of pastry.
8. Fold the pastry over the filling to create a half-moon shape. Pinch the edges of the pastry together to seal it.
9. If boiling the pastries, carefully place them in the boiling water and cook for about 15 minutes. If frying, heat clarified butter or lard in a pan and fry the pastries until golden brown on both sides.
10. Optional: When serving, sprinkle grated bread and cheese over the boiled pastries, or sprinkle grated sugar over the fried pastries.
11. Serve the Spinach Rofa Solis as a side dish or as part of a second course for supper.
