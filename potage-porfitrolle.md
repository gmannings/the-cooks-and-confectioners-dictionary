# Potage Porfitrolle

## Description
Potage Porfitrolle is a traditional French dish made with a stuffed French loaf soaked in veal gravy and broth. It is then served with a rich cullis sauce made from the meats used to make the gravy. The dish is garnished with artichoke bottoms and mushrooms, and can be further enhanced with fricandoes or veal sweetbreads.

## Options and commentary
- Instead of a French loaf, you can use a baguette or any other crusty bread loaf.
- The stuffing can be made with a variety of ingredients such as ground meat, vegetables, herbs, and spices.
- You can use chicken or turkey broth instead of veal broth.
- Fricandoes are small pieces of meat cooked in a rich sauce, while veal sweetbreads are the thymus glands of a young calf. These garnishes are optional and can be omitted if desired.

## Ingredients:
- 1 French loaf (or baguette)
- Stuffing ingredients of your choice (e.g., ground meat, vegetables, herbs, spices)
- Veal gravy
- Good quality broth (veal, chicken, or turkey)
- Cullis sauce ingredients (meats used to make the gravy, strained)
- Artichoke bottoms
- Mushrooms
- Fricandoes or veal sweetbreads (optional)

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F).
2. Slice the French loaf lengthwise, leaving one side intact to create a pocket for the stuffing.
3. Prepare the stuffing by combining your chosen ingredients in a bowl. Season with salt, pepper, and any desired herbs or spices.
4. Stuff the French loaf with the prepared stuffing, ensuring it is evenly distributed.
5. Place the stuffed French loaf in a baking dish and pour veal gravy, followed by good quality broth, over it. Make sure the loaf is well soaked.
6. Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil and bake in the preheated oven for approximately 30 minutes, or until the loaf is heated through and the stuffing is cooked.
7. While the loaf is baking, prepare the cullis sauce. In a saucepan, combine the meats used to make the veal gravy with some additional broth. Simmer over low heat for about 20 minutes to extract the flavors.
8. Strain the cullis sauce to remove any solids, and pour it over the potage when serving.
9. When ready to serve, place a handsome artichoke bottom on top of the loaf, along with some mushrooms inside the pocket.
10. Garnish the dish with fricandoes or veal sweetbreads, if desired.

## Cooking time
Approximately 30 minutes for baking the stuffed loaf. Additional time required for preparing the cullis sauce.
