# Bisk of Quails and other Fowls

## Description
This recipe is for a rich and flavorful dish featuring quails and other fowls. The quails are first fried in burnt butter to give them a nice color, then cooked in a pot with broth, bacon, herbs, spices, beef steak, bacon, and lemon. The dish is served with a veal-cullis and lemon juice, and garnished with sweetbreads of veal, artichoke bottoms, mushrooms, and truffles.

## Ingredients:
- 4 quails
- 4 slices of bacon
- 1 bunch of fresh herbs (such as thyme, rosemary, and parsley)
- 4 cloves
- 1 beef steak, beaten
- 4 slices of lean bacon
- 1 green lemon

- Salt and pepper to taste
- Veal-cullis (for garnish)
- Lemon juice (for garnish)
- Sweetbreads of veal (for garnish)
- Artichoke bottoms (for garnish)
- Mushrooms (for garnish)

## Instructions:
1. Preheat a large frying pan over medium heat.
2. Add the slices of bacon to the pan and cook until crispy. Remove the bacon from the pan and set aside.
3. In the same pan, add the quails and fry them in the burnt butter until they acquire a nice color. Remove the quails from the pan and set aside.
4. In a small pot, combine the broth, slices of bacon, fresh herbs, cloves, beef steak, lean bacon, and green lemon.
5. Place the pot over a gentle fire and let it boil for about 1 hour, or until the quails are cooked through and tender.
6. While the quails are cooking, prepare the garnishes. Cook the sweetbreads of veal, artichoke bottoms, mushrooms, and truffles according to your preferred method.
7. Once the quails are cooked, remove them from the pot and set aside.
8. Strain the broth mixture to remove any solids, then return the broth to the pot.
9. Add the veal-cullis and lemon juice to the pot and stir well to combine.
10. Return the quails to the pot and let them simmer in the broth for a few minutes to absorb the flavors.
11. To serve, place a quail in each serving bowl and ladle the broth over the top. Garnish with the cooked sweetbreads of veal, artichoke bottoms, mushrooms, and truffles.
12. Serve hot and enjoy!
