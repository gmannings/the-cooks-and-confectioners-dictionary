# Boiling Sugar

## Description
This recipe provides instructions for boiling sugar to different stages of consistency, including smooth, pearled, blown, feathered, crack'd, and caramel. Each stage of boiling sugar has its own characteristics and uses in confectionery.

## Options and commentary
- The different stages of boiling sugar allow for a variety of confectionery creations, such as candies, syrups, and decorations.
- It is important to closely monitor the temperature of the sugar while boiling to achieve the desired consistency.
- Use caution when working with hot sugar, as it can cause severe burns.

## Ingredients:
- Granulated sugar

## Instructions:
1. Place a heavy-bottomed saucepan over medium heat.
2. Add the granulated sugar to the saucepan.
3. Stir the sugar continuously with a heat-resistant spatula until it begins to melt.
4. As the sugar melts, it will start to turn into a liquid. Continue stirring to ensure even heat distribution.
5. Use a candy thermometer to monitor the temperature of the sugar. The desired temperature will depend on the stage of boiling you want to achieve:
   - Smooth: 110°C (230°F)
   - Pearled: 115°C (240°F)
   - Blown: 120°C (250°F)
   - Feathered: 125°C (257°F)
   - Crack'd: 150°C (302°F)
   - Caramel: 170°C (338°F)
6. Once the sugar reaches the desired temperature, remove the saucepan from heat immediately.
7. Be careful as the sugar will be extremely hot. Handle with oven mitts or heat-resistant gloves.
8. If using the sugar immediately, carefully pour or shape it as desired.
9. If not using the sugar immediately, pour it onto a silicone mat or greased baking sheet to cool and harden.
10. Once the sugar has cooled and hardened, it can be stored in an airtight container until ready to use.

## Cooking time
The cooking time will vary depending on the desired stage of boiling and the heat intensity. It is important to closely monitor the temperature of the sugar throughout the process.
