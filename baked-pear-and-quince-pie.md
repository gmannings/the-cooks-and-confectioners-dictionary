# Baked Pear and Quince Pie

## Description
This recipe is a modernized version of an 18th-century recipe for a baked pear and quince pie. The pears and quinces are baked together in a pie crust with a combination of spices, sugar, and lemon peel. The pie is then finished with a sweet syrup made with sugar, rose water, and cinnamon. It can be served hot or cold as a delicious dessert.

## Options and commentary
- You can use any variety of hard winter pears for this recipe, such as Bosc or Anjou.
- If quinces are not available, you can substitute with apples or additional pears.
- Feel free to adjust the amount of sugar and spices according to your taste preferences.
- This pie can be served with a dollop of whipped cream or a scoop of vanilla ice cream for added indulgence.

## Ingredients:
- 4 hard winter pears
- 2 quinces (or substitute with apples or additional pears)
- 1 pie crust (store-bought or homemade)
- 6 whole cloves
- 1 cinnamon stick
- 1/4 cup sugar
- 1 tablespoon lemon peel, shaved
- 1/4 cup sugar, for syrup
- 1 tablespoon rose water
- 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F).
2. Peel the pears and quinces, then cut them in half. Remove the cores from the pears and quinces.
3. Roll out the pie crust and line a pie dish with it.
4. Arrange the pear and quince halves in the pie crust, alternating between them. Place slices of quinces, whole cloves, cinnamon stick, sugar, and lemon peel between the fruit halves.
5. Cover the pie with another layer of pie crust, sealing the edges. Make a few small slits on the top crust to allow steam to escape.
6. Place the pie in the preheated oven and bake for about 45 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown and the fruit is tender.
7. While the pie is baking, prepare the syrup. In a small saucepan, combine the sugar, rose water, and ground cinnamon. Heat over low heat until the sugar has dissolved, stirring occasionally.
8. Once the pie is baked, remove it from the oven and carefully lift one side of the crust to create a small opening. Pour the syrup into the pie through the opening, allowing it to soak into the fruit.
9. Let the pie cool slightly before serving. It can be enjoyed warm or chilled in the refrigerator for a few hours before serving.
