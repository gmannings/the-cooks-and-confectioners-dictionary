## Description
Pupton of Salmon is a dish made with minced salmon, eels, mushrooms, herbs, and spices, all encased in a creamy custard-like filling and baked. It is a rich and flavorful dish that can be served as a main course.

- If eels are not available, you can omit them or substitute with another type of fish.
- You can adjust the seasoning according to your taste preferences.
- The dish can be served with a sauce of your choice, such as a lemon butter sauce or a creamy dill sauce.

## Ingredients:
- 500g salmon fillets, skin removed
- 200g eel fillets, skin removed (optional)
- 200g mushrooms, finely minced
- 2 tablespoons fresh chives, chopped
- 2 tablespoons fresh parsley, chopped
- Salt and pepper to taste
- 1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg
- 1/2 teaspoon dried basil
- 50g butter, softened
- 1 slice of bread, crust removed
- 200ml cream or milk
- 4 eggs, separated
- 3 cloves
- 1 teaspoon coriander seeds
- 2 tablespoons flour
- 200ml fish broth
- 1 small bunch of fresh herbs (such as thyme, parsley, and bay leaves)
- 100g crayfish tails
- 100g blanched asparagus tips

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F).
2. In a large bowl, combine the minced salmon, minced eels (if using), minced mushrooms, chives, parsley, salt, pepper, nutmeg, and dried basil. Mix well until all the ingredients are evenly distributed.
3. In a mortar, crush the cloves and coriander seeds until finely ground. Add the ground spices to the minced fish mixture.
4. Add the softened butter to the minced fish mixture and mix well to combine.
5. In a small saucepan, heat the cream or milk over low heat until it simmers. Add the slice of bread and let it soak in the cream or milk for a few minutes.
6. In a separate bowl, beat the egg yolks. Gradually add the soaked bread and cream or milk mixture to the beaten egg yolks, stirring constantly until well combined. Set aside to cool.
7. In another mortar, pound the raw egg yolks and the cooled bread and cream mixture until smooth and creamy.
8. Prepare a salmon ragout by peeling and slicing the mushrooms. Rub the salmon slices with melted butter and grill them until cooked. Cut the grilled salmon into small slices.
9. In a saucepan, melt butter over medium heat. Add the flour and cook until it turns brown, stirring constantly.
10. Add the sliced mushrooms to the saucepan and cook for a few minutes, stirring occasionally.
11. Pour in the fish broth and add salt, pepper, and the fresh herb bunch. Let the ragout simmer for a while.
12. Remove the fat from the ragout and set it aside to cool.
13. Grease a saucepan with fresh butter and line the bottom and sides with a buttered sheet of parchment paper.
14. Spread a layer of the prepared fish and cream mixture in the lined saucepan, about an inch thick or more. Use a beaten egg to brush the surface of the mixture to make it smoother.
15. Place the salmon ragout in the bottom of the saucepan and cover it with the remaining fish and cream mixture.
16. Brush the top of the pupton with beaten egg and bake it in the preheated oven for about 45-60 minutes, or until cooked through and golden brown.
17. Once baked, carefully turn the pupton upside down onto a serving dish, remove the parchment paper, and make a small hole in the top.
18. Pour in some crayfish sauce through the hole and serve the pupton hot as a main course.
