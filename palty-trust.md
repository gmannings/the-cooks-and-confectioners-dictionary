# Palty Trust

## Description
Palty Trust is a traditional 18th-century bread-like dish made with flour, butter, milk, brandy, and ale-yeast. It is a rich and flavorful treat that can be enjoyed on its own or served with butter and jam.

## Options and commentary
- You can use all-purpose flour as a modern alternative to the "dry'd flour" mentioned in the original recipe.
- Instead of rubbing the butter into the flour, you can use a food processor or a pastry cutter to incorporate the butter.
- If you don't have brandy, you can substitute it with rum or whiskey.
- Ale-yeast can be replaced with active dry yeast or instant yeast.

## Ingredients:
- 250 grams all-purpose flour
- 225 grams unsalted butter, cold and cubed
- 120 milliliters milk
- 60 milliliters brandy
- 1 1/2 tablespoons ale-yeast (or active dry yeast or instant yeast)

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F).
2. In a large mixing bowl, combine the flour and cold butter. Use your fingertips or a pastry cutter to rub the butter into the flour until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs.
3. In a separate bowl, mix together the milk, brandy, and ale-yeast.
4. Pour the milk mixture into the flour mixture and stir until well combined. If the dough seems too dry, add more milk, a little at a time, until it reaches a soft and slightly sticky consistency.
5. Transfer the dough onto a lightly floured surface and gently knead it with a rolling pin for a few minutes. The goal is to make the dough light and well-mixed, but avoid over-kneading.
6. Shape the dough into a round or oval loaf and place it on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper.
7. Bake in the preheated oven for approximately 40-45 minutes, or until the Palty Trust is golden brown and sounds hollow when tapped on the bottom.
8. Remove from the oven and let it cool on a wire rack before slicing and serving.

## Cooking time
Approximately 40-45 minutes.
