## Description
Pupton of Duails is a dish made with a mixture of minced veal, bacon, beef, ham, mushrooms, herbs, and spices, encased in a farce (a forcemeat mixture) and baked. It is then served with a sauce.

## Options and commentary
- Instead of veal, you can use ground pork or chicken.
- Instead of fuet, you can use lard or butter.
- Instead of the lean of ham, you can use cooked ham or prosciutto.
- Instead of coriander seeds, you can use ground coriander.
- Instead of a French roll, you can use bread crumbs.
- Instead of cream, you can use milk or a non-dairy milk substitute.
- Instead of raw eggs, you can use egg replacer or omit them for a vegetarian version.
- Instead of bacon, you can use pancetta or omit it for a vegetarian version.
- Instead of a baking cover or oven, you can use a covered baking dish or a Dutch oven.

## Ingredients:
- 500g ground veal (or pork or chicken)
- 100g bacon, finely chopped
- 100g beef, finely chopped
- 100g ham, finely chopped
- 100g mushrooms, finely chopped
- 2 tablespoons chopped chives
- 2 tablespoons chopped parsley
- Salt and pepper to taste
- 1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg
- 1/4 teaspoon ground cloves
- 2 tablespoons chopped fresh herbs (such as thyme, rosemary, or sage)
- 1 teaspoon ground coriander
- 1 French roll, soaked in 1/4 cup cream (or bread crumbs soaked in milk)
- 4-5 raw eggs, yolks only (optional)
- 6-8 slices of bacon (or pancetta)
- Cullis or sauce for serving

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F).
2. In a large bowl, combine the ground veal, bacon, beef, ham, mushrooms, chives, parsley, salt, pepper, nutmeg, cloves, fresh herbs, and ground coriander. Mix well.
3. In a separate bowl, combine the soaked French roll (or bread crumbs) and the egg yolks (if using). Mix until well combined.
4. Add the bread mixture to the meat mixture and mix until everything is evenly combined.
5. Grease a large saucepan or baking dish with butter or oil. Line the bottom and sides of the pan with bacon slices, overlapping them slightly.
6. Spread the meat mixture evenly over the bacon-lined pan, pressing it down firmly.
7. Dip your hand in beaten egg and smooth the meat mixture to create an even layer.
8. Prepare a ragout according to the instructions for a braised capon (see recipe C, Number 30).
9. Place the ragout in the middle of the meat mixture, making sure to cover it completely with the meat mixture.
10. Brush the top of the meat mixture with beaten egg and lay slices of bacon over it.
11. Cover the saucepan or baking dish with a lid or foil, or place it in a baking cover or oven.
12. Bake for about 1 hour, or until the pupton is cooked through and the bacon is crispy.
13. Remove the pupton from the oven and carefully invert it onto a serving dish. Make a hole in the top of the pupton, about the size of a coin.
14. Pour the cullis or sauce into the hole and serve the pupton hot as a first course.
