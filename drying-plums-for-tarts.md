# Drying Plums for Tarts

## Description
This recipe is for drying plums to be used in tarts. Drying the plums helps to concentrate their flavor and extend their shelf life.

## Ingredients:
- Plums

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to a low temperature, around 100Â°C.
2. Wash the plums and pat them dry with a clean towel.
3. Place a wire rack or lattice on a baking sheet.
4. Arrange the plums on the wire rack or lattice, making sure they are not touching each other.
5. Place the baking sheet with the plums in the preheated oven.
6. Leave the plums in the oven after the bread has been baked and removed. This will take advantage of the residual heat in the oven.
7. After about 1 hour, remove the plums from the oven and carefully turn them over.
8. Place the plums back in the oven and continue drying for another hour or until they are dry and slightly shriveled.
9. Once the plums are dry, remove them from the oven and let them cool completely.
10. Transfer the dried plums to paper bags with small holes for ventilation.
11. Hang the paper bags in a warm place, such as a pantry or a dry cellar, to allow further drying and storage.

## Cooking time
Approximately 2-3 hours, depending on the size and moisture content of the plums.
