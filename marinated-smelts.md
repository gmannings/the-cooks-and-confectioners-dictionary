## Description
Marinated smelts are small fish that have been fried and then marinated in a flavorful mixture of oil, spices, and wine. This dish is a delicious appetizer or can be served as part of a seafood platter.

## Ingredients:
- 1 quart (946 ml) vegetable oil

6. Transfer the fried bay leaves to an earthenware pan.
7. Pour the red wine into the earthenware pan, covering the fried bay leaves.
8. Layer some of the fried bay leaves on the bottom of the pan, then place the fried smelts on top.
9. Slice the ginger, mace, and nutmeg, and add them to the pan.
10. Pour the white wine over the smelts and spices.
