# Veal, Mutton, and Chicken Broth with Raisins

## Description
This recipe is for a rich and flavorful broth made from a combination of veal, mutton, and chicken, along with the addition of raisins. The broth is boiled and strained to create a clear and flavorful liquid that can be used as a base for soups, stews, or other dishes.

## Ingredients:
- 1 knuckle of veal
- 1 knuckle of mutton
- 1 young chicken
- Raisins of the Sun (approximately 1/4 of the weight of the meat)
- 2-3 blades of mace
- 1 stick of cinnamon, broken into small pieces
- Double-refined sugar, to taste

## Instructions:
1. In a large pot, place the knuckle of veal, knuckle of mutton, and the young chicken.
2. Add enough water to cover the meat.
3. Bring the pot to a boil and then reduce the heat to a simmer.
4. Allow the meat to simmer for several hours, until it is very tender and falling off the bone.
5. Remove the meat from the pot and set it aside to cool.
6. Once the meat is cool enough to handle, remove any excess fat from the top and any sediment from the bottom of the broth.
7. Strain the broth through a fine-mesh sieve or cheesecloth to remove any solids.
8. Return the strained broth to the pot and place it back on the stove.
9. Add the raisins, blades of mace, broken cinnamon stick, and double-refined sugar to the pot.
10. Bring the broth back to a boil and then reduce the heat to a simmer.
11. Allow the broth to simmer for another hour or so, to allow the flavors to meld together.
12. Taste the broth and adjust the seasoning if necessary, adding more sugar if desired.
13. Once the broth has simmered and the flavors have developed, strain it once again to remove any remaining solids.
14. The broth is now ready to be used in your desired recipe.
