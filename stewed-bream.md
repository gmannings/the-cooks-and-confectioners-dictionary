# Stewed Bream

## Description
Stewed Bream is a classic dish where the fish is cooked in a flavorful broth and served with a rich sauce. The bream is simmered in a mixture of claret wine, ginger, prunes, salt, vinegar, anchovies, horseradish, and sweet herbs. The dish is then finished with a butter sauce and garnished with oranges, lemons, and barberries.

## Ingredients:
- 1 bream (approximately 500g)
- 250ml claret wine
- 2-3 slices of ginger
- 175g prunes
- Salt, to taste
- 2 tablespoons vinegar
- 2 anchovies
- 1 tablespoon grated horseradish
- Assorted sweet herbs (such as parsley, thyme, and bay leaves)
- 50g butter
- Oranges, for garnish
- Lemons, for garnish
- Barberries, for garnish

## Instructions:
1. Scale and wash the bream thoroughly. 
2. Preserve the blood of the bream to use in the stew.
3. In a large pot, combine the claret wine, ginger slices, prunes, salt, vinegar, anchovies, grated horseradish, and sweet herbs.
4. Add enough water to the pot to just cover the fish and other ingredients.
5. Place the pot over medium heat and bring the liquid to a simmer.
6. Carefully add the bream to the pot and let it cook gently in the simmering liquid for about 15-20 minutes, or until the fish is cooked through and flakes easily.
7. While the fish is cooking, prepare the butter sauce. In a small saucepan, melt the butter over low heat.
8. Once the butter has melted, add a little of the bream liquor to the saucepan and whisk them together until well combined.
9. Remove the bream from the pot and transfer it to a serving dish.
10. Pour the butter sauce over the fish.
11. Garnish the dish with slices of oranges, lemons, and barberries.
12. Serve the stewed bream hot.
