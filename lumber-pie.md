# Lumber Pie

## Description
Lumber Pie is a traditional meat pie made with leftover cold meat, suet, herbs, spices, and dried fruits. It is a hearty and flavorful dish that can be served as a main course.

## Options and commentary
- You can use any leftover cold meat, except beef and pork, for this recipe. Chicken, turkey, or lamb would work well.
- Instead of suet, you can use butter or vegetable shortening for a lighter version of the pie.
- The traditional sweet herbs used in this recipe include parsley, thyme, and marjoram. You can also add other herbs like sage or rosemary for additional flavor.
- Cloves, mace, and nutmeg are the traditional spices used in this recipe. You can adjust the amounts according to your taste preferences.
- The dried fruits used in this recipe are raisins, currants, and dates. You can also add other dried fruits like apricots or prunes.
- The sauce served with the pie is made with sugar, Canary wine (a type of sweet white wine), butter, egg yolks, verjuice (a sour juice made from unripe grapes), and mace. If you can't find verjuice, you can substitute it with lemon juice or white wine vinegar.
