## Ingredients:
- 2 rabbits (or chicken/turkey)
- 200g lean ham
- 200g bacon
- 500g veal, sliced
- 2 onions, sliced
- 2 parsnips, sliced
- 2 carrots, sliced
- Assorted fresh herbs (such as parsley, thyme, and rosemary)
- Salt and pepper to taste
- Spices (such as cloves, nutmeg, or allspice)

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F).

2. Divide the rabbits into quarters and season them with salt and pepper.

3. Line the bottom of a large baking dish with bacon slices.
