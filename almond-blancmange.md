# Almond Blancmange

## Description
Almond Blancmange is a creamy and delicate dessert made with calves' feet, chicken, sugar, cinnamon, lemon peel, and sweet almonds. It is a refreshing and light dessert that is perfect for serving cold.

## Options and commentary
- You can use gelatin instead of calves' feet for a quicker and easier preparation.
- If you prefer a stronger flavor, you can add a splash of almond extract.
- You can garnish the blancmange with fresh berries or toasted almonds for added texture and flavor.

## Ingredients:
- 2 calves' feet (or 2 packets of gelatin)
- 1 chicken (not very fat)
- Sugar, to taste
- 1 cinnamon stick
- Peel of 1 lemon
- 200g sweet almonds, blanched and finely ground
- 500ml milk
- Orange flower water, to taste
- Lemon slices, for garnish

## Instructions:
1. In a large pot, combine the calves' feet (or gelatin) and chicken. Add enough water to cover the ingredients.
2. Bring the pot to a boil over medium heat. Skim off any foam that rises to the surface.
3. Reduce the heat to low and simmer for 2-3 hours, or until the meat is tender and falling off the bones.
4. Remove the calves' feet (or gelatin) and chicken from the pot and strain the broth. Discard any solids.
5. Return the broth to the pot and add sugar, cinnamon stick, and lemon peel. Stir well to dissolve the sugar.
6. In a separate bowl, combine the ground almonds and milk. Mix until well combined and there are no lumps.
7. Slowly pour the almond mixture into the pot with the broth, stirring constantly.
8. Continue to cook over low heat, stirring occasionally, until the mixture thickens and coats the back of a spoon. This will take about 30-40 minutes.
9. Remove the pot from the heat and let the mixture cool slightly.
10. Strain the mixture through a fine-mesh sieve into a clean bowl. This will remove any lumps or solids.
11. Rinse the sieve well and strain the mixture again to ensure a smooth and creamy texture.
12. Add a few drops of orange flower water to the mixture and stir well.
13. Pour the blancmange into a dish or individual serving bowls.
14. Place the dish or bowls in the refrigerator and let the blancmange set for at least 4 hours, or until firm.
15. Once the blancmange is set, garnish with lemon slices.
16. Serve the almond blancmange cold.
