## Description
Frically Rabbets is a dish made with parboiled rabbit pieces that are floured and fried in butter. It is served with a sauce made from egg yolks, broth, white wine, parsley, sugar, and nutmeg. Optional additions to the dish include artichoke bottoms and roasted sliced potatoes. The dish is garnished with boiled parsley, barberries, and lemon.

## Options and commentary
- Instead of rabbit, you can use chicken or pork as a substitute.
- If you don't have artichoke bottoms, you can omit them or use canned artichoke hearts.
- The dish can be served with rice, mashed potatoes, or crusty bread.

## Ingredients:
- 1 rabbit (or chicken or pork)
- Flour, for coating
- 50g butter
- 6 egg yolks
- 500ml strong broth (chicken or vegetable)
- 250ml white wine
- A handful of parsley, boiled and chopped
- 1 teaspoon sugar
- 1 nutmeg, grated
- Optional: artichoke bottoms or canned artichoke hearts
- Optional: sliced roasted potatoes
- Sippets (small pieces of toasted bread)
- Boiled parsley, for garnish
- Barberries, for garnish
- Lemon slices, for garnish

## Instructions:
1. Parboil the rabbit (or chicken or pork) until cooked through. This can be done by simmering the meat in a pot of water for about 30 minutes. Remove the meat from the pot and let it cool slightly.
2. Cut the parboiled meat into halves or quarters, depending on the size of the pieces.
3. Coat the meat pieces with flour, shaking off any excess.
4. In a large frying pan, melt the butter over medium heat.
5. Fry the floured meat pieces in the melted butter until golden brown on all sides. Remove the meat from the pan and set aside.
6. In a separate bowl, whisk together the egg yolks, strong broth, and white wine until well combined.
7. Add the chopped parsley, sugar, and grated nutmeg to the egg yolk mixture. Stir to combine.
8. If using, add the artichoke bottoms or canned artichoke hearts and sliced roasted potatoes to the frying pan. Cook for a few minutes until heated through.
9. Return the fried meat pieces to the pan with the artichoke bottoms and roasted potatoes.
10. Pour the egg yolk mixture over the meat and vegetables in the pan.
11. Shake the pan gently over the heat to distribute the sauce evenly. Continue cooking until the sauce thickens and the meat is heated through.
12. Meanwhile, prepare sippets by toasting small pieces of bread until crisp.
13. To serve, place the frically rabbets on a serving dish lined with sippets.
14. Pour the sauce over the meat and garnish with boiled parsley, barberries, and lemon slices.
