# Candied Cherries

## Description
Candied cherries are a sweet treat made by coating cherries in a sugar syrup and drying them. They make a delicious addition to desserts, baked goods, or can be enjoyed on their own.

## Ingredients:
- 500g cherries (not fully ripe)
- 500g granulated sugar

## Instructions:
1. Wash the cherries and remove the pits.
2. In a medium-sized saucepan, combine the sugar with enough water to make a thick syrup. Heat the mixture over medium heat, stirring until the sugar has dissolved completely.
3. Once the syrup reaches a candy height (approximately 150°C), remove it from the heat.
4. Gently pour the hot syrup over the cherries, ensuring they are fully coated. Stir the cherries gently to ensure even coverage.
5. Allow the cherries to sit in the syrup until it is almost cold.
6. Using a slotted spoon, remove the cherries from the syrup and place them on a wire rack or parchment paper to dry.
7. Leave the cherries to dry completely at room temperature or place them in a low-temperature oven (around 50°C) for a few hours until they are no longer sticky.
8. Once dry, store the candied cherries in an airtight container.

## Cooking time
Approximately 1-2 hours, depending on the drying method.
