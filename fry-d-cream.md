# Fry'd Cream

## Description
Fry'd Cream is a traditional 18th-century dessert made with cream, milk, eggs, and flour. The mixture is flavored with cinnamon and sugar, then fried until golden and crispy. It is typically served hot with a sprinkle of sugar on top.

## Options and commentary
- You can add a touch of vanilla extract or grated nutmeg for additional flavor.
- Instead of frying, you can also bake the cream squares in the oven at 180Â°C for about 15-20 minutes until golden brown.

## Ingredients:
- 500 ml cream
- 250 ml milk
- 1 cinnamon stick
- 50 g sugar
- 8 egg yolks
- 6 egg whites
- 60 ml cream
- 50 g all-purpose flour
- Pinch of salt
- 1 tablespoon finely minced citron
- Mazareen (pastry dough)
- Hog's lard (or vegetable oil) for frying
- Sugar for serving

## Instructions:
1. In a saucepan, combine the cream, milk, cinnamon stick, and sugar. Place it over medium heat and let it simmer for 15 minutes.
2. In another saucepan, beat the egg yolks and egg whites together using a wooden spoon.
3. Add 60 ml of cream and the flour to the beaten eggs. Mix well until smooth.
4. Remove the cinnamon stick from the simmering cream mixture and pour the hot cream into the egg mixture. Stir well.
5. Place the saucepan with the cream and egg mixture back on the heat. Cook over medium heat, stirring constantly, for 15 minutes or until the mixture thickens to a custard-like consistency.
6. Add a pinch of salt and the minced citron to the mixture. Stir well.
7. Prepare a Mazareen (pastry dough) by rolling it out to the thickness of your thumb.
8. Cut the dough into squares or diamonds, about three inches long.
9. Dust the cut dough with flour.
10. Heat the hog's lard (or vegetable oil) in a frying pan over medium heat.
11. Fry the cream squares in the hot lard until golden and crispy on both sides. This should take about 2-3 minutes per side.
12. Remove the fried cream squares from the pan and drain them on a paper towel to remove excess oil.
13. Serve the Fry'd Cream hot, sprinkled with a little sugar on top.
