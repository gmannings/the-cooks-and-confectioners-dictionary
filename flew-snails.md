# Flew Snails

## Description
Flew Snails is a traditional 18th-century dish made with snails cooked in a flavorful sauce. The snails are stewed with a mixture of claret, wine vinegar, spices, breadcrumbs, herbs, capers, and minced hard-boiled eggs. The dish is then garnished with barberries and slices of lemon.

## Options and commentary
- If you can't find fresh snails, you can use canned or frozen snails as a substitute.
- Barberries may be difficult to find, so you can use cranberries or currants as a substitute.
- This dish can be served as an appetizer or as a main course with crusty bread or rice.

## Ingredients:
- 500g snails (fresh, canned, or frozen)
- 250ml claret (red wine)
- 250ml wine vinegar
- Salt, to taste
- Pepper, to taste
- 1/2 teaspoon ground mace
- 50g breadcrumbs
- 1 tablespoon fresh thyme, chopped
- 2 tablespoons capers
- 2 hard-boiled eggs, yolks minced
- 50g butter
- 1 clove garlic
- Barberries, cranberries, or currants, for garnish
- Lemon slices, for garnish

## Instructions:
1. If using fresh snails, clean and prepare them according to the instructions provided with the snails. If using canned or frozen snails, skip this step.
2. In a large pot or pipkin, combine the claret, wine vinegar, salt, pepper, ground mace, breadcrumbs, thyme, capers, and minced hard-boiled egg yolks.
3. Add the snails to the pot and stir to coat them with the sauce mixture.
4. Place the pot over medium heat and bring the mixture to a simmer. Reduce the heat to low and cover the pot.
5. Allow the snails to stew in the sauce for about 1 hour, or until they are tender.
6. In a separate small saucepan, melt the butter over low heat.
7. Once the snails are cooked, pour the melted butter over them and stir well to combine.
8. Warm a serving dish and rub it with the clove of garlic to infuse it with flavor.
9. Arrange sippets (small pieces of toasted bread) in the warmed dish.
10. Spoon the snails and sauce over the sippets.
11. Garnish the dish with barberries (or cranberries/currants) and slices of lemon.
