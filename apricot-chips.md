# Apricot Chips

## Description
Apricot chips are a sweet and tangy treat made from sliced apricots and sugar. The apricots are cooked in a sugar syrup until they are scalding hot, then left to soak overnight. Afterward, they are laid out on plates and dried in the sun.

## Ingredients:
- 500g apricots
- 500g double refined sugar

## Instructions:
1. Wash the apricots and slice them lengthwise, leaving the skin on.
2. In a large pot, combine the sugar with enough water to cover it. Bring to a boil and cook until the sugar has dissolved completely, creating a thin candy syrup.
3. Carefully place the sliced apricots into the syrup and let them cook over medium heat until they become scalding hot. Stir gently to ensure all the apricots are coated in the syrup.
4. Remove the pot from the heat and let the apricots soak in the syrup overnight.
5. The next day, remove the apricots from the syrup and place them on thin plates or baking sheets, making sure they are not touching each other.
6. Set the plates or baking sheets in a sunny spot, such as a windowsill or outdoor area, to dry. This process may take several days, depending on the weather and humidity.
7. Once the apricots are completely dry and have a chewy texture, they are ready to be enjoyed.

## Cooking time
Drying time will vary depending on the weather and humidity, but it can take several days.
