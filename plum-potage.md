# Plum Potage

## Description
Plum Potage is a rich and flavorful soup made with a combination of meats, bread, spices, dried fruits, and wine. It was a popular dish in the 18th century and is still enjoyed today as a hearty and comforting soup.

## Options and commentary
- You can use a combination of beef, neck beef, and neck of mutton to make the broth. Alternatively, you can use beef or vegetable broth as a base.
- Instead of steeping the grated bread in the broth, you can use breadcrumbs or flour as a thickening agent.
- The spices used in the original recipe are cloves, nutmeg, mace, and cinnamon. You can adjust the quantities according to your taste preferences.
- Currants, raisins, and dates are added to the soup for sweetness and texture. You can use other dried fruits like prunes or apricots as well.
- The original recipe calls for Canary wine and red Port wine. You can substitute these with white wine or sherry for a similar flavor profile.
- The addition of grape verjuice and orange juice at the end adds a tangy and refreshing twist to the soup. You can omit these if you prefer a sweeter flavor.

## Ingredients:
- 1 leg or shin of beef
- Neck beef
- Neck of mutton
- 1 quart (946 ml) beef or vegetable broth
- 1/4 loaf of bread, grated or 1/2 cup breadcrumbs
- 6 cloves
- 2 nutmegs, grated
- 6 blades of mace
- 1 cinnamon stick, broken into small pieces
- 2-3 pounds (900-1350 g) currants
- 2 pounds (900 g) raisins
- 1/2 pound (225 g) dates, pitted and sliced
- Salt to taste
- 1 quart (946 ml) white wine or sherry
- 1 quart (946 ml) red Port wine
- Grape verjuice (optional)
- Juice of 1 orange (optional)

## Instructions:
1. In a large pot, combine the leg or shin of beef, neck beef, and neck of mutton. Cover with water and bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer for several hours until the meat is tender and the flavors have infused into the broth.
2. Remove the meat from the pot and strain the broth to remove any solids. Allow the broth to cool and skim off any fat that rises to the surface.
3. In a separate bowl, combine the grated bread or breadcrumbs with 3 quarts (2.8 liters) of the strained broth. Let the bread steep in the broth for about an hour.
4. After the bread has soaked, transfer the mixture back to the pot and place it over medium heat.
5. Add the cloves, grated nutmeg, blades of mace, and broken cinnamon stick to the pot. Stir well to combine.
6. Add the currants, raisins, and sliced dates to the pot. Season with salt to taste.
7. Bring the potage to a gentle boil and let it simmer for about 30 minutes, or until the dried fruits have plumped up and the flavors have melded together.
8. Pour in the white wine or sherry and the red Port wine. Continue to simmer for another 10-15 minutes.
9. If desired, add a splash of grape verjuice and the juice of 1 orange to the potage just before serving. Stir well to incorporate.
10. Serve the Plum Potage hot, garnished with a sprinkle of grated nutmeg or a cinnamon stick, if desired.

## Cooking time
Approximately 4-5 hours (including simmering time for the broth and cooking time for the potage).
