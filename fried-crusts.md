# Fried Crusts

## Description
Fried Crusts are a crispy and flavorful dish made by frying pieces of bread in lard and seasoning them with a combination of flour, white wine, salt, pepper, nutmeg, sweet herbs, capers, and lemon juice.

## Ingredients:
- Lard, for frying
- 4 slices of bread
- 2 tablespoons flour
- 2 tablespoons white wine
- Salt, to taste
- Pepper, to taste
- Nutmeg, a pinch
- A faggot of sweet herbs (a bundle of fresh herbs such as parsley, thyme, and bay leaves)
- 1 tablespoon capers
- Juice of 1 lemon

## Instructions:
1. Heat lard in a frying pan over medium heat until hot.
2. Cut the bread slices into desired shapes, such as triangles or squares.
3. In a shallow dish, mix together the flour, white wine, salt, pepper, and nutmeg to form a thick batter.
4. Dip each bread piece into the batter, coating it evenly on all sides.
5. Carefully place the coated bread pieces into the hot lard and fry until golden brown and crispy, turning them occasionally to ensure even cooking.
6. Once fried, remove the crusts from the lard and drain them on a paper towel to remove excess oil.
7. In a separate small saucepan, combine the faggot of sweet herbs, capers, and lemon juice. Heat gently over low heat for a few minutes to infuse the flavors.
8. Remove the faggot of sweet herbs from the saucepan and discard.
9. Drizzle the infused lemon juice mixture over the fried crusts.
10. Serve the fried crusts hot as an appetizer or snack.
