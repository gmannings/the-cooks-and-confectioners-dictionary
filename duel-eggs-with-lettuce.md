# Duel Eggs with Lettuce

## Description
Duel Eggs with Lettuce is a dish made with cabbage lettuce and poached eggs, served with a flavorful sauce. The lettuce is sliced and cooked with butter, herbs, and seasonings, then topped with poached eggs and served on plates.

## Ingredients:
- 1 head of cabbage lettuce
- 2 tablespoons butter
- Salt and pepper to taste
- A bunch of fresh herbs (such as parsley, thyme, or chives)
- 4 eggs
- Fish stock or vegetable stock for the sauce

## Instructions:
1. Bring a pot of water to a boil and blanch the cabbage lettuce for a few minutes to soften it. Drain and squeeze out any excess water. Slice the lettuce into thin strips.
2. In a saucepan, melt the butter over medium heat. Add the sliced lettuce and season with salt, pepper, and the fresh herbs. Cook the lettuce mixture over low heat for about 30 minutes, stirring occasionally.
3. Skim off any excess fat from the lettuce mixture. Add the fish stock or vegetable stock to the saucepan and simmer for a few minutes to create a flavorful sauce.
4. In a separate pan, melt some butter and poach the eggs until the whites are set but the yolks are still runny.
5. To serve, spoon the cooked lettuce onto plates and place a poached egg on top of each portion.
6. Drizzle the sauce over the eggs and lettuce.
7. Serve immediately.

## Cooking time
Approximately 40 minutes.
