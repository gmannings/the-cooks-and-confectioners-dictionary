# Gammon Pie

## Description
Gammon Pie is a traditional British dish made with a gammon (cured ham) joint that is slow-cooked and then baked in a pastry crust. The gammon is flavored with bacon, beef, spices, onions, and herbs, creating a rich and savory filling. This pie is typically served cold and makes for a delicious picnic or party dish.

## Ingredients:
- 1 gammon joint (approximately 1 kg)
- 200g bacon, thinly sliced
- 200g beef steak, thinly sliced
- 1 onion, sliced
- 1 bay leaf
- 1 teaspoon mixed spices (such as cloves, nutmeg, and allspice)
- Fresh herbs (such as thyme, rosemary, or parsley)
- Salt and pepper to taste
- Pastry for the pie crust
- Bread crumbs for sprinkling

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 150°C.
2. Remove the skin from the gammon joint and trim off any excess fat. Cut off the hock and bone the gammon in the middle.
3. Layer the bottom of a large pot with bacon slices, followed by beef slices.
4. Place the gammon joint on top of the bacon and beef layers.
5. Sprinkle the sliced onion, bay leaf, mixed spices, and fresh herbs over the gammon.
6. Cover the pot tightly with a lid and place it in the preheated oven.
7. Stew the gammon for approximately 14-15 hours, ensuring the heat is both over and under the pot. The stewing should be done gently.
8. Once cooked, allow the gammon to cool in the pot.
9. Preheat the oven to 180°C.
10. Roll out the pastry and line a baking dish, creating a border around the edges.
11. Transfer the gammon from the pot to the pastry-lined dish.
12. Pour off any excess fat from the pot and reserve the gammon's own gravy.
13. Fill the intervals between the gammon with the beef slices and some fat.
14. Complete the filling by adding more bacon slices and any remaining onion and herbs.
15. Cover the pie with a pastry lid, sealing the edges with water or beaten egg.
16. Use a hot fire-shovel or a blowtorch to give the pie a golden color.
17. Sprinkle chopped parsley and bread crumbs over the top of the pie.
18. Bake the pie in the preheated oven for approximately 45 minutes or until the pastry is golden and crisp.
19. Once baked, remove the pie from the oven and allow it to cool before serving.
20. Serve the Gammon Pie cold, either as a main dish or as part of a buffet or picnic spread.
