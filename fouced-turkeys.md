# Fouced Turkeys

## Description
Fouced Turkeys is a dish where turkey meat is boned, tied up, and then cooked in a vinegar-based liquid. The turkeys are then pickled and served similar to sturgeon, with a tangy vinegar sauce and garnished with fennel.

## Options and commentary
- Instead of turkeys, you can use chicken or any other poultry of your choice.
- If you prefer a milder flavor, you can reduce the amount of vinegar used in the recipe.
- Fennel can be substituted with other herbs or omitted if desired.

## Ingredients:
- 2 turkeys (or chicken)
- 2 liters of wine vinegar
- 1 liter of water
- Salt
- Elder-vinegar (for serving)
- Fennel (for garnish)

## Instructions:
1. Bone the turkeys by carefully removing the bones while keeping the flesh intact. You can find tutorials online on how to bone a turkey if you are unfamiliar with the process.
2. Tie up the turkey flesh tightly using kitchen twine, similar to how sturgeon is prepared.
3. In a large pan, combine the wine vinegar and water. Bring it to a boil.
4. Season the liquid with salt to taste.
5. Carefully place the tied-up turkeys into the boiling liquid. Make sure they are fully submerged.
6. Boil the turkeys until they are tender. This may take around 1-2 hours, depending on the size of the turkeys.
7. If you find that the liquid is not sharp enough, you can add more vinegar and continue boiling for a little longer.
8. Once the turkeys are cooked, remove them from the liquid and let them cool.
9. Transfer the turkeys to an earthenware pan and cover them with the cooking liquid.
10. Let the turkeys marinate in the liquid for three to four weeks in the refrigerator.
11. When you are ready to serve the fouced turkeys, remove them from the liquid and slice them into desired portions.
12. Serve the fouced turkeys with elder-vinegar as a tangy sauce and garnish with fennel.

## Cooking time
Approximately 1-2 hours for boiling the turkeys, plus 3-4 weeks for marinating.
