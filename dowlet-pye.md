# Dowlet Pye

## Description
Dowlet Pye is a traditional 18th-century dish made with minced veal, beef suet, and sweet herbs, baked in a pie crust. The filling is seasoned with nutmeg and cinnamon, and eggs are added to bind the mixture. The pie is then garnished with dates and dried plums, and served with a sauce made from white wine, sugar, and butter.

## Ingredients:
- 1 leg of veal, roasted or parboiled
- 200g beef suet
- 2 tablespoons fresh sweet herbs (such as parsley, thyme, and sage), finely chopped
- 1/2 teaspoon nutmeg
- 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon
- 4 eggs
- 8 dates
- 100g dried plums
- 200ml white wine
- 2 tablespoons sugar
- 2 tablespoons butter
- Pie crust (store-bought or homemade)

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F).
2. Finely mince the roasted or parboiled leg of veal and place it in a mixing bowl.
3. Add the beef suet, sweet herbs, nutmeg, and cinnamon to the bowl with the minced veal. Mix well to combine all the ingredients.
4. In a separate bowl, beat the eggs until well blended.
5. Add the beaten eggs to the veal mixture and mix until everything is evenly coated.
6. Take a small portion of the veal mixture and shape it into an egg shape. Repeat with the remaining mixture to make several veal "eggs."
7. Insert a date into the center of each veal "egg" and set them aside.
8. Roll out the pie crust and line a pie dish with it.
9. Place the veal "eggs" in the pie dish, arranging them evenly.
10. Scatter the dried plums over the veal "eggs" in the pie dish.
11. Cover the pie dish with another layer of rolled-out pie crust, sealing the edges.
12. Place the pie in the preheated oven and bake for 45-50 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown.
13. While the pie is baking, prepare the sauce. In a small saucepan, combine the white wine, sugar, and butter. Heat over medium heat until the butter is melted and the sugar is dissolved. Remove from heat.
14. Once the pie is cooked, remove it from the oven and carefully pour the prepared sauce over the top.
15. Allow the pie to cool for a few minutes before serving.
