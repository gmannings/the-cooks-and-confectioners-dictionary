# Baked Pudding with Carrots and Beef Suet

## Description
This recipe is for a baked pudding made with carrots, beef suet, cream, bread, eggs, and various flavorings. The pudding has a soft and moist texture with a hint of sweetness from the carrots and sugar. It can be served as a dessert or a side dish.

## Options and commentary
- Instead of beef suet, you can use vegetable shortening or butter as a modern alternative.
- You can add spices like cinnamon or nutmeg for additional flavor.
- The pudding can be served warm or cold, depending on your preference.

## Ingredients:
- 240 ml cream
- 2 penny loaves (grated) or 200 g bread crumbs
- 115 g beef suet (or vegetable shortening/butter)
- 200 g boiled red carrots, mashed
- 1 tsp rose water
- 1 tbsp Canary wine (or any sweet white wine)
- 4 egg yolks
- 2 egg whites
- 115 g melted butter
- 1 tbsp all-purpose flour
- Sugar, to taste
- Butter, for greasing the dish
- Lime juice, for sauce

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 180Â°C.
2. In a mixing bowl, combine the cream, grated bread, beef suet, mashed carrots, rose water, Canary wine, egg yolks, melted butter, flour, and sugar. Stir well until all the ingredients are thoroughly combined.
3. In a separate bowl, beat the egg whites until stiff peaks form.
4. Gently fold the beaten egg whites into the pudding mixture.
5. Grease a baking dish with butter and pour the pudding mixture into it.
6. Place the dish in the preheated oven and bake for about 45-50 minutes, or until the pudding is set and golden brown on top.
7. Once baked, remove the dish from the oven and carefully invert it onto a serving dish, so the bottom becomes the top.
8. In a small saucepan, melt some butter and add sugar and lime juice to taste. Heat the sauce until the sugar has dissolved.
9. Pour the butter, sugar, and lime juice sauce over the baked pudding.
10. Serve the pudding warm or cold, as desired.
