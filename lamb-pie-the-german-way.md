# Lamb Pie the German Way

## Description
This recipe is for a traditional lamb pie, prepared in the German style. The lamb is cut into pieces and then larded with small strips of bacon. It is seasoned with a mixture of salt, pepper, cloves, nutmeg, and a bay leaf. The lamb is then combined with pounded bacon, chives, and sweet herbs, and baked in a pie. After baking, the pie is opened, the fat is skimmed off, and a ragout of oysters is added. The pie is served hot as a first course.

## Options and commentary
- You can use boneless lamb shoulder or leg for this recipe.
- If you don't have access to larding bacon, you can use regular bacon and cut it into small strips.
