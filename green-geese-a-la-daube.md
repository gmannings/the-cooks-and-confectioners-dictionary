# Green Geese a la Daube

## Description
Green Geese a la Daube is a traditional 18th-century dish made with geese that are seasoned, wrapped in a napkin, and boiled in a mixture of white wine and broth. The geese are then served cold and garnished with parsley and lemon slices. This dish can also be made with other types of poultry such as capons, partridges, or turkeys. Optionally, slices of veal and bacon can be added during the boiling process to keep the meat white.

## Ingredients:
- 2 geese (or other poultry)
- Bacon, cut into lardons (thin strips)
- Salt
- Pepper
- Cloves
- Nutmeg
- Chives
- 1 bay leaf
- Lemon peel
- White wine
- Broth (chicken or vegetable)
- Parsley, for garnish
- Lemon slices, for garnish
- Veal slices (optional)
- Bacon slices (optional)

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F).

2. Prepare the geese by larding them with the bacon lardons. Insert the lardons into the meat, evenly spaced apart.

3. Season the geese with salt, pepper, cloves, nutmeg, chives, the bay leaf, and lemon peel. Rub the seasonings all over the geese, ensuring they are well coated.

4. Wrap each goose tightly in a clean napkin, securing it with kitchen twine.

5. In a large pot, combine white wine and broth in equal parts, enough to cover the geese. Bring the liquid to a boil.

6. Carefully place the wrapped geese into the boiling liquid. If using, add slices of veal and bacon to the pot as well.

7. Reduce the heat to a simmer and cook the geese for approximately 2 hours, or until they are fully cooked and tender. Skim off any impurities that rise to the surface.

8. Once the geese are cooked, remove them from the pot and allow them to cool in the broth. This will help retain their moisture and flavor.

9. Once the geese are completely cooled, remove them from the broth and unwrap them from the napkins.

10. Place the geese on a serving platter or individual plates, garnished with fresh parsley and lemon slices.

11. Serve the Green Geese a la Daube cold as a main dish.
