## Ingredients:
- Musk
- Scented water (such as rosewater or lavender water)

## Instructions:
1. Dissolve musk in scented water. The amount of musk and scented water can vary depending on personal preference, but a small amount of musk and enough scented water to create a fragrant solution should be sufficient.
2. Take about the quantity of one wash ball of the composition. The exact composition of the paste is not specified, so you can use a base such as clay, starch, or powdered herbs.
3. Mix the dissolved musk and scented water with the paste in a mortar. Use a pestle to thoroughly combine the ingredients until a smooth mixture is formed.
4. Once the mixture is well-mixed, shape it into small balls. The size of the balls can vary depending on personal preference, but aim for a size that is comfortable to hold and use.
