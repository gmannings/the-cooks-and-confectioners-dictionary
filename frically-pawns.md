# Frically Pawns

## Description
Frically Pawns is a dish made with shrimp cooked in a flavorful sauce. The shrimp is first stewed with wine, onion, anchovies, and herbs, and then fried with egg yolk, butter, and vinegar. It is traditionally served on sippets, which are small pieces of toasted bread.

## Ingredients:
- 500g shrimp, peeled and deveined
- 250ml red wine (Claret)
- 1 small onion, thinly sliced
- 2 anchovy fillets, finely chopped
- 1 bunch of fresh herbs (such as parsley, thyme, and bay leaves)
- 1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg
- 1/2 teaspoon ground ginger
- 2 egg yolks
- 50g butter
- 2 tablespoons vinegar
- Sippets (small pieces of toasted bread), for serving

## Instructions:
1. In a large dish, combine the shrimp, red wine, sliced onion, chopped anchovies, and fresh herbs.
2. Place the dish over a low heat on a stovetop or a chafing dish of coals. Add the ground nutmeg and ginger. Stew the mixture gently for about 10 minutes, until the shrimp are cooked through and the flavors have melded together.
3. Remove the shrimp from the dish and set aside.
4. In a frying pan, melt the butter over medium heat.
5. In a small bowl, whisk together the egg yolks and vinegar.
6. Add the egg yolk mixture to the frying pan and cook for a minute or two, until it thickens slightly.
7. Add the cooked shrimp to the frying pan and toss to coat them in the sauce. Cook for another minute or two, until the shrimp are heated through.
8. Serve the frically pawns on sippets, garnished with fresh herbs if desired.
