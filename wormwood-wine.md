# Wormwood Wine

## Description
Wormwood wine is a traditional herbal wine made by infusing dried wormwood in Rhenish wine. It has a bitter and aromatic flavor and was commonly used as a medicinal tonic in the 18th century.

## Ingredients:
- 2 pounds (900 grams) dried wormwood
- 2 gallons (7.6 liters) Rhenish wine (or any dry white wine)

## Instructions:
1. In a large glass or ceramic container, combine the dried wormwood and Rhenish wine.
2. Cover the container and let the mixture steep for three to four months. During this time, shake the container gently every few days to help extract the flavors from the wormwood.
3. After the steeping period, the wine will have absorbed the flavors of the wormwood.
4. Carefully decant the clear tincture from the container, leaving behind any sediment or solids.
5. Transfer the wormwood wine to clean bottles for storage and use.

## Options and commentary
- If you cannot find Rhenish wine, you can use any dry white wine as a substitute.
- Wormwood can be quite bitter, so you may want to adjust the amount of wormwood used according to your taste preferences.
- This wormwood wine can be enjoyed as a digestive tonic or used in cocktails and mixed drinks.

## Cooking time
3-4 months (steeping period)
