# Carrot Soup

## Description
Carrot Soup is a creamy and flavorful soup made with boiled carrots, butter, white wine, and a hint of sweetness from cinnamon, sugar, dates, and currants. It is a comforting and nutritious dish that can be enjoyed as a starter or a light meal.

## Options and commentary
- For a vegetarian version, substitute the butter with olive oil or vegetable oil.
- You can adjust the sweetness of the soup by adding more or less sugar according to your taste.
- Feel free to garnish the soup with fresh herbs like parsley or chives for added flavor and presentation.

## Ingredients:
- 500g carrots, peeled and chopped
- 2 tablespoons butter (or olive oil for a vegetarian version)
- 1/4 cup white wine
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
- 2 tablespoons sugar
- 4 dates, sliced
- 1/4 cup boiled currants
- Sippets (small pieces of toasted bread)
- Hard-boiled eggs, halved or quartered, for garnish
- Sugar, for garnish

## Instructions:
1. In a large pot, bring water to a boil and add the chopped carrots. Cook until the carrots are tender, about 15-20 minutes.
2. Drain the cooked carrots and transfer them to a mortar or wooden tray. Mash the carrots using a pestle or a wooden spoon until they form a smooth paste.
3. In a pipkin or a saucepan, melt the butter over medium heat. Add the mashed carrots and stir to combine.
4. Pour in the white wine and continue stirring for a minute to cook off the alcohol.
5. Add the salt, ground cinnamon, sugar, sliced dates, and boiled currants to the pot. Stir well to incorporate all the ingredients.
6. Reduce the heat to low and let the soup simmer for about 10 minutes, stirring occasionally to prevent sticking.
7. While the soup is simmering, prepare the sippets by toasting small pieces of bread until they are crispy.
8. Once the soup has thickened slightly and the flavors have melded together, remove it from the heat.
9. To serve, ladle the carrot soup into bowls and garnish with hard-boiled egg halves or quarters. Sprinkle some sugar on top for added sweetness.
10. Enjoy the Carrot Soup hot with the sippets on the side.
