# Louced and Collared Soles

## Description
Louced and collared soles are a dish made with sole fish that is boned, minced, seasoned, rolled up, and then boiled and pickled. The fish is filled with a mixture of minced salmon, oysters, prawns or shrimps, hard-boiled egg yolks, anchovies, and savory herbs. It is then rolled up into collars, tied with tape, boiled, and finally pickled in a mixture of wine, water, vinegar, salt, spices, and sweet herbs.

## Options and commentary
- Instead of sole fish, you can use any other white fish fillets such as cod or haddock.
- Feel free to adjust the seasoning according to your taste preferences.
- The pickling liquid can be customized by adding additional spices or herbs.

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F).
2. Bone the sole fish fillets by carefully removing the bones with a sharp knife. Alternatively, you can ask your fishmonger to bone the fish for you.
3. Scrape or skin the fish fillets to remove any remaining scales or skin.
4. In a bowl, combine the minced salmon, minced oysters, minced prawns or shrimps, mashed hard-boiled egg yolks, minced anchovies, and finely chopped savory herbs.
5. Season the mixture with salt, pepper, ground ginger, ground cloves, and ground nutmeg. Mix well to combine.
6. Lay the sole fish fillets flat on a clean surface and pat them dry with a paper towel.
7. In a separate bowl, beat the egg yolks.
8. Brush the egg yolks onto the surface of the fish fillets.
9. Spread the minced fish and seasoning mixture evenly over the fish fillets.
10. Roll up each fish fillet into a collar shape and secure with cooking twine or tape.
11. Place the rolled fish collars in a large pot or Dutch oven.
12. In a separate saucepan, combine the white wine, water, vinegar, salt, and whole spices. Bring the mixture to a boil.
13. Pour the boiling pickling liquid over the fish collars in the pot, making sure they are fully submerged.
14. Add fresh sweet herbs to the pot for added flavor.
15. Cover the pot and bring the liquid back to a boil.
16. Reduce the heat to low and simmer the fish collars for about 20 minutes, or until they are cooked through and tender.
17. Remove the pot from the heat and allow the fish collars to cool in the pickling liquid.
18. Once cooled, remove the fish collars from the liquid and discard the twine or tape.
19. Serve the louced and collared soles chilled as an appetizer or as part of a seafood platter.
