# Fouce Lumps

## Description
Fouce Lumps is a dish made from boiled lumps of meat, typically pork, that are stuffed with a mixture of seafood, herbs, and spices. The lumps are then baked until golden and crispy on the outside.

## Options and commentary
- Instead of pork, you can use chicken or beef for the lumps.
- For the seafood stuffing, you can use a combination of lobster tails, large oysters, and prawns. If these are not available, you can substitute with crab meat or shrimp.
- The addition of grated bread helps bind the stuffing together. You can use breadcrumbs or panko.
- The spices used in the stuffing include salt, ginger, mace, cloves, and nutmeg. Adjust the quantities according to your taste preferences.
- The anchovy adds a savory umami flavor to the stuffing. If you don't like anchovies, you can omit them or substitute with a small amount of fish sauce.

## Ingredients:
- 500g pork loin (or chicken/beef)
- 2 lobster tails
- 6 large oysters
- 200g prawns (or crab meat/shrimp)
- 2 hard-boiled eggs, yolks only
- 2 tablespoons fresh herbs (such as parsley, thyme, or chives), finely chopped
- 50g grated bread (breadcrumbs or panko)
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 1 teaspoon ground ginger
- 1/2 teaspoon ground mace
- 1/2 teaspoon ground cloves
- 1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg
- 4 anchovy fillets (optional)

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F).
2. Scald the lumps (pork loin, chicken, or beef) by pouring boiling water over them and then scraping off any impurities. 
3. Boil the lumps in their skins until cooked through. This will depend on the size and type of meat used. For pork loin, it may take around 30-40 minutes. For chicken or beef, adjust the cooking time accordingly. Once cooked, remove the skins and set the lumps aside to cool slightly.
4. In the meantime, prepare the seafood stuffing. Remove the meat from the lobster tails and chop it into small pieces. Drain and chop the oysters. Peel and chop the prawns. Place all the seafood in a bowl.
5. Add the yolks of the hard-boiled eggs to the bowl with the seafood. Mash the yolks with a fork to break them up.
6. Add the finely chopped fresh herbs, grated bread, salt, ginger, mace, cloves, and nutmeg to the bowl. Mix everything together until well combined.
7. If using anchovy fillets, chop them finely and add them to the bowl. Mix again to distribute the anchovy flavor throughout the stuffing.
8. Take each lump and carefully cut a slit along one side, creating a pocket for the stuffing. Be careful not to cut all the way through.
9. Stuff each lump with the seafood mixture, ensuring that it is evenly distributed.
10. Place the stuffed lumps on a baking tray and bake in the preheated oven for about 20-25 minutes, or until the lumps are golden and crispy on the outside.
11. Remove from the oven and let the lumps rest for a few minutes before serving.
