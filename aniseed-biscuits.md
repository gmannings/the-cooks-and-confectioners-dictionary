# Aniseed Biscuits

## Description
Aniseed biscuits are a sweet and crunchy treat that can be enjoyed on their own or served with tea or coffee. These biscuits are made with a combination of flour, yeast, aniseeds, eggs, cream, and sugar. The dough is shaped into a loaf, baked, and then sliced into thin pieces. The slices are dried in an oven and coated with powdered sugar multiple times to create a crispy texture and a sweet taste.

## Ingredients:
- 500 grams of flour
- 150 milliliters of yeast
- 40 grams of aniseeds
- 4 eggs
- 200 milliliters of sweet cream
- Cold water
- Powdered sugar

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 180Â°C.
2. In a large mixing bowl, combine the flour, yeast, and aniseeds.
3. In a separate bowl, beat the eggs.
4. Add the beaten eggs to the flour mixture and mix well.
5. Gradually add the sweet cream and enough cold water to form a dough. The dough should be soft and pliable.
6. Knead the dough on a lightly floured surface for about 5 minutes until it becomes smooth and elastic.
7. Shape the dough into a loaf shape and place it on a baking sheet.
8. Bake the loaf in the preheated oven for about 40-45 minutes, or until it is golden brown and cooked through.
9. Remove the loaf from the oven and let it cool completely.
10. Once the loaf is completely cooled, use a sharp knife to slice it into thin slices, about 1/4 inch thick.
11. Preheat the oven to its lowest setting or use a warm stove.
12. Place the sliced biscuits on a baking sheet and sprinkle them generously with powdered sugar.
13. Place the baking sheet in the warm oven or stove and allow the biscuits to dry for about 1-2 hours, or until they are crisp.
14. Remove the baking sheet from the oven and let the biscuits cool completely.
15. Repeat steps 12-14 two more times, coating the biscuits with powdered sugar and drying them each time.
16. Once the biscuits are completely dry and crisp, store them in an airtight container for future use.
