# Dzel's Venison in a Ragout

## Description
This recipe is for a hearty and flavorful venison dish. The venison is larded with bacon and then cooked in a rich sauce made with broth, white wine, and aromatic herbs. The sauce is thickened and served with lemon peel and capers for added brightness.

## Ingredients:
- 1 kg venison (can use deer or other game meat)
- 200 g bacon, cut into thick strips
- Salt and pepper, to taste
- 100 g lard or cooking oil
- 500 ml broth (beef or game)
- 250 ml white wine
- Salt, to taste
- 1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg
- 2-3 bay leaves
- 1 piece of green lemon (unripe lemon), sliced
- 1 faggot of sweet herbs (bundle of fresh herbs such as thyme, rosemary, and parsley)
- 2 tablespoons flour
- Lemon peel, for garnish
- Capers, for garnish

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 180Â°C.
2. Using a sharp knife, make small incisions in the venison and insert the bacon strips into the incisions. Season the venison with salt and pepper.
3. Heat the lard or cooking oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the venison and cook until browned on all sides. Alternatively, you can toss the venison in a saucepan with melted bacon.
4. Transfer the venison to an ovenproof earthen pan or casserole dish.
5. In the same skillet used to cook the venison, add the broth, white wine, salt, nutmeg, bay leaves, green lemon slices, and faggot of sweet herbs. Bring the mixture to a simmer and cook for a few minutes to infuse the flavors.
6. Pour the sauce over the venison in the earthen pan. Cover the pan with a lid or aluminum foil.
7. Place the pan in the preheated oven and cook for 3-4 hours, or until the venison is tender and cooked through.
8. Remove the venison from the pan and keep warm.
9. Strain the cooking liquid from the pan into a saucepan. Discard the bay leaves, lemon slices, and sweet herbs.
10. In a small bowl, mix the flour with a little water to make a smooth paste. Gradually whisk the flour paste into the cooking liquid to thicken the sauce. Cook over medium heat until the sauce has thickened to your desired consistency.
11. Slice the venison and arrange on a serving platter. Pour the thickened sauce over the venison.
12. Garnish with lemon peel and capers before serving.
