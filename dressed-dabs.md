# Dressed Dabs

## Description
Dressed Dabs is a dish made with cooked and filleted dabs (a type of flatfish) that are then dressed with a variety of seasonings and served cold as a salad or hot with a sauce. It can be served as an appetizer or a side dish.

## Options and commentary
- You can choose to dress the dabs with a simple vinaigrette made with salt, pepper, vinegar, and oil, or with an anchovy sauce for a more savory flavor.
- Another option is to bake the dabs in a pie, similar to how turbot is prepared.
- Alternatively, you can serve the dabs whole and hot with a white sauce and cream as a side dish.

## Ingredients:
- 4 dabs (or any other flatfish)
- Salt
- Pepper
- Vinegar
- Oil
- Sallet herbs (such as lettuce, arugula, or watercress)
- Anchovy sauce (optional)
- White sauce (optional)
- Cream (optional)

## Instructions:
1. In a large pot, prepare a court bouillon by bringing water to a boil and adding aromatic vegetables and herbs such as onions, carrots, celery, parsley, and bay leaves. Season the court bouillon with salt and pepper.
2. Once the court bouillon is boiling, add the dabs and cook them until they are fully cooked and tender. This should take about 5-7 minutes.
3. Remove the dabs from the court bouillon and let them cool.
4. Once the dabs are cold, carefully remove the skin and bones, and cut the fish into fillets.
5. In a bowl, combine the fillets with the sallet herbs and toss gently to mix.
6. Season the dressed dabs with salt, pepper, vinegar, and oil. Alternatively, you can dress them with anchovy sauce for a more intense flavor.
7. If serving cold as a salad, arrange the dressed dabs on a plate and serve as an appetizer or intermezzo.
8. If baking in a pie, follow a turbot pie recipe and substitute the turbot with the dressed dabs.
9. If serving hot as a side dish, leave the dabs whole and heat them gently in a pan with a white sauce and cream until warmed through.
10. Serve the hot dressed dabs with the white sauce and cream as a side dish.
