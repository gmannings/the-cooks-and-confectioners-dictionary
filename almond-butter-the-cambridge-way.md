# Almond Butter, the Cambridge Way

## Description
This recipe is for a creamy and sweet almond butter, made with eggs, cream, almonds, and sugar. It is a delicious spread that can be enjoyed with bread or used as a topping for desserts.

## Options and commentary
- You can use heavy cream or whipping cream as a modern alternative to the "quart of cream" mentioned in the original recipe.
- Instead of beating 16 eggs, you can use 8 large eggs or 10 medium eggs.
- Sack is a type of fortified wine, similar to sherry. You can substitute it with a sweet white wine or omit it altogether.
- Blanching almonds involves removing their skins. You can either buy blanched almonds or blanch them yourself by pouring boiling water over the almonds and then removing the skins.
- Rose water can be found in specialty stores or online. If you can't find it, you can use almond extract or vanilla extract as a substitute.

## Ingredients:
- 1 liter of heavy cream
- 8 large eggs, beaten
- 120 ml of sweet white wine (optional)
- 250 grams of blanched almonds
- 1 tablespoon of rose water
- 350 grams of fine sugar

## Instructions:
1. In a large saucepan, combine the heavy cream, beaten eggs, and sweet white wine (if using). Place the saucepan over low heat.
2. Continuously stir the mixture with a whisk or wooden spoon to prevent it from sticking to the bottom of the pan.
3. When the mixture is about to boil and starts to thicken, remove it from the heat.
4. Strain the mixture through a fine-mesh sieve to remove any curds or lumps. Set aside.
5. In a mortar and pestle or a food processor, grind the blanched almonds until they form a fine powder.
6. Add the rose water to the ground almonds and mix well.
7. Transfer the strained mixture (curds) into a wooden or stone mortar.
8. Gradually add the almond mixture to the curds, beating them together with a pestle or a wooden spoon.
9. Add the fine sugar to the mixture and continue beating until everything is well combined and the mixture has a smooth consistency.
10. Spoon the almond butter into pots or glasses for storage.
11. Allow the almond butter to cool completely before covering and refrigerating.
12. The almond butter can be enjoyed with bread or used as a topping for desserts. It will keep well for two to three months when stored in the refrigerator.
