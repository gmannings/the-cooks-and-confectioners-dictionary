# Surfcit-Water

## Description
Surfcit-Water is a cordial made from a mixture of spirits, water, poppies, and anise seeds. It is sweetened with sugar and colored with red Saunders (sandalwood).

## Ingredients:
- 18.9 liters of strong spirits
- 9.5 liters of water
- 0.5 bushel of red poppies (approximately 17.5 liters)
- 227 grams of anise seeds
- 7 pounds (3.2 kilograms) of fine sugar
- Red Saunders (sandalwood) for coloring

## Instructions:
1. In a large container, combine the strong spirits and water.
2. Add the red poppies and anise seeds to the mixture.
3. Stir the mixture well to ensure all the ingredients are evenly distributed.
4. Cover the container and let the mixture steep for at least 24 hours.
5. After steeping, strain the mixture through a fine-mesh sieve or cheesecloth to remove the solids.
6. Measure the volume of the strained liquid. If it is less than 7 gallons (approximately 26.5 liters), add enough water to make up the difference.
7. In a separate container, dissolve 7 pounds (3.2 kilograms) of fine sugar in a small amount of warm water to create a sugar syrup.
8. Add the sugar syrup to the strained liquid and mix well to ensure the sugar is fully dissolved.
9. If desired, add a few drops of red Saunders (sandalwood) to the mixture to achieve the desired color. Stir well to distribute the color evenly.
10. Transfer the Surfcit-Water to clean, sterilized bottles or jars with tight-fitting lids.
11. Seal the bottles or jars and store them in a cool, dark place for at least a week to allow the flavors to meld and develop.
12. After a week, the Surfcit-Water is ready to be enjoyed.

## Cooking time
Approximately 24 hours for steeping, plus at least 1 week for aging.
