# Rare Frically

## Description
Rare Frically is a rich and flavorful dish made with a combination of chicken, pigeon, lamb, sweetbreads, asparagus, eggs, marrow, pistachios, and spices. It is stewed in a savory sauce and served with a garnish of fried oysters, sweetbreads, marrow, almonds, pistachios, and orange juice.

## Options and commentary
- You can adjust the quantities of the ingredients based on your preference and the number of servings you want to make.
- If you don't have access to pigeon, you can use additional chicken or another type of poultry.
- If you prefer a vegetarian version, you can omit the meat and use vegetable broth instead of mutton gravy.
- The dish can be served with crusty bread or over rice or pasta.

## Ingredients:
- 6 chicken pieces
- 6 pigeon breasts
- 6 lamb bones
- 2 sweetbreads, blanched and sliced
- 1 cup asparagus tips, cut into 1-inch pieces
- 2 hard-boiled eggs, yolks only
- 6 marrow bones, halved
- 1/4 cup pistachios
- 4 tablespoons butter
- Salt and pepper to taste
- Grated nutmeg to taste
- 1/4 cup white wine
- 2 cloves garlic, minced (optional)
- 6 large oysters, fried
- 6 eggs, yolks only, dissolved in 1/4 cup wine vinegar or verjuice
- 1/4 teaspoon ground mace
- 1 French loaf, sliced
- Mutton gravy or vegetable broth
- Sliced almonds for garnish
- Pistachios for garnish
- Juice of 2-3 oranges

## Instructions:
1. Scald the chickens and pigeons, then truss them.
2. Blanch the lamb bones and sweetbreads. Parboil them and slice the sweetbreads. Fry most of the sweetbreads that have been coated in flour.
3. In a separate pan, fry the asparagus tips, yolks of hard-boiled eggs, half of the marrow, and pistachios in white butter until green. Keep warm.
4. In a clean frying pan, fry the chickens and pigeons in sweet butter. Once fried, remove the butter and add mutton gravy, salt, and fried oysters.
5. Add the remaining sweetbreads, yolks of hard-boiled eggs, the other half of the marrow, pistachios, asparagus tips, pepper, grated nutmeg, white wine, and minced garlic (if using). Stew them together.
6. Dissolve the yolks of 6 eggs in a dish with wine vinegar or verjuice and beaten mace. Add this mixture to the fricassée.
7. Place a large dish on a chafing dish of coals. Slice a French loaf into the dish and pour in some mutton gravy.
8. Give the fricassée two or three turns on the fire and pour it into the dish.
9. Garnish with fried oysters, fried sweetbreads, fried marrow, sliced almonds, pistachios, and the juice of 2-3 oranges.
