# Roasted Loin of Veal

## Description
This recipe is for a classic roasted loin of veal. The veal is seasoned with herbs and roasted to perfection, resulting in a tender and flavorful dish.

## Ingredients:
- 1 loin of veal
- Salt and pepper to taste
- 2 tablespoons unsalted butter
- 2 tablespoons vinegar
- A few sage leaves
- A sprig of rosemary
- A sprig of thyme

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F).
2. Place the loin of veal on a roasting pan and season it generously with salt and pepper.
3. Spread the butter evenly over the surface of the veal.
4. In the bottom of the roasting pan, add the vinegar, sage leaves, rosemary, and thyme.
5. Place the roasting pan in the preheated oven and roast the veal for about 20 minutes per pound, or until the internal temperature reaches 63°C (145°F) for medium-rare.
6. While the veal is roasting, baste it occasionally with the pan juices.
7. Once the veal is cooked to your desired doneness, remove it from the oven and transfer it to a serving platter.
8. Strain the pan juices, discarding the herbs, and heat them in a small saucepan over medium heat for a few minutes to reduce and concentrate the flavors.
