# Roasted Pig with Crispy Skin

## Description
This recipe is for roasting a whole pig with the hair on, resulting in a crispy and flavorful skin. The pig is prepared by cleaning and trussing, then roasted over an open fire. The skin is then removed along with the hair, and the pig is basted with a mixture of butter and cream. It is then coated with a mixture of salt, sugar, and grated bread, creating a crispy crust. The pig is served whole with a sweet and tangy sauce made from wine vinegar, cloves, cinnamon, and sugar.

## Options and commentary
- Instead of roasting the pig over an open fire, you can use a modern oven set to a high temperature.
- If you prefer a less fatty dish, you can remove the skin before roasting and proceed with the basting and coating steps.
- The sauce can be adjusted to personal taste by adding more or less sugar, vinegar, or spices.

## Ingredients:
- 1 whole pig (approximately 10-15 kg)
- Guts, liver, and lights (optional, for those who enjoy offal)
- Butter, for basting
- Cream, for basting
- Salt
- Sugar
- Grated bread
- Wine vinegar
- Whole cloves
- Whole cinnamon

## Instructions:
1. Preheat your oven to 220°C (425°F) or prepare a fire for roasting the pig.
2. Clean the pig thoroughly, removing any dirt or debris. Make a small incision at the vent and remove the guts, liver, and lights if desired.
3. Cut off the pig's feet and truss the pig to keep it in a compact shape.
4. Prick the pig's belly with a fork to allow the fat to render during cooking.
5. If roasting over a fire, carefully spit the pig and secure it over the fire, making sure it is evenly rotated. If using an oven, place the pig on a roasting rack in a large roasting pan.
6. Roast the pig, basting it every 30 minutes with a mixture of warm butter and cream. This will help keep the meat moist and add flavor.
7. While the pig is roasting, prepare the coating mixture. In a bowl, combine salt, sugar, and grated bread. Mix well.
8. Once the pig's skin begins to blister and rise, carefully remove the skin and hair using a sharp knife or kitchen shears. Take care not to burn yourself.
9. Baste the pig one final time with the butter and cream mixture.
10. Sprinkle the coating mixture evenly over the pig, making sure to cover it with a layer that is about half an inch to an inch thick.
11. Continue roasting the pig until it is cooked through and the skin is crispy and golden brown. This will take approximately 4-6 hours, depending on the size of the pig and the cooking method.
12. While the pig is roasting, prepare the sauce. In a saucepan, combine wine vinegar, whole cloves, whole cinnamon, and sugar. Bring the mixture to a boil and let it simmer until it thickens into a syrup-like consistency.
13. Once the pig is fully cooked, remove it from the oven or fire and let it rest for 15-20 minutes before carving.
14. Serve the roasted pig whole, with the crispy skin intact, and the sauce on the side.

## Cooking time
4-6 hours (depending on the size of the pig and the cooking method)
