# Pye of Theeps-tongues

## Description
This recipe is for a savory pie made with thinly sliced boiled tongues. The tongues are seasoned with pepper, ginger, and cinnamon, then combined with sweet butter and herbs in a pie crust. While the pie is baking, a flavorful sauce is made with butter, vinegar, sack (a type of fortified wine), egg yolk, lemon juice, nutmeg, and sugar. The sauce is then poured over the pie when it comes out of the oven, creating a delicious and rich dish.

## Ingredients:
- 2 theeps-tongues
- Pepper
- Ginger
- Cinnamon
- 100g sweet butter
- Assorted sweet herbs (such as parsley, thyme, or rosemary)
- 1 pie crust
- 50g butter
- 2 tablespoons vinegar
- 1 tablespoon sack (or substitute with white wine)
- 1 egg yolk
- Juice of 1 lemon
- Nutmeg
- Sugar

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 180Â°C.
2. In a large pot, bring water to a boil and add the theeps-tongues. Boil them until tender.
3. Remove the tongues from the pot and let them cool slightly. Peel off the outer skin and blanch the tongues by placing them in a bowl of cold water for a few minutes. This will help remove any remaining impurities.
4. Once blanched, thinly slice the tongues.
5. Season the sliced tongues with pepper, ginger, and cinnamon. Set aside.
6. In a separate bowl, combine the sweet butter and chopped sweet herbs.
7. Roll out the pie crust and line a pie dish with it.
8. Spread the sweet butter and herb mixture evenly over the bottom of the pie crust.
9. Arrange the seasoned sliced tongues on top of the butter and herb mixture.
10. Cover the pie with a second layer of pie crust and seal the edges.
11. Place the pie in the preheated oven and bake for approximately 30-40 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown.
12. While the pie is baking, prepare the sauce. In a small saucepan, melt the butter over low heat.
13. Add the vinegar, sack (or white wine), egg yolk, lemon juice, a pinch of nutmeg, and a teaspoon of sugar to the saucepan. Stir well to combine.
14. Simmer the sauce over a chafing-dish of coals or on the stovetop over low heat until it thickens slightly.
15. Once the pie is baked, remove it from the oven and pour the prepared sauce over the top of the pie.
16. Serve the Pye of Theeps-tongues hot.

## Cooking time
Approximately 30-40 minutes for baking the pie.
