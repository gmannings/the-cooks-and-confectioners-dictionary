# Jelly Damlons

## Description
Jelly Damlons is a sweet jelly made from damsons (a type of plum) and flavored with green apples, green gooseberries, and quince cores. It is a delicious spread that can be enjoyed on toast or used as a filling for pastries.

## Ingredients:
- 3.6 kg damsons
- 3.6 kg fine sugar
- 120 ml water
- 1 kg green apples
- 1 kg green gooseberries
- Quince cores (from 2-3 quinces)

## Instructions:
1. Wash the damsons and remove any stems or leaves.
2. In a large pot, combine the damsons, sugar, and water.
3. Place the pot over a gentle fire and bring to a boil. Cook for about 30 minutes or until the damson skins break.
4. Remove the pot from the fire and set aside for 1 hour.
5. Return the pot to the fire and boil for another 30 minutes. Set aside for 1 hour.
6. Repeat step 5 two more times, boiling for 30 minutes and setting aside for 1 hour each time.
7. While the damsons are off the fire, place a weight on top of them to keep them submerged in the syrup.
8. For the final boiling, continue cooking until the damsons are of a very high color in the part where the skin is broken.
9. Remove the pot from the fire and set aside to cool.
10. Once the damsons are cold, drain away the syrup and set it aside.
11. In a separate pot, boil the green apples, green gooseberries, and quince cores until they form a mash.
12. Strain the mixture through a fine-mesh sieve or a hair sieve to remove any solids.
13. Measure out an equal quantity of the damson syrup and the apple-gooseberry-quince jelly.
14. Combine the two jellies in a pot and place it over a gentle fire.
15. Bring the mixture to a boil and cook until it reaches the desired jelly consistency. Be careful not to boil it too high, as it may become too thick and rope-like.
16. Skim off any impurities that rise to the surface.
17. While the jelly is still hot, pour it into clean glass jars or pots.
18. Allow the jelly to cool completely before sealing the jars.
