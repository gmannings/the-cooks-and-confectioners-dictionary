# Fried Artichokes with Orange Sauce

## Description
This recipe is a modernized version of a dish from the 18th century cookbook. It features artichokes that are boiled, sliced, and fried until crispy. The fried artichokes are then topped with marrow and garnished with oranges. The dish is served with a tangy sauce made with verjuice, butter, sugar, and orange juice.

## Ingredients:
- 4 artichokes
- 1 cup all-purpose flour
- 1 cup milk
- Salt and pepper, to taste
- Butter, for frying
- 4 marrow bones
- 2 oranges
- 1/4 cup verjuice (or substitute with white wine vinegar)
- 2 tablespoons butter
- 2 tablespoons sugar

## Instructions:
1. Fill a large pot with water and bring it to a boil.
2. While the water is heating, prepare the artichokes by removing the tough outer leaves and trimming the tops.
3. Once the water is boiling, add the artichokes and cook them for about 20 minutes, or until they are tender when pierced with a fork.
4. Remove the artichokes from the pot and let them cool slightly.
5. Cut each artichoke in half lengthwise, and then cut each half into quarters.
6. In a shallow bowl, whisk together the flour, milk, salt, and pepper to make a batter.
7. Heat a large skillet over medium heat and add enough butter to coat the bottom of the pan.
8. Dip each artichoke quarter into the batter, allowing any excess to drip off, and then place them in the skillet.
9. Fry the artichokes for about 2-3 minutes on each side, or until they are golden brown and crispy.
10. While the artichokes are frying, prepare the marrow bones by boiling them in a separate pot of water for about 10 minutes, or until they are cooked through.
11. Remove the marrow bones from the pot and set them aside.
12. Peel and segment one of the oranges.
13. In a small saucepan, combine the verjuice, butter, sugar, and the juice of the remaining orange.
14. Heat the saucepan over medium heat and cook the mixture until the butter has melted and the sauce has thickened slightly.
15. To serve, place the fried artichokes on a platter and top each one with a marrow bone.
16. Garnish the platter with the orange segments.
17. Drizzle the sauce over the artichokes and serve immediately.
