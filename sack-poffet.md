# Sack Poffet

## Description
Sack Poffet is a creamy and sweet custard-like dessert that was popular in the 18th century. It is made with cream, eggs, sugar, and flavored with spices and Canary wine. The dessert has a smooth and velvety texture and is served chilled.

## Ingredients:
- 1 quart (946 ml) of cream
- Whole spices (such as cinnamon, cloves, and nutmeg)
- 6 eggs
- Sugar, to taste
- Canary wine (a type of fortified wine), to taste

## Instructions:
1. In a saucepan, combine the cream and whole spices. Heat the mixture over medium heat until it comes to a gentle boil. 
2. While the cream is heating, crack the eggs into a bowl and whisk them together.
3. Once the cream is boiling, remove the whole spices from the saucepan.
4. Gradually pour the hot cream into the bowl with the whisked eggs, whisking constantly to prevent the eggs from curdling.
5. Return the mixture to the saucepan and place it back on the heat.
6. Add sugar to the mixture, stirring continuously until it is sweetened to your liking.
7. Pour in Canary wine, adjusting the amount to your taste preference. Stir well to incorporate.
8. Allow the mixture to heat gently, stirring constantly, until it thickens to a custard-like consistency. This should take about 10-15 minutes.
9. Once the mixture has thickened, remove it from the heat and let it cool slightly.
10. Using a ladle, gently transfer the thickened mixture into individual serving bowls or a large serving bowl.
11. Place the bowls in the refrigerator to chill for at least 2 hours, or until set.
12. Serve the Sack Poffet chilled.

## Options and commentary:
- You can experiment with different spices such as cardamom or allspice to add more flavor to the dessert.
- If you don't have Canary wine, you can substitute it with another sweet white wine or a fortified wine like sherry.
- To make the dessert more visually appealing, you can sprinkle some ground cinnamon or grated nutmeg on top before serving.
