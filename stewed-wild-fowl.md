# Stewed Wild Fowl

## Description
This recipe involves roasting and then stewing wild fowl in a flavorful sauce made with claret, gravy, spices, shallots, anchovies, and butter. The result is a tender and flavorful dish with a rich sauce.

## Ingredients:
- 2 wild fowl (such as duck or pheasant)
- 250 ml claret (red wine)
- 250 ml gravy (chicken or beef)
- 1/2 teaspoon whole black pepper
- 1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg
- 2-3 shallots, finely chopped
- 2 anchovies, finely chopped
- 50 grams unsalted butter

## Instructions:

2. Place the wild fowl on a roasting rack in a roasting pan and roast for about 30 minutes, or until the skin is golden brown and crispy.
3. Remove the wild fowl from the oven and let them cool slightly. Cut them into joints, separating the legs, wings, and breasts.
