# To Fouce a Calf's Head

## Description
This recipe involves preparing and cooking a calf's head in a flavorful broth, then serving it either in a rolled collar or sliced, with a dressing of oil, vinegar, and pepper. It is a traditional dish from the 18th century.

## Ingredients:
- 1 calf's head
- Salt
- 2 cloves of garlic, crushed
- 1 cup white wine
- Water
- Oil
- Vinegar
- Pepper

## Instructions:
1. Start by peeling off the skin from the calf's head and removing the bones. 
2. Place the head in a large bowl of water and let it soak for seven to eight hours, changing the water twice during this time.
3. After soaking, pat the head dry with a cloth.
4. Season the head with salt and crushed garlic, rubbing it all over.
5. Roll up the head tightly into a collar shape and secure it with kitchen twine.
6. In a large pot, combine the white wine, enough water to cover the head, and a pinch of salt. Bring the liquid to a boil.
7. Carefully place the rolled calf's head into the boiling liquid and reduce the heat to a simmer.
8. Cook the head for about 2-3 hours, or until it is tender and cooked through. 
9. Once cooked, remove the head from the pot and set it aside to cool slightly.
10. Strain the cooking liquid and reserve it for later use.
11. Once the head is cool enough to handle, remove the twine and slice it into thick slices.
12. To serve, arrange the sliced head on a platter and drizzle with oil, vinegar, and a sprinkle of pepper. Alternatively, you can serve it in the rolled collar shape.
13. If desired, you can also serve the reserved cooking liquid as a broth on the side.
