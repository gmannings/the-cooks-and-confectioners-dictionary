# Cullis of Ducks

## Description
Cullis of Ducks is a rich and flavorful dish made with roasted duck, gammon (cured ham), lentils, and a variety of herbs and spices. The duck and gammon are pounded together to create a thick paste, which is then stewed with lentils and seasonings. The mixture is further cooked with melted bacon and veal gravy to create a smooth and savory sauce. This dish is perfect for those who enjoy hearty and comforting meals.

## Ingredients:
- 1 roasted duck
- 200g gammon (cured ham)
- 1 cup lentils
- 1 clove of garlic
- 3-4 cloves
- A handful of chives
- A handful of savory
- 4 slices of bacon
- 1 cup veal gravy

## Instructions:
1. Remove the meat from the roasted duck and place it in a mortar. Pound the meat until it forms a smooth paste.
2. In a frying pan, fry the gammon until it turns brown and crispy. Remove the gammon from the pan and set it aside.
3. In a pot, combine the lentils, garlic, cloves, chives, and savory. Add enough water to cover the lentils and bring the mixture to a boil. Reduce the heat and let it simmer until the lentils are tender.
4. Once the lentils are cooked, add the pounded duck meat and the fried gammon to the pot. Stir everything together.
5. In a separate saucepan, melt the bacon slices until they release their fat. Add the duck and lentil mixture to the saucepan and mix well.
6. Pour in the veal gravy and stir until everything is well combined. Let the mixture simmer for a few more minutes to allow the flavors to meld together.
7. Strain the cullis through a fine-mesh sieve to remove any lumps or solids.
8. Serve the cullis of ducks hot, either as a sauce for roasted meats or as a standalone dish.
