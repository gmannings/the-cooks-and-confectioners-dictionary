# Chocolate Biscuits

## Description
These chocolate biscuits are made by combining chocolate, egg whites, and powdered sugar to create a pliable dough. The dough is then shaped and baked until crispy. These biscuits have a rich chocolate flavor and a slightly sweet taste.

## Ingredients:
- 50g chocolate (dark or semi-sweet)
- 2 egg whites
- 100g powdered sugar

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F).
2. Grate the chocolate using a fine grater or chop it finely.
3. In a mixing bowl, combine the grated chocolate and egg whites.
4. Mix well until the chocolate is evenly distributed throughout the egg whites.
5. Gradually add the powdered sugar to the chocolate and egg white mixture.
6. Stir until the mixture forms a pliable dough. Add more powdered sugar if needed to achieve the desired consistency.
7. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
8. Using a spoon or a piping bag, shape the dough into biscuits on the parchment paper. You can make them round, oval, or any other shape you prefer.
9. Place the baking sheet in the preheated oven.
10. Bake the biscuits for about 10-12 minutes, or until they are firm to the touch and slightly golden around the edges.
11. Remove the biscuits from the oven and let them cool completely on a wire rack.
12. Once cooled, the chocolate biscuits are ready to be enjoyed.
