# Banbury Cakes

## Description
Banbury Cakes are a traditional English pastry filled with currants and spices. They have a flaky pastry crust and a sweet, fruity filling.

## Options and commentary
- You can use either all-purpose flour or bread flour for this recipe. Bread flour will give the pastry a slightly chewier texture.
- If you don't have ale-yeast, you can use active dry yeast or instant yeast as a substitute.
- Rosewater can be found in specialty stores or online. If you can't find it, you can omit it or use a small amount of vanilla extract instead.
- Canary is a type of sweet fortified wine. If you can't find it, you can use a sweet white wine or even apple juice as a substitute.

## Ingredients:
- 500g all-purpose flour
- 450g currants
- 225g unsalted butter, softened
- 115g granulated sugar
- 7g ground cloves
- 7g ground mace
- 350ml ale-yeast (or substitute)
- 250ml milk
- 60ml Canary wine (or substitute)
- Rosewater, to taste (optional)

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F).

2. In a large mixing bowl, combine the flour, currants, butter, sugar, cloves, and mace. Mix well until the butter is evenly distributed and the mixture resembles coarse crumbs.

3. In a small saucepan, heat the milk until it is just about to boil. Remove from heat and let it cool until it is lukewarm.

4. Once the milk has cooled, add the ale-yeast (or substitute) and rosewater (if using) to the milk. Stir well to combine.

5. Pour the milk mixture into the flour mixture and mix until a dough forms. If the dough is too dry, add a little more milk. If it is too wet, add a little more flour.

6. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead it for a few minutes until it becomes smooth and elastic.

7. Roll out the dough to a thickness of about 1/4 inch. Cut out circles of dough using a round cookie cutter or a glass.

8. Place a spoonful of the currant mixture onto one half of each dough circle. Fold the other half over to form a half-moon shape. Press the edges together to seal.

9. Place the filled cakes onto a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Prick the tops of the cakes with a fork to create steam vents.

10. Bake in the preheated oven for 15-20 minutes, or until the cakes are golden brown.

11. Remove from the oven and let the cakes cool on a wire rack before serving.
