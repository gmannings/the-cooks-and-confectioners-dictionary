# Apple Paste

## Description
Apple paste is a sweet and tangy fruit preserve made from apples. It has a smooth and spreadable consistency, similar to a fruit butter or jam. It can be used as a filling for pastries, spread on toast, or enjoyed on its own.

## Options and commentary
- You can use any variety of apples for this recipe, but tart apples like Granny Smith or Bramley work well.
- If you prefer a smoother texture, you can puree the cooked apples instead of passing them through a hair strainer.
- If you don't have a stove or a stove with a low heat setting, you can use an oven set to a low temperature (around 120Â°C) to dry the apple paste.

## Ingredients:
- 1 kg apples, peeled, cored, and chopped
- Water
- 500 g sugar

## Instructions:
1. Place the peeled, cored, and chopped apples in a large pot and cover them with cold water.
2. Bring the water to a boil over medium heat and cook the apples until they are soft and easily mashed with a fork.
3. Drain the cooked apples and transfer them back to the pot.
4. Use a potato masher or a fork to mash the apples until they are smooth.
5. Pass the mashed apples through a fine-mesh strainer or use a blender to puree them until smooth.
6. Transfer the pureed apples to a skillet and set it over low heat.
7. Stir the pureed apples continuously with a spatula to prevent them from sticking to the bottom of the skillet.
8. Cook the pureed apples on low heat until they start to thicken and come away from the bottom of the skillet. This process may take around 30-40 minutes.
9. Remove the skillet from the heat and add the sugar to the cooked apples.
10. Mix the sugar and apples together until well combined.
11. Line a baking sheet or slate with parchment paper.
12. Spread the apple mixture evenly onto the parchment paper, creating a thin layer.
13. Place the baking sheet or slate in a low-temperature oven or a food dehydrator set to a low heat setting.
14. Dry the apple paste for several hours or until it is firm and no longer sticky to the touch.
15. Once dried, remove the apple paste from the oven or dehydrator and let it cool completely.
16. Cut the apple paste into desired shapes or store it in an airtight container.

## Cooking time
- Cooking the apples: approximately 20 minutes
