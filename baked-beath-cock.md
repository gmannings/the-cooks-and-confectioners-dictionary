# Baked Beath-Cock

## Description
Baked Beath-Cock is a dish made with minced pork mixed with beef suet, herbs, and other ingredients, stuffed into the skin of the bird and then stewed in a flavorful broth. It is a rich and savory dish with a variety of textures and flavors.

## Options and commentary
- Instead of using the skin of the bird, you can use a pork loin or a boneless pork roast as a substitute.
- If you prefer a leaner version, you can use lean ground pork instead of minced pork with beef suet.
- Adjust the seasoning according to your taste preferences.
- The dish can be served with sippets (small pieces of toasted bread) or mashed potatoes.

## Ingredients:
- 1 beath-cock (or substitute with a pork loin or boneless pork roast)
- 200g minced pork
- 100g beef suet
- Salt and pepper to taste
- 1 tablespoon minced fresh herbs (such as parsley, thyme, and rosemary)
- 3 hard-boiled egg yolks, mashed
- 3 artichoke bottoms, boiled and chopped
- 100g roasted and blanched chestnuts, chopped
- 100g boiled marrow, chopped
- 100g boiled skirrets, chopped
- 500ml strong broth (such as beef or chicken broth)
- 1 teaspoon large mace
- 100ml white wine
- 3 boiled artichokes, quartered
- 100g barberries
- 100g grapes, halved
- 2 pears, quartered
- 100g minced meat made into balls
- Sippets or mashed potatoes, for serving
- Slices of lemon and lemon peel, for garnish
- Butter, for brushing
- Hard-boiled egg yolks, mace, and chestnuts, for garnish

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 180Â°C.
2. If using a beath-cock, remove the skin from the bird, leaving the rump, legs, and pinions intact. If using a pork loin or boneless pork roast, skip this step.
3. In a bowl, combine the minced pork, beef suet, salt, pepper, minced herbs, mashed egg yolks, chopped artichoke bottoms, chestnuts, marrow, and skirrets. Mix well to combine.
4. Stuff the mixture into the skin of the beath-cock or into the cavity of the pork loin/roast. If using a beath-cock, prick the skin on the back to secure the stuffing. If using a pork loin/roast, tie it with kitchen twine to secure the stuffing.
5. Place the stuffed beath-cock or pork loin/roast in a deep dish.
6. In a separate saucepan, combine the strong broth, large mace, white wine, quartered boiled artichokes, barberries, grapes, pears, and minced meat balls. Bring to a simmer.
7. Pour the broth mixture over the beath-cock or pork loin/roast in the dish, covering it completely.
8. Cover the dish with another dish or aluminum foil.
9. Place the dish in the preheated oven and bake for approximately 2 hours, or until the meat is cooked through and tender.
10. Remove the dish from the oven and let it rest for a few minutes.
11. Serve the baked beath-cock or sliced pork loin/roast with sippets or mashed potatoes.
12. Garnish with slices of lemon, lemon peel, hard-boiled egg yolks, mace, and chestnuts.
13. Optional: Brush the meat with melted butter for a glossy finish.
