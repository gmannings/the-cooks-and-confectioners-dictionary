# Stewed Smelts

## Description
Stewed Smelts is a dish made with small, delicate fish called smelts. The smelts are cooked in a flavorful mixture of white wine, butter, herbs, and eggs. The dish is served on sippets (small pieces of toasted bread) and garnished with pickled barberries for a tangy and colorful touch.

## Ingredients:
- 500g smelts
- 120ml white wine
- 1/2 teaspoon whole peppercorns
- 1/2 teaspoon dried thyme
- 1/2 teaspoon dried savory
- 115g butter
- 3-4 egg yolks, minced
- Sippets (small pieces of toasted bread)
- Pickled barberries, for garnish

## Instructions:
1. Clean the smelts by removing the heads, tails, and entrails. Rinse them under cold water and pat dry with paper towels.
2. In a deep dish, arrange the smelts in a single layer.
3. Pour the white wine over the smelts.
4. Add the whole peppercorns, dried thyme, and dried savory to the dish.
5. Melt the butter in a small saucepan over low heat.
6. Add the minced egg yolks to the melted butter and stir to combine.
7. Pour the butter and egg yolk mixture over the smelts in the dish.
8. Gently stir the smelts to coat them with the sauce.
9. Cover the dish with a lid or aluminum foil.
10. Place the dish in a preheated oven at 180Â°C and cook for about 15-20 minutes, or until the smelts are cooked through and tender.
11. While the smelts are cooking, prepare the sippets by toasting small pieces of bread until golden brown.
12. Once the smelts are cooked, remove them from the oven.
13. Arrange the smelts on the sippets.
14. Garnish the dish with pickled barberries.
15. Serve the stewed smelts immediately.
