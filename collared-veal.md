# Collared Veal

## Description
Collared veal is a traditional dish where a boneless veal roast is seasoned, rolled, and boiled until tender. It is then served with a creamy white sauce and garnished with sweetbreads and forcemeat balls.

## Ingredients:
- 1 boneless veal roast (approximately 1 kg)
- Salt
- Pepper
- Fresh marjoram
- 50g suet, shredded
- 1/2 tsp ground mace
- 1/2 tsp grated nutmeg
- 50g breadcrumbs
- 100g oysters
- 2 sweetbreads
- Cream
- 2 egg yolks
- Spinach juice (optional)

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 180Â°C.
2. Remove the bones from the veal roast and set them aside.
3. In a mortar, pound together salt, pepper, fresh marjoram, shredded suet, ground mace, grated nutmeg, breadcrumbs, and oysters until well combined.
4. Spread the mixture evenly over the veal roast.
5. Roll up the veal roast tightly to form a collar shape.
6. Wrap the rolled veal roast in a clean cloth and tie it securely with kitchen twine.
7. Place the wrapped veal roast in a large pot and fill it with enough water to cover the roast.
8. Bring the water to a boil over high heat, then reduce the heat to low and simmer for three hours.
9. While the veal is boiling, prepare the sauce. Start by boiling the veal bones in a separate pot to make a flavorful gravy.
10. In a saucepan, combine the gravy with cream and egg yolks. Cook over low heat, stirring constantly, until the sauce thickens.
11. If desired, add spinach juice to a portion of the stuffing mixture and shape it into small balls.
12. Fry the sweetbreads in a separate pan until golden brown.
13. Once the veal is cooked, remove it from the pot and unwrap it from the cloth.
14. Slice the collared veal into thick slices and serve with the creamy sauce, fried sweetbreads, and the spinach-flavored forcemeat balls as garnish.
