# Beef with Marrow and Spinach

## Description
This recipe is a modernized version of an 18th-century dish made with beef, marrow, breadcrumbs, eggs, spinach, and various spices. The beef is mixed with the marrow, breadcrumbs, eggs, spinach, and spices, then formed into balls and rolls. It is a flavorful and hearty dish that can be served as a main course.

## Options and commentary
- You can use any cut of beef that is suitable for braising or slow cooking.
- If marrow is not available, you can substitute it with butter or olive oil.
- Instead of white bread crumbs, you can use panko breadcrumbs or finely crushed crackers.
- Thyme and savory are traditional herbs used in this recipe, but you can use any herbs you prefer.
- For the spices, you can use salt, pepper, cloves, and mace, or adjust the spices to your taste.
- Scalding the spinach helps to remove any bitterness and soften the leaves. If you prefer, you can blanch the spinach instead.
- You can shape the mixture into balls or rolls, or even try other shapes like patties or meatballs.
