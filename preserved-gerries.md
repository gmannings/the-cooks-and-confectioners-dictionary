# Preserved Gerries

## Description
This recipe is for preserving gerries (presumably berries) in a sweet syrup. The gerries are first boiled in a sugar syrup until they become translucent, then drained and coated in a pearl-like sugar syrup. Finally, a syrup made from currants is added to give the gerries a nice color. The preserved gerries can be stored in pots for future use.

## Ingredients:
- Gerries (berries)
- Sugar
- Syrup of currants

## Instructions:
1. Cut off the stalks of the gerries.
2. In a pan, prepare a sugar syrup boiled to the third degree, also known as "blown" stage. This means the syrup should reach a temperature of around 112-116째C (234-241째F).
3. Add the gerries to the sugar syrup and let them boil, covered, for ten to twelve times. This means you should bring the syrup to a boil, then let it cool slightly before bringing it to a boil again. Repeat this process ten to twelve times.
4. Let the gerries cool in the syrup overnight.
5. Drain the gerries from the syrup.
6. In a separate pan, prepare a sugar syrup boiled until it becomes pearl-like. This means the syrup should reach a temperature of around 110-112째C (230-234째F).
7. Coat the drained gerries in the pearl-like sugar syrup.
8. Prepare a syrup using currants of the same quality as the sugar syrup. This can be done by boiling currants with sugar until it reaches a syrup consistency.
9. Add the currant syrup to the coated gerries to give them a fine color.
10. Transfer the preserved gerries into pots for storage.
