# Hasty Pudding

## Description
Hasty Pudding is a traditional English dish made from cornmeal or wheat flour cooked in milk or water. It is a simple and comforting dish that can be enjoyed as a breakfast porridge or a dessert.

## Options and commentary
- You can use either cornmeal or wheat flour for this recipe, depending on your preference.
- You can sweeten the pudding with sugar or honey, and flavor it with spices like cinnamon or nutmeg.
- You can serve the pudding plain, or top it with fruits, nuts, or a drizzle of syrup for added flavor.

## Ingredients:
- 1 cup cornmeal or wheat flour
- 4 cups milk
- 1/4 cup sugar or honey (optional)
- 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon or nutmeg (optional)
- Toppings of your choice (e.g. fruits, nuts, syrup)

## Instructions:
1. In a large saucepan, bring the milk to a simmer over medium heat.
2. In a separate bowl, whisk together the cornmeal or wheat flour with a little bit of cold water to form a smooth paste.
3. Slowly pour the cornmeal or wheat flour mixture into the simmering milk, stirring constantly to prevent lumps from forming.

6. Remove the saucepan from heat and let the pudding cool slightly before serving.
