# Artichokes in Oil and Vinegar

## Description
This recipe is a modernized version of an 18th-century recipe for artichokes. The artichokes are boiled until tender, then the bottoms are cut out and marinated in a mixture of salt, pepper, vinegar, cloves, bay leaves, and oil or butter. The result is a flavorful and tangy dish that can be served as an appetizer or a side dish.

## Ingredients:
- 4 artichokes
- Salt
- Pepper
- 1/4 cup vinegar
- 4 cloves
- 2 bay leaves
- 1/4 cup olive oil or melted butter

## Instructions:
1. Fill a large bowl with water and add a generous amount of salt. Place the artichokes in the salted water and let them soak for at least 12 hours, or overnight. This will help remove any bitterness from the artichokes.
2. Drain the artichokes and rinse them under cold water.
3. Fill a large pot with water and bring it to a boil. Add a pinch of salt to the boiling water.
4. Carefully place the artichokes in the boiling water and cook them for about 30-40 minutes, or until the leaves can be easily pulled from the bottoms.
5. Remove the artichokes from the pot and let them cool slightly.
6. Once the artichokes are cool enough to handle, cut off the bottoms of the artichokes, removing any tough outer leaves.
7. In a separate pot, combine the vinegar, cloves, bay leaves, salt, and pepper. Bring the mixture to a simmer over medium heat and let it cook for about 5 minutes.
8. Place the artichoke bottoms in a clean, sterilized jar or container. Pour the vinegar mixture over the artichokes, making sure they are fully submerged.
9. Let the artichokes marinate in the vinegar mixture for at least 24 hours in the refrigerator.
10. After marinating, remove the artichokes from the vinegar mixture and drain them well.
11. Place the artichokes in a clean jar or container and pour the olive oil or melted butter over them, making sure they are fully covered.
12. Seal the jar or container and refrigerate for at least 24 hours before serving.
13. Serve the artichokes as an appetizer or a side dish. They can be enjoyed cold or at room temperature.
