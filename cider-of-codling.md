# Cider of Codling

## Description
Cider of Codling is a refreshing and slightly tart apple cider that is perfect for enjoying during the summer months. It is made from ripe codling apples that are crushed and their juice is fermented to create a delicious beverage.

## Ingredients:
- 2 kg codling apples
- Hay or straw
- Sugar (1 lump per bottle)

## Instructions:
1. Gather the codling apples when they begin to be ripe.
2. Lay the apples in hay or straw for three to four days to sweat. This helps to develop their flavors.
3. Quarter and core the apples.
4. Grind or stamp the apples to extract their juice. You can use a juicer or a food processor for this step.
5. Press the juice out of the apples through a fine-mesh bag or cheesecloth.
6. Let the juice stand for 24 hours to allow any sediment to settle at the bottom.
7. Carefully transfer the clear juice into another clean cask, leaving behind any sediment.
8. Let the juice ferment in the cask for two weeks. This will allow the natural sugars in the juice to convert into alcohol.
9. After two weeks, bottle the cider. Add a lump of sugar to each bottle to provide a touch of sweetness.
10. Leave the bottles uncorked for 24 hours to allow any remaining fermentation gases to escape.
11. Cork the bottles tightly and let them age for 10 days. During this time, the flavors will continue to develop.
12. After 10 days, the cider will be ready to drink. Serve chilled and enjoy!
