# Jelly of Gooseberries

## Description
This recipe is for making a sweet and tangy jelly using gooseberries. The gooseberries are bruised and the pulp is strained to remove any seeds or skins. The pulp is then boiled with sugar until it reaches a thick consistency. The resulting jelly can be used as a spread or as a topping for desserts.

## Ingredients:
- Gooseberries
- Double refined sugar

## Instructions:
1. Wash the gooseberries thoroughly and remove any stems or leaves.
2. Place the gooseberries in a large bowl and use a masher or the back of a spoon to bruise them. This will help release the pulp.
3. Set up a cloth or sieve over another bowl or pot. Pour the bruised gooseberries into the cloth or sieve and press down firmly to extract the pulp. Discard any seeds or skins that remain in the cloth or sieve.
4. Measure the amount of pulp obtained and calculate three quarters of a pint of sugar for every pint of pulp.
5. In a large pot, combine the gooseberry pulp and the calculated amount of double refined sugar.
6. Place the pot over medium heat and bring the mixture to a boil, stirring constantly to dissolve the sugar.
7. Once the mixture reaches a boil, reduce the heat to low and simmer gently, stirring occasionally, until the mixture thickens. To test the consistency, place a small amount of the jelly on a plate and allow it to cool. If it doesn't stick to the plate, the jelly is ready.
8. Remove the pot from the heat and let the jelly cool slightly.
9. Set up a clean cloth or sieve over another bowl or pot. Pour the jelly into the cloth or sieve and press down gently to strain out any remaining solids.
10. Transfer the strained jelly into sterilized jars and seal tightly.
11. Allow the jelly to cool completely before storing it in the refrigerator.
