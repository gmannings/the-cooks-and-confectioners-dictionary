# Roasted Pullets with Onions

## Description
This recipe is for roasted pullets (young chickens) stuffed with bacon and herbs, and served with simmered onions and a ham essence sauce. It is a flavorful and hearty dish that can be enjoyed as a main course.

## Ingredients:
- 2 pullets (young chickens)
- 100g bacon, scraped and minced
- Fresh herbs (such as parsley, thyme, and rosemary), minced
- 8 slices of bacon
- 4 onions
- 500ml water
- 250ml veal stock
- 100ml ham stock

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 180°C.
2. Raise the skin from the flesh of the breasts of the pullets, being careful not to tear it. 
3. Stuff the cavity between the skin and flesh with the minced bacon and herbs.
4. Tie up the rumps and necks of the pullets with kitchen twine to secure the stuffing.
5. Parboil the pullets by placing them in a pot of boiling water for 5 minutes. 
6. Remove the pullets from the pot and pat them dry with paper towels.
7. Wrap each pullet with 4 slices of bacon, securing them with toothpicks if needed.
8. Place the wrapped pullets on a roasting rack in a roasting pan.
9. Roast the pullets in the preheated oven for about 1 hour, or until the internal temperature reaches 75°C.
10. While the pullets are roasting, prepare the onions. Peel off the outer peels of the onions and cut off the tops and bottoms.
11. In a saucepan, bring the water to a simmer and add the peeled onions. Cook the onions over low heat for about 30 minutes, or until they are tender.
12. In a separate saucepan, combine the veal stock and ham stock. Bring the mixture to a simmer and let it reduce by half.
13. Once the pullets are roasted, remove them from the oven and let them rest for a few minutes.
14. Slice the pullets and arrange them on a serving platter.
15. Drain the cooked onions and arrange them around the sliced pullets in a ring.
16. Pour the reduced veal and ham stock over the onions.
17. Serve the roasted pullets with onions hot.

## Cooking time
Approximately 1 hour for roasting the pullets, plus additional time for preparation and simmering the onions.
