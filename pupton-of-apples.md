## Ingredients:
- 4-5 apples
- 100g sugar
- 1 tsp cinnamon
- 4-5 egg yolks
- 1 handful of bread crumbs
- 50g butter
- Stewed pears or cherries (optional)

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F).
2. Peel, core, and chop the apples into small pieces.
3. In a saucepan, combine the chopped apples, sugar, and cinnamon. Cook over medium heat until the apples are soft and have turned into a marmalade-like consistency. Stir occasionally to prevent burning.
4. Remove the saucepan from heat and let the apple marmalade cool slightly.
5. In a separate bowl, whisk the egg yolks until well beaten.
6. Add the beaten egg yolks, grated bread crumbs, and butter to the apple marmalade. Mix well to combine all the ingredients.
7. If desired, add stewed pears or cherries to the mixture and gently fold them in.
8. Grease a tart pan or baking dish with butter.
9. Pour the apple mixture into the prepared tart pan or baking dish, spreading it evenly.
10. Place the tart pan or baking dish in the preheated oven and bake for approximately 30-40 minutes, or until the top is golden brown and the tart is set.
11. Remove the tart from the oven and let it cool for a few minutes.
12. Carefully invert the tart onto a serving plate, so the bottom becomes the top.
13. Serve the Pupton of Apples as a second course, either warm or at room temperature.
