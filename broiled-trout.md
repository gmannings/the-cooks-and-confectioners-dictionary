# Broiled Trout

## Description
This recipe is for broiled trout, a simple and delicious dish. The trout is gutted, washed, and dried before being tied with a string. It is then sprinkled with melted butter and salt and cooked on a gridiron over a gentle fire. The trout is turned often to ensure even cooking. A flavorful sauce is made with butter, salt, pepper, nutmeg, flour, vinegar, water, anchovy, and capers. The sauce is thickened on the stovetop and then poured over the cooked trout before serving. 

## Options and commentary
- You can serve the broiled trout with a ragout of cucumbers or mushrooms for added flavor and variety.
- If you prefer a richer sauce, you can bind it with a crayfish cullis instead of using capers.

## Ingredients:
- 2 trout
- 2 tablespoons melted butter
- Salt
- Pepper
- Nutmeg
- 1 tablespoon flour
- 1 tablespoon vinegar
- 1/4 cup water
- 1 anchovy
- 1 tablespoon capers (optional)
- Ragout of cucumbers or mushrooms (optional)
- Crayfish cullis (optional)

## Instructions:
1. Gut the trout and rinse them under cold water. Pat them dry with a clean cloth.
2. Tie each trout with a piece of kitchen twine to help them hold their shape during cooking.
3. Sprinkle the trout with melted butter and season with salt and pepper.
4. Preheat a grill or broiler to medium heat.
5. Place the trout on a greased grill or broiler pan and cook for about 5-7 minutes per side, or until the flesh is opaque and flakes easily with a fork. Turn the trout occasionally to ensure even cooking.
6. While the trout is cooking, prepare the sauce. In a saucepan, melt the butter over medium heat. Add the flour and cook for 1-2 minutes, stirring constantly.
7. Gradually whisk in the vinegar, water, and nutmeg. Add the anchovy and capers (if using). Continue cooking and stirring until the sauce thickens to your desired consistency.
8. Remove the cooked trout from the grill or broiler and transfer them to a serving platter.
9. Pour the sauce over the trout, ensuring that each fish is well coated.
10. Serve the broiled trout with a side of ragout of cucumbers or mushrooms, if desired. Alternatively, you can bind the sauce with a crayfish cullis instead of using capers.
