# Preserved Apples

## Description
Preserved apples are a sweet and tangy treat that can be enjoyed on their own or used in various desserts and baked goods.

## Options and commentary
- You can use any small variety of apples for this recipe, such as Granny Smith or Gala.
- If you prefer a sweeter taste, you can add some spices like cinnamon or nutmeg to the syrup.
- The cooking time may vary depending on the size and ripeness of the apples.

## Ingredients:
- Small apples
- Sugar
- Water

## Instructions:
1. Wash and peel the small apples, leaving the stalks intact.
2. Make a small slit in each apple to help them absorb the sugar.
3. Place the apples in a pot of water and bring it to a boil. Let them simmer for a few minutes until they become slightly tender.
4. Remove the apples from the pot and let them cool.
5. Fill another pot with fresh water and bring it to a boil. Add the cooled apples to the boiling water and let them cook until they turn a vibrant green color. This may take a few minutes.
6. Once the apples have softened, remove them from the pot and let them cool again.
7. Drain the apples and set them aside.
8. In a separate pot, prepare a sugar syrup by combining sugar and water. Heat the mixture until the sugar has dissolved completely.
9. The next day, bring the syrup to a smooth boil. This means that it should be gently bubbling but not vigorously boiling.
10. On the following day, increase the heat slightly and boil the syrup until it reaches a "pearl" consistency. This means that the syrup will form small pearls when dropped into cold water.
11. The next day, continue boiling the syrup until it becomes very thick and forms large pearls.
12. Immediately add the drained apples to the syrup and let them simmer together for some time. This will allow the apples to absorb the sweet syrup.
13. The next day, cover the pot and boil the apples and syrup together for a short period of time.
14. Transfer the preserved apples into clean, sterilized jars and let them cool.
15. Drain any excess syrup from the jars and place the apples on a drying rack or a stove to dry completely.

## Cooking time
Approximately 3-4 days, including resting and cooling times.
