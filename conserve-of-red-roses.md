# Conserve of Red Roses

## Description
Conserve of Red Roses is a sweet and fragrant preserve made from fresh red roses and sugar. It is a traditional recipe from the 18th century that was used to capture the essence of roses and enjoy their flavor throughout the year.

## Ingredients:
- Fresh red roses (gathered before fully bloomed)
- Double-refined sugar (twice the weight of the roses)

## Instructions:
1. Gather the red roses when they are still in bud form, before they fully bloom.
2. Remove the petals from the roses and discard the stems and any green parts.
3. Pound the rose petals in a stone mortar until they form a paste-like consistency.
4. Weigh the pounded rose petals and measure out double the weight in double-refined sugar.
5. In a clean glass jar with a tight-fitting lid, layer the pounded rose petals and sugar, starting with a layer of sugar at the bottom.
6. Continue layering the rose petals and sugar until the jar is filled, leaving some space at the top.
7. Close the jar tightly with the lid.
8. Place the jar in a cool, dark place and let it stand for three months. During this time, remember to stir the mixture once a day to ensure the sugar is evenly distributed and dissolved.
9. After three months, the conserve of red roses is ready to be used.
