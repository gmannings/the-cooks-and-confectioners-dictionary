# Stuffed Pike with Oysters and Shrimp

## Description
This recipe is for a stuffed pike, a type of fish, that is flavored with oysters, shrimp, and various spices. The pike is stuffed with a mixture of oysters, shrimp, anchovies, onion, spices, and butter, then roasted on a spit. It is served with a flavorful sauce made from claret wine, oyster liquor, butter, anchovy, spices, vinegar, and flour.

## Ingredients:
- 1 large pike
- 1 pint of oysters or shrimp
- 3-4 anchovies
- 1 onion or shallot
- Nutmeg
- Cloves
- Mace
- Parsley
- Butter
- Claret wine
- Vinegar
- Flour

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F).
2. Clean the pike by removing the innards and washing it thoroughly.
3. In a bowl, combine the oysters or shrimp, finely chopped anchovies, finely chopped onion or shallot, a pinch of grated nutmeg, a pinch of cloves, a pinch of mace, and some chopped parsley.
4. Mix the ingredients well and add a small amount of butter to bind the mixture together.
5. Stuff the belly of the pike with the mixture, ensuring it is evenly distributed.
6. Sprinkle some of the mixture on the outside of the pike as well.
7. Secure the pike on a spit and place it in the preheated oven.
8. Baste the pike with either butter or claret wine every 15 minutes to keep it moist.
9. While the pike is roasting, prepare the sauce. In a saucepan, combine claret wine, some of the oyster liquor, a knob of butter, a finely chopped anchovy, a pinch of spices, a splash of vinegar, and a little flour to thicken.
10. Cook the sauce over low heat, stirring constantly, until it thickens to your desired consistency.
11. Once the pike is cooked through and golden brown, remove it from the oven and let it rest for a few minutes.
12. Serve the stuffed pike with the claret wine sauce on the side.

## Cooking time
Approximately 1 hour, depending on the size of the pike.
