# Chort Rolls

## Description
Chort Rolls are a type of sweet bread roll that originated in the 18th century. They are made with a mixture of flour, butter, sugar, spices, and yeast, and are flavored with coriander seeds. The dough is then enriched with Canary wine and milk. The rolls are baked until golden brown and can be enjoyed warm or cold.

## Ingredients:
- 500g fine flour
- 340g unsalted butter, cold and cut into small pieces
- 1/2 tsp salt
- 50g sugar
- 1 tsp mixed spices (such as cinnamon, nutmeg, and cloves)
- 1 tbsp coriander seeds, crushed
- 120ml ale yeast
- 120ml warm Canary wine (or any sweet white wine)
- 120ml warm milk

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F).
2. In a large mixing bowl, combine the flour, butter, salt, sugar, mixed spices, and crushed coriander seeds.
3. Rub the butter into the flour mixture using your fingertips until it resembles coarse breadcrumbs.
4. In a separate small bowl, mix together the ale yeast, warm Canary wine, and warm milk.
5. Make a well in the center of the flour mixture and pour in the yeast mixture.
6. Stir the ingredients together until a dough forms.
7. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead for about 5 minutes until smooth and elastic.
8. Place the dough back into the mixing bowl, cover with a warm cloth, and let it rise in a warm place for about 1 hour or until doubled in size.
9. Once the dough has risen, punch it down to release any air bubbles.
10. Divide the dough into small portions and shape them into rolls.
11. Place the rolls onto a baking sheet lined with parchment paper, leaving some space between each roll.
12. Prick the tops of the rolls with a fork to prevent them from puffing up too much during baking.
13. Bake in the preheated oven for about 20-25 minutes or until the rolls are golden brown.
14. Remove the rolls from the oven and transfer them to a wire rack to cool.
15. Cover the rolls with a clean cloth until they are completely cooled.
