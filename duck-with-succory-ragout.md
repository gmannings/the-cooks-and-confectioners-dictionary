# Duck with Succory Ragout

## Description
This recipe is a modernized version of an 18th-century dish called "Duck with Succozy." It features a roasted duck served with a succory ragout. Succory, also known as chicory, is a bitter leafy green that adds a unique flavor to the dish. The duck is first braised and then served with a rich gravy and succory ragout.

## Options and commentary
- You can use either a whole duck or duck breasts for this recipe, depending on your preference.
- If succory is not available, you can substitute it with other bitter greens like arugula or endive.
- To save time, you can use store-bought gravy instead of making it from scratch.

## Ingredients:
- 1 whole duck or duck breasts
- Salt and pepper, to taste
- 2 cups chicken or vegetable broth
- 1 cup red wine
- 2 tablespoons butter
- 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
- 1 cup diced veal
- 1 cup diced ham
- 2 cups succory (chicory), washed and chopped

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F).
2. Season the duck with salt and pepper.
3. Place the duck in a roasting pan and roast in the preheated oven for about 1.5 to 2 hours, or until the internal temperature reaches 75°C (165°F) for the breasts or 82°C (180°F) for the whole duck.
4. While the duck is roasting, prepare the succory ragout. In a saucepan, bring the chicken or vegetable broth to a boil.
5. Add the succory to the boiling broth and cook for 5 minutes. Drain the succory and set aside.
6. In a separate saucepan, melt the butter over medium heat. Add the diced veal and ham and cook until browned.
7. Sprinkle the flour over the meat and stir well to combine. Cook for 2 minutes to cook off the raw flour taste.
8. Slowly pour in the red wine, stirring constantly to avoid lumps. Cook for another 2 minutes to allow the alcohol to evaporate.
9. Gradually add the reserved broth from cooking the succory, stirring constantly, until the sauce thickens to your desired consistency.
10. Add the cooked succory to the sauce and simmer for an additional 5 minutes to allow the flavors to meld together.
11. Once the duck is cooked, remove it from the oven and let it rest for 10 minutes before carving.
12. Carve the duck into serving portions and arrange on a serving platter.
13. Pour the succory ragout over the duck and serve immediately.
