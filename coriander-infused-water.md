# Coriander-Infused Water

## Description
Coriander-infused water is a refreshing and aromatic beverage made by infusing coriander seeds in water. The infusion process allows the flavors of the coriander to infuse into the water, creating a subtly sweet and herbal drink.

- 115 grams of sugar

## Instructions:
1. Remove the husks from the coriander seeds, ensuring that only the seeds remain.
2. In a large pot, combine the coriander seeds, water, and sugar.
3. Allow the mixture to infuse for two to three hours, allowing the flavors to meld together.
4. After the infusion period, carefully pour the liquid from one pot to another, straining out the coriander seeds.
5. Transfer the strained coriander-infused water into a clean container for storage.
6. Refrigerate the coriander-infused water until chilled.
7. Serve the coriander-infused water over ice, garnished with fresh coriander leaves if desired.
