# Fouced Capon

## Description
Fouced Capon is a dish made with a whole capon (a castrated rooster) that is first boiled with veal and aromatic spices, then served in a jelly-like broth made from the cooking liquid and white wine. It is garnished with barberries, lemon slices, and spices.

## Ingredients:
- 1 whole capon
- 1 knuckle of veal, jointed
- 1 gallon (3.8 liters) of water
- 5-6 blades of mace
- 2-3 slices of ginger
- 3 fennel roots
- 3 parsley roots
- 1 quart (946 ml) of white wine
- 3 lemons, sliced
- Barberries, for garnish
- Nutmeg, for garnish
- Additional mace, for garnish

## Instructions:
1. Prepare the capon by cleaning and removing any excess fat or giblets. 
2. Place the capon and the jointed veal knuckle in a large pot or Dutch oven. 
3. Fill the pot with water and bring it to a boil over high heat. 
4. Skim off any impurities or foam that rise to the surface of the water. 
5. Add the blades of mace, sliced ginger, fennel roots, and parsley roots to the pot. 
6. Reduce the heat to low and let the capon and veal simmer for about 2-3 hours, or until they are fully cooked and tender. 
7. Remove the capon from the pot and set it aside. 
8. Strain the cooking liquid through a fine-mesh sieve to remove any solids. 
9. Return the strained liquid to the pot and add the white wine. 
10. Bring the liquid to a boil and let it simmer until it reduces and thickens to a jelly-like consistency. This may take about 1-2 hours. 
11. Once the liquid has thickened, remove it from the heat and transfer it to an earthenware pan or dish. 
12. Place the capon back into the dish with the thickened liquid. 
13. Add the sliced lemons to the dish, arranging them around the capon. 
14. Cover the dish tightly and refrigerate it for at least 4 hours, or until the jelly has set. 
15. When ready to serve, garnish the fouced capon with barberries, lemon slices, grated nutmeg, and additional blades of mace.
