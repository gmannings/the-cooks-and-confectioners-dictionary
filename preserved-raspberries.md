# Preserved Raspberries

## Description
This recipe provides instructions for preserving raspberries. It recommends using raspberries with small grains, as they have a firmer texture. Raspberries grown in dry soil are preferred over those grown in moist places. The recipe also suggests using less sugar than usual, as fruits from marshy grounds dissolve in sugar. If the raspberries are slightly green or tart, it is advised not to boil them in sugar initially, as they may become hard.

## Ingredients:
- 4 pounds raspberries
- 3 pounds pearl sugar (granulated sugar can be used as a modern alternative)

## Instructions:
1. Pick four pounds of raspberries, ensuring they have small grains and are not overly juicy.
2. Lightly boil the raspberries in a pot, covered, with three pounds of pearl sugar (or granulated sugar) for a short period of time. Stir occasionally.
3. Allow the mixture to cool, then remove the raspberries from the syrup and drain them.
4. Dry the raspberries thoroughly.
5. Return the raspberries to the syrup, adding more pearl sugar to ensure there is enough syrup to cover the fruit.
6. Transfer the raspberries and syrup into glass jars for storage.

## Cooking time
Approximately 1 hour (including boiling and cooling time)
