# Rice Flozendine

## Description
Rice Flozendine is a rich and indulgent baked rice pudding dish. It is made with cooked rice, eggs, butter, currants, cream, and various spices. The mixture is then baked in a pastry crust until golden and delicious.

## Options and commentary
- You can use either marrow or butter in this recipe. Marrow was commonly used in the 18th century, but butter is a more readily available and familiar ingredient today.
- Currants can be substituted with raisins or other dried fruits of your choice.
- Canary refers to Canary wine, a type of fortified wine. You can substitute it with a sweet white wine or omit it altogether.
- Role-water is a type of distilled water flavored with rose petals. You can substitute it with rose water or omit it if you don't have it.
- Puff pastry can be used to cover the pudding, or you can create a decorative pattern on top using strips of pastry and lozenges.

## Ingredients:
- 250g rice
- Water
- Milk
- 3 egg yolks
- 2 egg whites
- 115g butter or marrow
- 115g currants
- 60ml cream
- 1-2 tablespoons sweet white wine (optional)
- 1-2 tablespoons rose water (optional)
- Salt
- Nutmeg
- Cinnamon
- Cloves
- Mace
- 60g candied citron and lemon peel
- Puff pastry
- Sugar for sprinkling

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F).
2. In a large saucepan, bring water to a boil and add the rice. Cook the rice until it is tender. Drain the rice and return it to the saucepan.
3. Pour milk into the saucepan with the cooked rice, enough to make it thick like a hefty pudding. Cook the rice in the milk over low heat, stirring constantly, until it reaches the desired consistency. Remove from heat and let it cool.
4. In a separate bowl, beat the egg yolks and egg whites together.
5. Add the beaten eggs, butter or marrow, currants, cream, sweet white wine (if using), rose water (if using), salt, nutmeg, cinnamon, cloves, mace, and candied citron and lemon peel to the cooled rice mixture. Stir well to combine.
6. Roll out the puff pastry and use it to line a baking dish or pie dish. Pour the rice mixture into the pastry-lined dish.
7. If desired, create a decorative pattern on top of the rice mixture using strips of pastry and lozenges.
8. Sprinkle sugar over the top of the pastry.
9. Bake in the preheated oven for approximately 45-50 minutes, or until the pastry is golden brown and the pudding is set.
10. Remove from the oven and let it cool slightly before serving.
