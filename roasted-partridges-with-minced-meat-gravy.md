# Roasted Partridges with Minced Meat Gravy

## Description
This recipe is a modernized version of an 18th-century dish called "Dzels Partridges a Biberot." It features roasted partridges served with a flavorful minced meat gravy. The dish is rich and hearty, perfect for a special occasion or a fancy dinner.

## Options and commentary
- Instead of partridges, you can use chicken breasts or any other game bird of your choice.
- If you prefer a thicker gravy, you can add a roux (equal parts flour and butter) to the minced meat mixture.
- The chippings of bread mentioned in the original recipe can be replaced with breadcrumbs for a crispy topping.

## Ingredients:
- 2 partridges (or chicken breasts)
- 2 fat pullets (optional, for additional meat)
- Flour, for dusting
- Salt and pepper, to taste
- 1 tablespoon vegetable oil
- 1 tablespoon butter
- 1 onion, finely chopped
- 2 cloves of garlic, minced
- 1 cup chicken or beef broth
- 1 tablespoon minced fresh herbs (such as thyme, rosemary, or parsley)
- 1 tablespoon gammon essence (or substitute with bacon or ham stock)
- Breadcrumbs, for garnish (optional)

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F).
2. Season the partridges (or chicken breasts) with salt and pepper. 
3. In a large skillet, heat the vegetable oil over medium-high heat. Add the partridges and cook until browned on all sides. 
4. Transfer the partridges to a roasting pan and roast in the preheated oven for about 20-25 minutes, or until cooked through. Remove from the oven and let them rest for a few minutes.
5. While the partridges are roasting, prepare the minced meat gravy. 
6. In the same skillet used to cook the partridges, melt the butter over medium heat. Add the chopped onion and minced garlic and sauté until softened and lightly browned.
7. Add the minced meat (from the partridge carcasses and/or roasted pullets) to the skillet and cook until browned and cooked through.
8. Pour in the chicken or beef broth and stir well to combine. Simmer for about 10 minutes to allow the flavors to meld together.
9. Strain the mixture through a sieve to remove any solids, then return the liquid to the skillet.
10. Stir in the minced fresh herbs and gammon essence. Cook for an additional 5 minutes, or until the gravy has thickened slightly.
11. Remove the partridges from the roasting pan and slice the meat off their breasts. If needed, you can also use the roasted pullets' breasts for additional meat.
12. Place the sliced partridge meat into the skillet with the gravy and gently stir to coat the meat.
13. Let the meat and gravy mixture simmer over low heat for a few minutes, making sure it doesn't stick to the bottom of the skillet.
14. Once the meat is heated through and the flavors have melded together, transfer the dish to serving plates.
15. Optional: If desired, sprinkle breadcrumbs over the top of the dish and use a kitchen torch or a hot iron to brown the breadcrumbs.
16. Serve the roasted partridges with minced meat gravy hot, and enjoy with a spoon or fork.
