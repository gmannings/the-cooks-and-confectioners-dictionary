# Fried Artichokes

## Description
This recipe is for crispy and flavorful fried artichoke slices. The artichokes are blanched, marinated in vinegar, dipped in beaten eggs, coated in flour, and then fried until golden brown. They are served with fried parsley for added flavor.

## Ingredients:
- 4 artichokes
- Vinegar
- Pepper
- Salt
- 2 eggs
- Flour
- Hog's lard or clarified butter
- Fresh parsley

## Instructions:
1. Prepare the artichokes by removing the chokes and cutting them into slices.
2. Bring a pot of water to a boil and blanch the artichoke slices for about 4-5 minutes. This will help soften them.
3. Remove the artichoke slices from the boiling water and transfer them to a bowl.
4. Add vinegar, pepper, and salt to the bowl with the artichokes. Let them steep in the marinade for about 15 minutes.
5. In a separate bowl, beat the eggs.
6. Take each artichoke slice from the marinade and dip it into the beaten eggs, ensuring it is well coated.
7. Coat the egg-dipped artichoke slices in flour, making sure they are evenly coated.
8. Heat hog's lard or clarified butter in a frying pan over medium heat.
9. Fry the coated artichoke slices in the hot lard or butter until they turn golden brown and crispy. This should take about 2-3 minutes per side.
10. Remove the fried artichoke slices from the pan and place them on a paper towel-lined plate to drain excess oil.
11. In the same pan, fry some fresh parsley until it becomes crispy.
12. Serve the fried artichoke slices with the fried parsley as a garnish.
