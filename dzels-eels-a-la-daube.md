# Dzels Eels a la daube

## Description
Dzels Eels a la daube is a traditional 18th-century dish made with eels and tench. The eel and tench flesh is minced and seasoned with salt, pepper, nutmeg, and cloves. The minced meat is then layered with small pieces of eel flesh, forming a brick-loaf shape. The loaf is wrapped in a linen cloth and stewed in a mixture of water and claret, seasoned with pepper, bay leaf, and cloves. After cooling, the loaf is sliced and served in plates or small dishes.

## Ingredients:
- 2 eels
