## Description
Dr. Twin's Almond Milk is a sweet and creamy beverage made with almond milk and flavored with various herbs and fruits. It is a refreshing and nutritious drink that can be enjoyed on its own or used as a base for other recipes.

## Options and commentary
- Instead of boiling the water and letting it stand, you can use filtered water to ensure clarity.
- If you don't have access to fresh strawberry plants, you can use strawberry leaves and roots that are available in herbal stores.
- Violet leaves can be substituted with other edible flowers like rose petals or lavender.
- Sorrel root can be replaced with sorrel leaves if the root is not available.
- Instead of raifins of the sun, you can use regular raisins.
- Pompion kernels are pumpkin seeds, which can be found in most grocery stores.
- Almonds can be blanched and beaten manually or purchased as almond meal or almond flour.
- Adjust the amount of sugar according to your taste preference.
