# Gooseberry Tansey

## Description
Gooseberry Tansey is a traditional 18th-century recipe made with ripe gooseberries and sugar. It is a sweet and tangy fruit drink that can be enjoyed on its own or used as a base for cocktails.

## Options and commentary
- You can adjust the amount of sugar according to your taste preference.
- If fresh gooseberries are not available, you can use frozen gooseberries instead.

## Ingredients:
- 16 pounds of ripe gooseberries
- 1 gallon of water
- 16 pounds of sugar

## Instructions:
1. Wash the gooseberries thoroughly and remove any stems or leaves.
2. In a large pot, combine the gooseberries and water. Use a masher or the back of a spoon to crush the gooseberries well in the water.
3. Let the mixture stand for two days, stirring it two or three times a day.
4. After two days, strain the mixture through a fine-mesh sieve or a hair bag to remove any solids.
5. Measure the strained liquid and for every quart of liquid, add 1 pound of sugar. Mix well until the sugar is dissolved.
6. Cover the mixture and let it stand for some time to allow the flavors to meld together.
7. Strain the mixture once again, this time through a flannel bag or a cheesecloth-lined sieve, into a cask or a large container.
8. Let the mixture ferment for two months, ensuring that it is tightly sealed.
9. After two months, if the mixture is clear and free from sediment, it is ready to be bottled.
10. Transfer the gooseberry tansey into clean, sterilized bottles and seal them tightly.

## Cooking time
2 months (including fermentation time)
