# French-style Boiled Pike

## Description
This recipe is for a French-style boiled pike. The pike is split down the back while still alive and then cooked in a mixture of water, salt, and claret wine. It is flavored with onions, spices, and lemon, and served with sippets (small pieces of toasted bread) and grated manchet (fine breadcrumbs).

## Options and commentary
- Instead of using a whole pike, you can use pike fillets or any other firm white fish.
- If you don't have claret wine, you can use any dry red wine.
- Sippets can be made by toasting small slices of bread or using croutons.
- Manchet can be substituted with regular breadcrumbs or omitted if desired.

## Ingredients:
- 1 whole pike (or pike fillets)
- Water
- Salt
- 500 ml claret wine (or any dry red wine)
- 3-4 onions, sliced
- Salt
- Coarsely ground black pepper
- 3-4 blades of mace
- Slices of lemon, for garnish
- Lemon peel, for garnish
- Butter, beaten
- Grated manchet (fine breadcrumbs), for garnish

## Instructions:
1. Fill a large pot with water and add salt. Bring the water to a boil.
2. While the water is boiling, prepare the pike. Split the pike down the back while it is still alive.
3. Carefully remove the pike from the water and clean it to remove any blood.
4. In a stew-pan, pour in enough claret wine to cover the pike.
5. Add the sliced onions, salt, coarsely ground black pepper, and blades of mace to the stew-pan.
6. Place the cleaned pike into the wine mixture in the stew-pan.
7. Bring the mixture to a boil and then cover the stew-pan.
8. Let the pike cook until it is done. The cooking time will depend on the size of the pike but should be around 15-20 minutes.
9. While the pike is cooking, prepare the garnishes. Slice some lemon and peel some lemon peel.
10. Once the pike is cooked, remove it from the stew-pan and place it on a serving dish.
11. Arrange sippets around the pike on the serving dish.
12. Pour the broth, spices, and onions from the stew-pan over the pike and sippets.
13. Garnish the dish with slices of lemon and lemon peel.
14. Drizzle the pike with beaten butter.
15. Sprinkle grated manchet over the dish as a final garnish.
16. Serve the French-style boiled pike hot.

## Cooking time
Approximately 15-20 minutes, depending on the size of the pike.
