# Sage-Cream

## Description
Sage-Cream is a creamy dessert flavored with sage and sweetened with sugar. It has a delicate herbal flavor and a smooth, creamy texture.

## Options and commentary
- Instead of boiling the cream, you can also heat it gently on the stovetop until it is hot but not boiling.
- If you don't have red sage, you can use regular sage or any other fresh herb of your choice.
- Instead of Canary wine, you can use a sweet white wine or a non-alcoholic substitute like grape juice.
- If you don't have rose water, you can omit it or use a small amount of vanilla extract for flavor.

## Ingredients:
- 1 liter of cream
- 1/4 cup of red sage leaves, finely chopped
- 1/4 cup of Canary wine (or sweet white wine)
- 1/4 cup of rose water
- 1/2 cup of sugar

## Instructions:
1. In a large saucepan, heat the cream over medium heat until it starts to simmer. Do not let it boil.
2. In a mortar and pestle, pound the red sage leaves until they form a paste.
3. Add the sage paste, Canary wine, rose water, and sugar to the simmering cream. Stir well to combine.
4. Continue to simmer the cream mixture for about 10 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the sugar has dissolved and the flavors have melded together.
5. Remove the saucepan from the heat and let the mixture cool to room temperature.
6. Once cooled, strain the mixture through a fine-mesh sieve to remove any solids.
7. Pour the strained cream into individual serving dishes or a large serving bowl.
8. Cover the dishes or bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 2 hours, or until the cream has set and is chilled.
9. Serve the Sage-Cream chilled, garnished with a sprig of fresh sage if desired.
