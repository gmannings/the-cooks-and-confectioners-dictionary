# Tocks Combs

## Description
Tocks combs are a delicacy that were commonly used in 18th-century recipes, particularly in ragouts and bisques. They can also be served as a dish on their own. Tocks combs are the edible part of a rooster's comb and have a gelatinous texture.

## Options and commentary
Tocks combs may not be readily available in modern supermarkets. If you cannot find tocks combs, you can substitute them with other gelatinous ingredients such as chicken feet or pig's trotters.

## Ingredients:
- 1 pound tocks combs (or substitute with chicken feet or pig's trotters)
- Water for boiling
- Salt, to taste
- Optional: herbs and spices for flavoring (e.g., bay leaves, thyme, peppercorns)

## Instructions:
1. Place the tocks combs (or substitute) in a large pot and cover with water.
2. Add salt and any desired herbs and spices for flavoring.
3. Bring the water to a boil over high heat.
4. Reduce the heat to low and simmer the tocks combs for 2-3 hours, or until they are tender and the gelatin has dissolved.
5. Remove the tocks combs from the pot and drain them.
6. If desired, you can now use the tocks combs in a ragout or bisque recipe, or serve them as a dish on their own.

## Cooking time
2-3 hours
