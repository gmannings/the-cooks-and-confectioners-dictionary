# Foure a Breaft of Veal

## Description
This recipe involves boning a breast of veal, stuffing it with a mixture of sweet herbs, spices, and lemon peel, rolling it into a collar, and cooking it in a flavorful broth. The result is a tender and flavorful veal dish.

## Ingredients:
- 1 breast of veal
- Water, for soaking
- Assorted sweet herbs (such as parsley, thyme, and rosemary), finely shredded
- Salt
- Nutmeg
- Cinnamon
- Ginger, beaten
- Lemon peel, shredded
- Ginger, sliced
- 1 lemon, sliced

## Instructions:
1. Place the breast of veal in a large bowl or container and cover it with water. Allow it to soak for some time to remove any blood.

4. Spread the herb and spice mixture evenly on the inside of the breast of veal.

7. Add a bunch of sweet herbs to the pot.
8. Cover the pot and simmer the veal on low heat for a few hours, until it is almost cooked through.
9. Add the sliced ginger and lemon to the pot and continue simmering for another 30 minutes, until the veal is fully cooked and tender.
10. Remove the veal from the pot and let it rest for a few minutes before slicing and serving.
