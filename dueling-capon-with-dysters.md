# Dueling Capon with Dysters

## Description
This recipe is for a delicious and flavorful dish featuring a roasted capon served with a rich ragout of mushrooms, truffles, oysters, and veal gravy. The capon is first braised to ensure it is tender and juicy. The ragout is made by simmering mushrooms and truffles in veal gravy, thickened with a cullis of veal and ham. The oysters are briefly blanched and then added to the ragout. The finished dish is served warm and is sure to impress your guests.

## Ingredients:
- 1 capon
- Mushrooms
- Truffles
- Veal gravy
- Cullis of veal and ham
- Oysters

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to the appropriate temperature for roasting a capon.
2. Prepare the capon by dresing it ala braise. This involves seasoning the capon with salt and pepper and then browning it in a hot pan with some oil. Once browned, transfer the capon to a roasting pan and roast it in the preheated oven until cooked through and golden brown.
3. While the capon is roasting, prepare the ragout. Start by simmering the mushrooms and truffles in veal gravy over low heat on a stove.
4. In a separate pot, prepare the cullis of veal and ham by combining veal and ham with some stock or broth. Cook this mixture over low heat until it thickens.
5. Blanch the oysters by placing them in a pot with their own liquor and heating them gently over low heat. Be careful not to let them boil. Once blanched, remove the oysters from the pot and clean them well.
6. Add the blanched oysters to the simmering mushroom and truffle mixture. Heat the ragout, but do not let it boil.
7. Once the capon is cooked, remove it from the oven and let it drain briefly.
8. Place the capon on a serving dish and pour the warm ragout over it.
9. Serve the dueling capon with dysters warm.
