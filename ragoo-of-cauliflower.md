# Ragoo of Cauliflower

## Description
A ragoo of cauliflower is a dish made with cauliflower florets cooked in a flavorful sauce. The cauliflower is first boiled and then simmered in a cullis sauce made with veal and ham. The dish is thickened with a butter and flour mixture and finished with a touch of vinegar. It is typically served on small plates or dishes.

## Ingredients:
- 1 medium cauliflower
- 200g veal, diced
- 100g ham, diced
- 1 tablespoon butter
- 1 tablespoon flour
- 1 tablespoon vinegar

## Instructions:
1. Pick and clean the cauliflower, removing any leaves and tough stems.
2. Boil the cauliflower in a pot of water until it is tender but still firm. Drain the cauliflower and set aside.
3. In a saucepan, combine the diced veal and ham. Add enough water to cover the meat and bring to a simmer. Cook for about 20 minutes until the meat is tender.
4. Remove the meat from the saucepan and set aside. Reserve the cooking liquid.
5. In the same saucepan, add the cauliflower and enough of the reserved cooking liquid to cover it. Simmer the cauliflower for a few minutes to infuse it with the flavors of the veal and ham.
6. In a small bowl, mix the butter and flour together to form a paste.
7. Add the butter and flour mixture to the saucepan with the cauliflower. Stir well to combine and thicken the sauce.
8. Add the vinegar to the saucepan and stir to incorporate.
9. Continue to cook the cauliflower in the sauce for a few more minutes until it is heated through and the sauce has thickened.
10. Serve the ragoo of cauliflower on small plates or dishes.
