# Quinte Pye

## Description
Quinte Pye is a traditional 18th century pie made with preserved quinces. The quinces are cooked in a syrup made with water and sugar, then placed in a pie crust and baked. The pie is then glazed with the syrup for a sweet and tangy flavor.

## Ingredients:
- Preserved quinces
- Water
- Fine sugar
- Pie crust

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 180Â°C.
2. In a saucepan, combine water and fine sugar to make a syrup. Use an equal weight of syrup to the weight of the preserved quinces you are using.
3. Bring the syrup to a boil, skimming off any impurities that rise to the surface.
4. Add the preserved quinces to the syrup and let them boil until they become clear.
5. Remove the quinces from the syrup and cut them into halves or quarters.
6. Line a pie dish with the pie crust, making sure to leave enough dough for the top crust.
7. Place the quinces in the pie dish, arranging them evenly.
8. Sprinkle some more sugar over the quinces.
9. Cover the pie with the remaining pie crust, sealing the edges.
10. Bake the pie in the preheated oven for about 30-40 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown.
11. While the pie is baking, heat the remaining syrup in a saucepan until it thickens slightly.
12. Once the pie is baked, remove it from the oven and pour the thickened syrup over the top, glazing the pie.
13. Allow the pie to cool before serving.
