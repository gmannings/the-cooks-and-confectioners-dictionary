# Almond Cakes

## Description
Almond Cakes are a sweet and nutty treat made with ground almonds, sugar, and flour. They have a delicate texture and a subtle almond flavor. These cakes are perfect for afternoon tea or as a dessert.

## Options and commentary
- You can add a pinch of salt to enhance the flavor of the cakes.
- If you prefer a stronger almond flavor, you can add a few drops of almond extract.
- You can also add a sprinkle of sliced almonds on top of the cakes before baking for added texture and visual appeal.

## Ingredients:
- 450g blanched almonds
- 250g fine sugar
- 2 tablespoons rose water
- 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
- 2 egg whites
- Butter, for greasing
- Flour, for dusting
- Fine sugar, for dusting

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 180Â°C.
2. In a food processor, grind the blanched almonds until they form a fine powder.
3. Transfer the ground almonds to a mixing bowl and add the rose water. Mix well until the almonds lose their shine.
4. Add the fine sugar to the almond mixture and beat together until well combined.
5. In a separate bowl, whisk the egg whites until they form stiff peaks.
6. Gradually fold the flour into the beaten egg whites until fully incorporated.
7. Gently fold the almond mixture into the egg white mixture until well combined.
8. Grease the baking plates with butter and dust them with flour and fine sugar.
9. Spoon the batter into the prepared baking plates, filling them about three-quarters full.
10. Place the baking plates in the preheated oven and bake for about 15-20 minutes, or until the cakes are lightly browned.
11. Remove the cakes from the oven and let them cool slightly.
12. Transfer the cakes onto a brown paper to cool completely. This will help them become whiter in color.
