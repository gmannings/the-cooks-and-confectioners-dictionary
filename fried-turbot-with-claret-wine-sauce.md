# Fried Turbot with Claret-Wine Sauce

## Description
This recipe is for a delicious and flavorful fried turbot dish, served with a tangy claret-wine sauce. The turbot slices are first fried until half cooked, then stewed in a mixture of claret-wine, butter, onion, and nutmeg. The dish is then garnished with slices of orange or lemon, lemon peel, and served with a drizzle of beaten butter. It is a perfect main course for a special occasion or a fancy dinner party.

## Ingredients:
- 1 turbot, sliced
- Claret-wine (approximately 250 ml)
