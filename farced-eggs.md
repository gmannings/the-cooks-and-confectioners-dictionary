# Farced Eggs

## Description
Farced Eggs is a dish made with stuffed eggs. The eggs are filled with a mixture of cooked lettuce, mushrooms, parsley, sorrel, chervil, and egg yolks. The filling is seasoned with salt and nutmeg, then stewed in butter and cream. The dish is garnished with a separate mixture of egg whites, sweet herbs, and a red-hot fire shovel for color.

## Ingredients:
- 4 eggs
- 2 cabbage lettuces
- 1 mushroom
- 1 tablespoon parsley, chopped
- 1 tablespoon sorrel, chopped
- 1 tablespoon chervil, chopped
- Salt, to taste
- Nutmeg, to taste
- 2 tablespoons butter
- 2 tablespoons cream

## Instructions:
1. Boil the eggs until hard-boiled. Once cooked, remove the shells and separate the yolks from the whites. Set aside.
2. In a pot of boiling water, blanch the cabbage lettuces and mushroom for a few minutes until slightly tender. Drain and chop them finely.
3. In a pan, melt the butter over medium heat. Add the chopped lettuces, mushroom, parsley, sorrel, chervil, and egg yolks. Season with salt and nutmeg. Cook the mixture for a few minutes until the flavors meld together.
4. Stir in the cream and continue cooking until the mixture thickens slightly.
5. Transfer the cooked mixture to the bottom of a serving dish, spreading it evenly.
6. In a separate bowl, beat the egg whites until frothy. Add a pinch of salt and continue beating until stiff peaks form.
7. Place the beaten egg whites in a piping bag or a plastic bag with a corner snipped off. Pipe the egg whites around the brim of the serving dish to create a decorative garnish.
8. Heat a fire shovel until it turns red-hot. Hold the shovel close to the egg whites to lightly brown them and give them a touch of color.
9. Serve the farced eggs warm or chilled.
