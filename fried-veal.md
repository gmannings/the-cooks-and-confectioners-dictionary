# Fried Veal

## Description
This recipe calls for slices of veal to be coated in flour, seasoned, and then fried in hot suet. The dish is garnished with crispy bacon slices and can be served with gravy sauce or a butter and vinegar sauce.

## Options and commentary
- You can use either raw or roasted veal for this recipe.
- If you prefer a lighter option, you can use vegetable oil instead of suet for frying.
- The choice of sauce is up to your preference. Gravy sauce adds richness, while a butter and vinegar sauce provides a tangy flavor.

## Ingredients:
- 500g veal, sliced
- Flour, for coating
- Salt, to taste
- 1 egg
- Fresh thyme, stripped
- 100g suet or vegetable oil
- Thin slices of bacon, for garnish
- Gravy sauce or butter and vinegar sauce, for serving

## Instructions:
1. If using raw veal, ensure it is sliced into thin slices. If using roasted veal, slice it into thin slices.
2. Coat each slice of veal with flour, ensuring it is evenly coated. Season both sides with salt.
3. In a small bowl, beat the egg and add the stripped thyme. Mix well.
4. Dip each floured veal slice into the egg mixture, ensuring it is coated on both sides.
5. Heat the suet or vegetable oil in a frying pan until it is boiling hot.
6. Carefully place the veal slices into the hot suet or oil. Fry the veal, turning it only once, until it is cooked through and golden brown on both sides.
7. Once the veal is cooked, remove it from the pan and place it on a plate lined with paper towels to absorb any excess oil.
8. Clear the fat out of the pan and return it to the heat.
9. Fry thin slices of bacon in the pan until they are crispy. Remove them from the pan and set aside.
10. Arrange the fried veal slices on a serving dish and garnish with the crispy bacon slices.
11. Serve the fried veal with your choice of gravy sauce or butter and vinegar sauce.

## Cooking time
Approximately 20-30 minutes, depending on the thickness of the veal slices and the desired level of doneness.
