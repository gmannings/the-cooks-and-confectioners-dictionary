# Tanley for Lent

## Description
Tanley for Lent is a dish made with a mixture of herbs, almonds, and fish roe. It is then strained and combined with bread crumbs, rosewater, and sugar, before being fried in butter.

## Options and commentary
- You can use any combination of herbs you like, such as parsley, cilantro, dill, or mint.
- If you don't have fish roe, you can substitute it with finely chopped cooked fish.
- The dish can be served as a side dish or as a main course with some additional protein, such as grilled fish or roasted chicken.

## Ingredients:
- Assorted fresh herbs (such as parsley, cilantro, dill, or mint)
- 50g almonds
- 50g fish roe or finely chopped cooked fish
- 1 cup bread crumbs
- 1 tablespoon rosewater
- 1 tablespoon sugar
- Butter for frying

## Instructions:
1. In a mortar, pound the fresh herbs, almonds, and fish roe together until well combined and smooth.
2. Transfer the mixture to a fine-mesh strainer and press it through, collecting the strained mixture in a bowl.
3. Add the bread crumbs, rosewater, and sugar to the strained mixture and mix well until everything is evenly combined.
4. Heat a large skillet over medium heat and melt enough butter to coat the bottom of the skillet.
5. Take small portions of the mixture and shape them into patties or small balls.
6. Place the patties or balls in the skillet and fry them until golden brown on both sides, about 2-3 minutes per side.
7. Remove the fried tanley from the skillet and place them on a paper towel-lined plate to drain excess oil.
8. Serve the tanley warm as a side dish or as a main course with your choice of protein.
