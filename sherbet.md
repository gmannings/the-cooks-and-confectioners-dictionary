# Sherbet

## Description
Sherbet is a refreshing and sweet drink that was popular in the 18th century. It is made by boiling veal and calves feet to create a broth, which is then flavored with spices, lemon peel, and sugar. The broth is clarified and strained to remove any impurities, resulting in a clear and flavorful liquid. Sherbet can be enjoyed on its own or used as a base for other beverages.

## Ingredients:
- 1 filet of veal (fat removed)
- 2 calves feet
- Water
- White wine
- 2-3 cloves
- 1 stick of cinnamon
- Lemon peel
- Sugar
- 1 egg white

## Instructions:
1. In a large pot, combine the filet of veal, calves feet, water, and white wine. Make sure the meat is completely submerged in the liquid.
2. Bring the mixture to a boil and skim off any foam that rises to the surface. Continue to boil for a good while, until the meat is boiled to rags and two-thirds of the liquid has evaporated.
3. Remove the pot from heat and strain the broth through a cloth to remove any solids. Use feathers or a spoon to skim off any fat that floats on the surface.
4. Return the strained broth to a clean pot and add the cloves, cinnamon stick, lemon peel, and sugar according to your taste preference. 
5. Bring the mixture to a boil and let it simmer for a while to infuse the flavors. 
6. In a separate bowl, whisk the egg white until frothy. Slowly pour the frothy egg white into the simmering broth while stirring continuously. This will help clarify the liquid.
7. Continue to simmer the mixture for a few more minutes, then remove from heat.
8. Strain the sherbet through a fine-mesh strainer or a straining bag to remove any remaining impurities.
9. Allow the sherbet to cool completely before transferring it to bottles for storage.

## Options and commentary
- You can adjust the amount of sugar and other flavorings according to your taste preference. Start with a smaller amount and add more if desired.
- If you prefer a more intense flavor, you can let the broth simmer for a longer period of time before straining.
- Sherbet can be enjoyed as a refreshing drink on its own, or you can use it as a base for other beverages. Add sparkling water or soda for a fizzy sherbet drink, or mix it with fruit juice for a fruity twist.
- The sherbet can be stored in bottles in the refrigerator for a considerable amount of time.

## Cooking time
Approximately 2-3 hours.
