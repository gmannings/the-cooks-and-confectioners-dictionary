# Carrot Pudding

## Description
Carrot Pudding is a traditional British dessert made with carrots, bread, beef suet, cream, eggs, and flavored with nutmeg, salt, and sugar. It can be either boiled or baked and is typically served with a sauce made from butter, lime juice, and sugar.

## Options and commentary
- You can adjust the amount of sugar according to your taste preference.
- For a vegetarian version, you can substitute vegetable suet for beef suet.
- If you choose to bake the pudding, it will have a firmer texture compared to the boiled version.

## Ingredients:
- 2 medium-sized carrots
- 1 cup grated bread
- 225g beef suet, finely shredded (or vegetable suet for a vegetarian version)
- 1/2 cup cream
- 6 eggs
- 1/2 teaspoon grated nutmeg
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- Sugar to taste
- Butter, for serving
- Lime juice, for serving
- Sugar, for serving

## Instructions:
1. Peel the carrots and cut them into chunks. Place them in a pot of boiling water and cook until they are three-quarters cooked. This should take about 10-15 minutes. Drain the carrots and let them cool.
2. Once the carrots have cooled, shred them finely using a grater or food processor.
3. In a large mixing bowl, combine the shredded carrots, grated bread, shredded beef suet, cream, eggs, nutmeg, salt, and sugar. Mix well until all the ingredients are evenly combined.
4. If you choose to boil the pudding, transfer the mixture into a greased pudding basin or heatproof dish. Cover with a lid or foil and place it in a large pot filled with boiling water. Steam the pudding for about 2 hours, making sure to check the water level periodically and adding more boiling water if needed.
5. If you prefer to bake the pudding, preheat your oven to 180°C (350°F). Transfer the mixture into a greased baking dish and smooth the top. Bake for about 1 hour or until the pudding is set and golden brown on top.
6. While the pudding is cooking, prepare the sauce by melting butter in a saucepan and adding lime juice and sugar to taste. Stir until the sugar has dissolved and the sauce is well combined.
7. Once the pudding is cooked, remove it from the heat and let it cool for a few minutes. Serve the pudding warm with the butter and lime sauce drizzled over the top.
