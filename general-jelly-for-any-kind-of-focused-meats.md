# General Jelly for any Kind of Focused Meats

## Description
This recipe is for a versatile jelly that can be used to bind and glaze various types of focused meats. It is made from calves' feet and flavored with white wine and spices. The jelly is divided into three parts and colored with cochineal, saffron, and left natural. It is then sweetened with sugar and thickened with beaten eggs.

## Ingredients:
- 4 pairs of calves' feet
- Water
- 8 quarts (7.6 liters) of water
- 1 quart (0.95 liters) of white wine
- Cochineal (for coloring)
- Saffron (for coloring)
- Mace
- Ginger
- Nutmeg
- Cinnamon
- 6 eggs
- 1 pound (450 grams) of sugar

## Instructions:
1. Start by preparing the calves' feet. Remove the fat between the claws and take out the large bones. Soak the feet in water for 5 to 6 hours.
2. After soaking, place the calves' feet in a large pot with 8 quarts of water. Boil the feet until the liquid has reduced to 3 quarts (2.8 liters).
3. Strain the liquid to remove any solids and set it aside to cool. Once cooled, remove any settled impurities from the top.
4. Divide the jelly into three equal parts and transfer each part to a separate pot or pipkin.
5. To the first pot, add cochineal to color the jelly red. To the second pot, add saffron to color the jelly yellow. Leave the third pot without any additional coloring.
6. Add a little mace, a piece of ginger, some sliced nutmeg, and a bit of cinnamon to each pot.
7. In a separate bowl, beat the eggs until well combined. Add the sugar and continue to beat until the mixture is smooth.
8. Melt the jelly in each pot and gradually add the beaten eggs and sugar mixture to each pot, stirring well to combine.
9. Once all the ingredients are well mixed, heat the pots until the jelly is about to boil. Be careful not to let it boil.
10. Strain each pot of jelly to remove any solids or impurities.
11. Allow the jelly to cool completely before transferring it to storage containers.
12. Store the jelly in a cool place until ready to use.
