# Andolians

## Description
Andolians are a type of sausage made from the intestines of a hog. The intestines are cleaned, soaked, seasoned, and then boiled. They can be made to any desired length.

## Ingredients:
- Hog intestines
- Water
- Sage, chopped
- Salt
- Pepper
- Cloves
- Mace
- Coriander seed, crushed
- Interlarded bacon
- Spice (optional)

## Instructions:
1. Take the hog intestines and turn them inside out. Rinse them thoroughly under cold water to remove any debris or impurities.
2. Place the cleaned intestines in a large bowl and cover them with water. Let them soak for 24 hours.
3. After soaking, remove the intestines from the water and pat them dry with paper towels.
4. In a small bowl, mix together the chopped sage, salt, pepper, cloves, mace, and crushed coriander seed.
5. Season the fat sides of the intestines with the spice mixture. Make sure to coat them evenly.
6. Turn the fat sides inward again, so the seasoned side is on the inside.
7. Take one intestine and draw it over another, repeating this process until you reach the desired thickness for your sausages.
8. In a large pot, bring water to a boil. Add a piece of interlarded bacon, salt, and optional additional spices for flavor.
9. Carefully place the prepared sausages into the boiling water. Make sure they are fully submerged.
10. Tie the ends of the sausages tightly with kitchen twine to prevent them from unraveling during cooking.
11. Boil the sausages for approximately 1 hour, or until they are fully cooked and firm to the touch.
12. Once cooked, remove the sausages from the water and let them cool slightly.
13. Serve the Andolians as desired. They can be enjoyed hot or cold.
