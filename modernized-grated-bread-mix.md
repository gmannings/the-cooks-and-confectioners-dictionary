# Modernized Grated Bread Mix

## Description
This recipe provides various options for flavoring grated bread mix. The grated bread mix can be used as a coating for meats, as a topping for casseroles, or as a base for stuffing. The options include lemon or orange peel, sweet herbs, cinnamon, fennel and coriander seeds, and a sweet and savory mix for a pig.

## Options and commentary
- Lemon or orange peel: Use the zest of 1 lemon or orange, finely grated. If you don't have fresh citrus, you can use dried zest or even a few drops of lemon or orange extract.
- Sweet herbs: Use a combination of dried herbs such as thyme, rosemary, and sage. You can also add a pinch of dried parsley or basil.
- Cinnamon: Use 1 teaspoon of ground cinnamon.
- Fennel and coriander seeds: Use 1 teaspoon of each seed, ground into a powder using a mortar and pestle or a spice grinder.
- Sweet and savory mix for a pig: Use 2 egg yolks, 1/2 teaspoon of ground black pepper, 1/4 teaspoon of ground nutmeg, 1/4 teaspoon of ground ginger, 1 tablespoon of granulated sugar, and enough grated bread to coat the pig.
