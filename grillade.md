# Grillade

## Description
Grillade is a dish made with leftover cold fowl that is grilled and then served with a flavorful sauce. The fowl is seasoned with salt and pepper, grilled, and then coated in a sauce made with flour, lard, anchovies, oysters, nutmeg, capers, green lemon, broth, and vinegar.

## Ingredients:
- Leftover cold fowl (chicken, turkey, etc.)

4. In a frying pan, heat some lard (or vegetable oil) over medium heat.
5. Add flour to the hot lard and cook, stirring constantly, until the flour turns golden brown and becomes fragrant.
