# Frically Crabs

## Description
Frically Crabs is a dish made with minced crab meat cooked in a flavorful sauce and served in the crab's shell. It is a rich and indulgent seafood dish that can be served as an appetizer or a main course.

## Ingredients:
- 4 crabs
- 200 ml Claret wine
- 1 tablespoon shredded fennel
- 1/2 teaspoon grated nutmeg
- 50 g butter
- 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon
- 1/2 teaspoon ginger
- 2 egg yolks

## Instructions:
1. Start by preparing the crabs. Remove all the meat from the body of the crabs and set it aside. Break the claws and extract the meat from them as well. Finely mince all the crab meat and keep it aside.
2. In a saucepan, combine the Claret wine, shredded fennel, grated nutmeg, butter, cinnamon, and ginger. Heat the mixture over medium heat until the butter has melted and the ingredients are well combined.
3. In a separate bowl, whisk the egg yolks until they are well beaten. Slowly pour the beaten egg yolks into the saucepan while continuously whisking to prevent them from curdling.
4. Add the minced crab meat to the saucepan and stir well to coat the meat with the sauce. Cook the mixture over low heat for about 5 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the crab meat is heated through.
5. While the crab meat is cooking, clean the crab shells and set them aside.
6. Once the crab meat is cooked, carefully spoon it back into the cleaned crab shells, filling them up to the top. Garnish the filled shells with the small legs of the crabs.
7. Serve the frically crabs immediately as an appetizer or a main course.
