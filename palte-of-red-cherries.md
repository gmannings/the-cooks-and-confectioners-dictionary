# Palte of Red Cherries

## Description
This recipe is for making a sweet and tangy preserve of red cherries. The cherries are boiled until soft, strained, and mixed with sugar and apple pulp. The mixture is then boiled until thickened and spread onto plates to dry.

## Ingredients:
- 1 kg red cherries
- 500 g sugar
- 2 apples

## Instructions:
1. Remove the stems and stones from the cherries.
2. Place the cherries in a pot and boil them until they become very soft.
3. Strain the cherry pulp through a fine sieve to remove any solids.
4. Measure the strained cherry pulp and add an equal amount of sugar (e.g., for 1 pint of pulp, add 1 pound of sugar).
5. Peel and core the apples, then grate or puree them to make a smooth pulp.
6. Add the apple pulp to the cherry and sugar mixture and stir well.
7. Place the pot back on the stove and bring the mixture to a boil.
8. Reduce the heat to low and simmer the mixture until it thickens to the desired consistency, stirring occasionally to prevent sticking.
9. While the mixture is still hot, spread it onto plates in an even layer.
10. Allow the mixture to dry completely. This can be done by leaving the plates in a cool, dry place for several days or by using a food dehydrator or oven set to a low temperature.
11. Once the preserve is dry, carefully remove it from the plates and store it in an airtight container.

## Cooking time
- Boiling cherries: approximately 15-20 minutes
- Simmering the mixture: approximately 30-40 minutes
- Drying the preserve: several days or several hours in a low-temperature oven or food dehydrator
