# Cherry Wine

## Description
This recipe is for making cherry wine, as it was done in Kent in the 18th century. The cherries are mashed and fermented to create a sweet and fruity wine. The wine is then aged for several months to develop its flavors.

## Ingredients:
- Red cherries, fully ripe
- Sugar

## Instructions:
1. Take the red cherries and remove the stems. 
2. Mash the cherries, breaking the stones as you would with apples. 
3. Put the mashed cherries into a tub and cover it tightly. Let it sit for three days and nights. 
4. After three days, press the cherries to extract the juice. 
5. Transfer the juice back into the tub and cover it tightly. Let it sit for two more days. 
6. Carefully skim off any impurities that rise to the surface of the juice. 
7. Pour the juice off from the lees (sediment) into another tub. Let it sit for two more days to clarify. 
8. Skim off any impurities that rise to the surface again and pour the clarified juice off from the lees. 
9. To each gallon of juice, add one and a half pounds of sugar. Stir well to dissolve the sugar. 
10. Cover the tub tightly and let it sit overnight. 
11. The next day, pour the juice off from the lees once again. 
12. Let the juice sit for another day and then pour it off from the lees one more time. 
13. Transfer the juice into a vessel, such as a cask. 
14. If the lees are still visible and thick, repeat steps 11-13 until the juice is clear. 
15. Once the juice is in the cask, seal it tightly and let it age for eight months. 
16. After eight months, the wine should be clear and ready to be bottled. 
17. Alternatively, you can transfer the wine into another vessel and let it age for another eight months before bottling. 
18. The wine should not be consumed until it is at least a year old. If it is bottled when it is clear, it can be stored for up to seven years.
