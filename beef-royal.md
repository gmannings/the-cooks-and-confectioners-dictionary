# Beef Royal

## Description
Beef Royal is a classic 18th-century dish made with a boneless beef roast that is seasoned, larded with bacon, and cooked in a flavorful broth. The meat is then served with a rich sauce made from the cooking liquid, pickles, and fried oysters. It can be enjoyed hot or cold.

## Ingredients:
- 1.5 kg boneless beef roast (such as sirloin or rump)
- Salt and pepper, to taste
- 1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg
- 1/2 teaspoon ground cloves
- 1/2 teaspoon ground mace
- Zest of 1 lemon
- 1 teaspoon dried thyme
- 1 teaspoon dried savory
- 1 teaspoon dried marjoram
- 200 g bacon, cut into large pieces
- 1 liter beef broth
- 50 g unsalted butter
- 2 bay leaves
- 6 truffles, sliced
- 2 ox palates or sweetbreads, pulled into pieces
- 250 ml red wine (such as Claret or Bordeaux)
- 3 anchovies
- Pickles (such as gherkins or cornichons), for serving
- Fried oysters, for serving

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 180Â°C.
2. Place the boneless beef roast on a cutting board and use a meat mallet to pound it evenly to tenderize it.
3. In a small bowl, combine salt, pepper, nutmeg, cloves, mace, lemon zest, dried thyme, savory, and marjoram. Rub the mixture all over the beef roast, ensuring it is evenly coated.
4. Using a larding needle or a sharp knife, insert the pieces of bacon into the beef roast, spacing them evenly throughout the meat.
5. In a large stew-pan, melt the butter over medium heat. Once melted, brown the beef roast on both sides until nicely seared.
6. Pour the beef broth into the stew-pan, along with the browned butter. Add the bay leaves, sliced truffles, and ox palates or sweetbreads.
7. Cover the stew-pan with a lid and let it simmer over low heat for about 2-3 hours, or until the beef is tender. Check occasionally and add more broth if needed.
8. Once the beef is tender, remove it from the stew-pan and skim off any excess fat from the cooking liquid.
9. Pour the red wine into the stew-pan and add the anchovies. Return the beef to the stew-pan and heat it thoroughly.
10. In a separate pan, fry the oysters until golden and crispy.
11. Remove the beef from the stew-pan and slice it into thick pieces. Arrange the beef on a serving platter.
12. Strain the cooking liquid from the stew-pan and thicken it with a roux or cornstarch slurry to create a sauce.
13. Pour the sauce over the sliced beef and garnish with pickles and fried oysters.
14. Serve the Beef Royal hot or cold.
