# Compost of Plums

## Description
Compost of Plums is a sweet and tangy preserve made from plums. The plums are pricked, scalded, and then cooked in a sugar syrup until they become soft and tender. This preserve can be enjoyed on its own, spread on toast, or used as a topping for desserts.

## Ingredients:
- Plums
- Water
- Sugar

## Instructions:
1. Wash the plums and remove any stems or leaves.
2. Prick each plum several times with a pin.
3. Place the plums in a large pot and cover them with water.
4. Bring the water to a boil and let the plums simmer for a few minutes until they start to rise to the top.
5. Remove the plums from the pot and immediately transfer them to a bowl of cold water to cool them down quickly.
6. Once the plums are cool, drain them and return them to the pot.
7. Add enough water to the pot to cover the plums.
8. Bring the water to a boil again and let the plums simmer until they regain their color and become soft. This may take about 10-15 minutes.
9. In a separate pot, heat the sugar until it becomes thin and syrupy.
10. Add the plums to the sugar syrup and let them stand for several hours or overnight.
11. Transfer the plums and syrup to a copper pan or a heavy-bottomed pot.
12. Cook the plums in the syrup, stirring occasionally, until the sugar is thoroughly absorbed and the plums are soft and tender. This may take several boilings, depending on the desired consistency.
13. Skim off any scum that rises to the surface during the cooking process.
14. Once the plums are cooked to your desired tenderness and the syrup has thickened, remove the pot from the heat and let the compost of plums cool completely.
15. Transfer the compost of plums to sterilized jars and seal tightly.

## Cooking time
Approximately 1-2 hours, depending on the desired tenderness of the plums.
