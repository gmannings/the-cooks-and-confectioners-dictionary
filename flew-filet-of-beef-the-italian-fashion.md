# Flew à Filet of Beef the Italian Fashion

## Description
This recipe is a traditional Italian method of preparing a filet of beef. The beef is marinated in a mixture of white wine, spices, and herbs, then stewed until tender. It is served with the flavorful broth.

## Ingredients:
- 1 filet of beef (approximately 1 kg)
- 500 ml white wine
- 1 teaspoon black pepper
- 1 teaspoon salt
- For the Tamara powder:
  - 1 tablespoon coriander seeds
  - 1/2 tablespoon fennel seeds
  - 1/2 tablespoon anise seeds
  - 1 tablespoon cinnamon powder
  - 1 tablespoon cloves
  - 1/2 tablespoon winter savory powder
- 1 liter good quality beef broth
- Whole cloves
- Whole mace

## Instructions:
1. Remove the skins and sinews from the filet of beef.
2. Place the beef in a bowl and pour white wine over it. Crush the beef in the wine and wash it well.
3. Sprinkle black pepper and Tamara powder over the beef. Tamara powder is made by grinding together coriander seeds, fennel seeds, anise seeds, cinnamon powder, cloves, and winter savory powder.
4. Add salt to season the beef. Mix all the ingredients well.
5. Pour enough white wine over the beef to cover it completely. Place a board on top of the beef to keep it submerged.
6. Let the beef marinate in the refrigerator for two nights and a day.
7. After marinating, remove the beef from the bowl and transfer it to a stew-pan.
8. Add the beef broth to the stew-pan, making sure it is not salty. Do not add any of the pickle from the marinade.
9. Add whole cloves and mace to the stew-pan.
10. Cover the stew-pan tightly and let the beef stew over low heat until it is tender. This may take a few hours.
11. Once the beef is tender, remove it from the stew-pan and slice it.
12. Serve the sliced beef with some of the flavorful broth.

## Cooking time
Approximately 3-4 hours.
