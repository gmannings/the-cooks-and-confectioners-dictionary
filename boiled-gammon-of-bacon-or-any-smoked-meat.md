# Boiled Gammon of Bacon (or any smoked meat)

## Description
This recipe is for boiling a gammon of bacon or any other smoked meat, such as peat-tongues or hogs-cheeks. Boiling the meat with hay flowers or hay wrapped in a cloth will enhance the color, tenderness, and flavor of the meat.

## Ingredients:
- 1 gammon of bacon or smoked meat (approx. 1-2 kg)
- 3-4 handfuls of hay flowers (or substitute with hay tied up in a coarse bag or cloth)

## Instructions:
1. Fill a large kettle or pot with water and place it on the stove.
2. Add the hay flowers or the bag of hay to the water.
3. Bring the water to a boil over high heat.

## Cooking time
- Boil the gammon of bacon or smoked meat for approximately 20 minutes per 500 grams of meat, or until it reaches an internal temperature of 70Â°C.
- Cooking time may vary depending on the size and thickness of the meat, so it is recommended to use a meat thermometer to ensure it is cooked through.

## Options and commentary
- If you cannot find hay flowers, you can substitute with hay tied up in a coarse bag or cloth. This will still impart a similar flavor and tenderness to the meat.
- You can serve the boiled gammon of bacon as is, or you can glaze it with a mixture of honey, mustard, and brown sugar and then roast it in the oven for a crispy exterior.
- This boiled gammon of bacon can be served hot or cold, and it is often enjoyed as a centerpiece for a festive meal or sliced and used in sandwiches or salads.
