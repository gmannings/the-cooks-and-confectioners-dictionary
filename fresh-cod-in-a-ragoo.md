# Fresh Cod in a Ragoo

## Description
This recipe is for a delicious and flavorful dish of fresh cod cooked in a ragoo sauce. The cod is boiled in a flavorful broth and then served with a rich sauce made from burnt butter, fried flour, capers, and oysters. The dish is finished with a sprinkle of black pepper and a squeeze of lemon juice for added freshness.

## Ingredients:
- 1 fresh cod fillet (approximately 500g)
- Water
- Vinegar
- Salt
- Pepper
- 1 bay leaf
- 1 lemon
- 50g butter
- 2 tablespoons flour
- 2 tablespoons capers
- 100g oysters (optional)
- Black pepper (to taste)
- Lemon juice (to taste)

## Instructions:
1. Scale the cod fillet and rinse it under cold water.
2. In a large pot, add enough water to cover the cod fillet. Add a splash of vinegar, a pinch of salt, a pinch of pepper, a bay leaf, and the juice of half a lemon.
3. Bring the water to a boil over medium heat.
4. Carefully add the cod fillet to the boiling water and reduce the heat to low. Simmer the cod for about 10-15 minutes, or until it is cooked through and flakes easily with a fork.
5. While the cod is cooking, prepare the ragoo sauce. In a separate saucepan, melt the butter over medium heat.
6. Once the butter has melted, continue cooking it until it turns a golden brown color. Be careful not to burn it.
7. Add the flour to the browned butter and stir continuously for a few minutes, until the flour is cooked and has a slightly nutty aroma.
8. Add the capers and oysters (if using) to the saucepan and cook for another minute or two, until heated through.
9. Remove the saucepan from the heat and set aside.
10. Once the cod is cooked, carefully remove it from the pot and transfer it to a serving dish.
11. Pour the ragoo sauce over the cod, ensuring that it is evenly coated.
12. Sprinkle some black pepper over the top of the dish and squeeze the juice of the remaining half lemon over it.
13. Serve the fresh cod in a ragoo immediately, while it is still hot.
