# Cream Cheese

## Description
Cream cheese is a soft, spreadable cheese made from milk and cream. It has a smooth and creamy texture with a slightly tangy flavor. This recipe provides instructions for making cream cheese using traditional methods from the 18th century.

## Options and commentary
- You can use store-bought milk and cream instead of warm milk from the cow.
- Almonds can be substituted with almond meal or almond flour.
- Rosewater can be found in specialty stores or online.
- Cinnamon powder can be substituted with ground cinnamon.
- Fine sugar can be regular granulated sugar.
- Rennet is a natural enzyme used to coagulate milk. It can be found in specialty stores or online.

## Ingredients:
- 1 gallon (3.8 liters) of milk
- 1 pound (454 grams) of almonds, finely ground
- 1 quart (946 milliliters) of cream
- 1/2 pint (237 milliliters) of rosewater
- 1/2 ounce (14 grams) of cinnamon powder
- 1 pound (454 grams) of fine sugar
- Rennet (follow package instructions for the amount needed)

## Instructions:
1. Warm the milk in a large pot on the stove. If using store-bought milk, heat it gently until it reaches a warm temperature.
2. In a mortar, pound the almonds until they are finely ground.
3. In a separate bowl, combine the ground almonds, cream, rosewater, cinnamon powder, and fine sugar.
4. Add the almond mixture to the warm milk and stir well.
5. Add the appropriate amount of rennet to the milk and cream mixture according to the package instructions. Stir gently to incorporate.
6. Allow the mixture to sit undisturbed until it curdles and the whey separates from the curds. This may take several hours or overnight.
7. Once the curds have formed, carefully pour off the whey.
8. Transfer the curds to a cheesecloth-lined colander or strainer to drain excess liquid.
9. Gather the corners of the cheesecloth and tie them together to create a bundle.
10. Hang the cheesecloth bundle over a bowl or sink and allow the cheese to drain for several hours or until it reaches the desired consistency.
11. Once the cheese has drained, remove it from the cheesecloth and transfer it to a container.
12. Store the cream cheese in the refrigerator until ready to use.
