# Clotted Cream

## Description
Clotted cream is a thick, rich cream that is traditionally served with scones or desserts. It has a velvety texture and a slightly sweet taste. This recipe yields a creamy and indulgent clotted cream with a hint of rose flavor.

## Ingredients:
- 2 liters of fresh milk
- 500 ml of heavy cream
- 3 tablespoons of rose water
- Sugar for serving

## Instructions:
1. In a large pan, combine the fresh milk, heavy cream, and rose water.
2. Place the pan over low heat on a stovetop or use a double boiler to prevent scorching.
3. Heat the mixture gently, stirring occasionally, until it reaches a temperature of 80°C (176°F). Do not let it boil.
4. Once the mixture reaches the desired temperature, remove it from the heat and let it cool to room temperature.
5. Cover the pan with a clean cloth or plastic wrap and let it sit undisturbed at room temperature for 24 hours. This will allow the cream to rise to the surface and form clots.
6. After 24 hours, carefully remove the clotted cream from the surface using a clean board or spatula. Be sure to leave any remaining liquid behind.
7. Place the clotted cream in a serving dish, arranging any remaining clots around the edges.
8. Sprinkle sugar over the clotted cream to taste.
9. Serve the clotted cream with scones, desserts, or fresh fruit.
