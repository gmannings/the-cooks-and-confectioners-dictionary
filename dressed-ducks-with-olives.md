# Dressed Ducks with Olives

## Description
This recipe is for dressed ducks with olives. The ducks can be prepared either by braising or roasting. The dish is then served with a ragout made with mushrooms, gravy, veal and ham cullis, and stoned olives. It is a flavorful and rich dish that can be enjoyed as a main course.

## Options and commentary
- You can choose to braise the ducks or roast them, depending on your preference.
- If you prefer a richer flavor, you can use duck or chicken stock instead of gravy.
- The veal and ham cullis adds depth to the ragout, but if you don't have it, you can omit it or substitute with a small amount of tomato paste.
- The dish can be served with a side of roasted vegetables or mashed potatoes.

## Ingredients:
- 2 ducks
- 200g mushrooms, sliced
- 250ml gravy or duck/chicken stock
- 2 tbsp veal and ham cullis (or substitute with tomato paste)
- 100g stoned olives
- Salt and pepper to taste

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F) if roasting the ducks. If braising, preheat the oven to 160°C (320°F).
2. If roasting the ducks, season them with salt and pepper and place them on a roasting rack in a roasting pan. Roast for about 1.5 to 2 hours, or until the internal temperature reaches 74°C (165°F). If braising, skip this step.
3. In a saucepan, sauté the mushrooms until they release their moisture and start to brown.
4. Add the gravy or stock to the saucepan with the mushrooms and bring to a simmer.
5. Stir in the veal and ham cullis (or tomato paste) to thicken the sauce.
6. In a separate pot, bring water to a boil and add the stoned olives. Let them boil for a few minutes, then drain.
7. Add the stoned olives to the saucepan with the mushroom sauce and simmer for a few more minutes.
8. Once the ducks are cooked, remove them from the oven and let them rest for a few minutes.
9. Carve the ducks and arrange them on a serving platter.
10. Pour the mushroom and olive ragout over the ducks.
11. Serve the dressed ducks with olives immediately.
