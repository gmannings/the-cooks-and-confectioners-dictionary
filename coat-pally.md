# Coat Pally

## Description
Coat Pally is a dish made from a hind-quarter of a fat goat, which is skinned, boned, and cut into steaks. The steaks are then seasoned with salt, pepper, nutmeg, and minced thyme. They are marinated in claret overnight and then placed in a pastry crust. The dish is baked and served with a rich gravy made from the pan drippings.

## Ingredients:
- 1 hind-quarter of a fat goat
- Salt
- Pepper
- Nutmeg
- Fresh thyme, minced
- Claret (red wine)
- Beef suet
- Strong broth
- Pastry crust

## Instructions:
1. Skin the hind-quarter of the goat and bone it. Cut it into steaks.
2. Place the steaks on a cutting board and use a rolling pin to beat them until they are tender.
3. Season the steaks with salt, pepper, nutmeg, and minced thyme.
4. Place the seasoned steaks in a bowl and pour enough claret over them to cover. Let them marinate in the claret overnight.
5. Preheat the oven to the temperature specified in your pastry crust recipe.
6. Roll out the pastry crust and line a baking dish or pie pan with it.
7. Remove the steaks from the marinade and place them in the pastry crust.
8. Sprinkle some beef suet over the steaks.
9. Cover the dish with another layer of pastry crust, sealing the edges.
10. Place the dish in the preheated oven and bake according to the instructions for your pastry crust, or until the crust is golden brown and cooked through.
11. While the dish is baking, place the goat bones in a pan along with a pint of claret and some strong broth.
12. Cover the pan tightly with a layer of coarse pastry crust.
13. Place the pan in the oven and bake until the crust is golden brown and cooked through.
14. Once both the dish and the pan with the bones are baked, remove them from the oven.
15. Carefully remove the crust from the pan with the bones, being cautious of the hot liquid inside.
16. Pour the liquid from the pan into the dish with the baked goat steaks, filling the pastry crust with the rich gravy.
17. Serve the Coat Pally hot.
