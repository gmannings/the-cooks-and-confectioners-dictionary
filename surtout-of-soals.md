# Surtout of Soals

## Description
Surtout of Soals is a dish made with minced carp and eel, mixed with mushrooms, chives, and parsley. It is seasoned with salt, pepper, spices, and herbs. The mixture is then combined with breadcrumbs, milk or cream, and eggs to create a thick paste. The paste is used to cover fried soles, which are then simmered in a sauce made with butter, mushrooms, truffles, fish broth, and herbs. The dish is finished by spreading the remaining paste on the bottom of a dish, pouring the ragout of soles on top, and covering it with the paste. It is then baked until golden brown and served hot.

## Options and commentary
- Instead of using carp and eel, you can use any firm white fish like cod or haddock.
- If you don't have mushrooms or truffles, you can omit them or use other vegetables like onions or leeks.
- You can use either milk or cream for the sauce, depending on your preference.
- To make it more flavorful, you can add a splash of white wine or lemon juice to the sauce.
- The dish can be served as a main course with a side of vegetables or as an appetizer with a salad.
