# Chicken Bullion Blanc

## Description
Chicken Bullion Blanc is a dish made with minced chicken breast, bacon, bread, milk, marrow, and eggs. The mixture is seasoned with salt, pepper, nutmeg, and lemon juice, then stuffed into chicken and baked. The leftover forcéd meat can be used to make patties to garnish the chicken.

## Options and commentary
- You can use boneless, skinless chicken breasts instead of a whole chicken.
- If you prefer a leaner option, you can use turkey breast instead of chicken breast.
- Instead of using a French roll, you can use breadcrumbs soaked in milk.
- Marrow can be replaced with butter or vegetable oil.
- You can add additional herbs and spices to the forcéd meat mixture, such as parsley or thyme.
- If you don't want to bake the chicken, you can also cook it on the stovetop or grill.
- Serve the chicken with a side of vegetables or a salad for a complete meal.

## Ingredients:
- 500g chicken breast
- 100g bacon
- 1 French roll or 50g breadcrumbs
- 100ml milk
- 50g marrow, butter, or vegetable oil
- 1 hard-boiled egg yolk
- 1 raw egg yolk
- Salt and pepper to taste
- 1/2 teaspoon nutmeg
- Juice of 1 lemon

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 180°C.
2. Mince the chicken breast and bacon together until finely chopped.
3. In a separate bowl, crumble the French roll or mix the breadcrumbs with the milk until well soaked.
4. In a large mixing bowl, combine the minced chicken and bacon mixture, soaked French roll or breadcrumbs, marrow (or butter/vegetable oil), hard-boiled egg yolk, raw egg yolk, salt, pepper, nutmeg, and lemon juice. Mix well until all the ingredients are evenly incorporated.
5. Take the chicken breasts and make a slit lengthwise in each one, creating a pocket for the forcéd meat.
6. Stuff the forcéd meat mixture into the pockets of the chicken breasts, ensuring they are evenly filled.
7. Place the stuffed chicken breasts on a baking dish or tray.
8. If desired, use any leftover forcéd meat mixture to make small patties.
9. Bake the stuffed chicken breasts and patties in the preheated oven for approximately 25-30 minutes, or until the chicken is cooked through and the patties are golden brown.
10. Remove from the oven and let the chicken rest for a few minutes before serving.
11. Serve the chicken bullion blanc with the patties as a garnish.
