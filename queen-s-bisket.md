# Queen's Bisket

## Description
Queen's Bisket is a type of biscuit or cookie that was popular in the 18th century. It is made with a mixture of flour, sugar, eggs, and coriander seeds. The biscuits are baked until they turn brown and then left to dry in a dry place.

## Ingredients:
- 675g flour
- 675g fine sugar
- 24 egg whites
- 18 egg yolks
- Coriander seeds, to taste

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 180Â°C.
2. In a large bowl, combine the flour, sugar, and coriander seeds.
3. In a separate bowl, whisk together the egg whites and egg yolks until well combined.
4. Gradually add the egg mixture to the dry ingredients, stirring well after each addition, until a soft dough forms. If the dough is too dry, you can add a little yeast to moisten it.
5. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or silicone mat.
6. Take a small portion of the dough and shape it into a rectangle about 5cm wide and 10cm long. Repeat with the remaining dough, leaving some space between each biscuit on the baking sheet.
7. Place the baking sheet in the preheated oven and bake for about 15-20 minutes, or until the biscuits begin to turn brown.
8. Remove the biscuits from the oven and transfer them to a wire rack to cool completely.
9. Once cooled, place the biscuits on a paper in a dry place to further dry out and harden.
