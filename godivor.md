# Godivor

## Description
Godivor is a traditional dish made with minced veal, bacon, mushrooms, and various herbs. It is cooked in a stewpan and resembles a pie.

## Options and commentary
- You can use ground veal instead of mincing a leg of veal.
- If you cannot find parboiled bacon, regular bacon will work as well.
- Feel free to adjust the amount of mushrooms, truffles, and herbs according to your taste preferences.
- The dish is traditionally cooked between two gentle fires, but you can use a stovetop on low heat instead.

## Ingredients:
- 500g minced veal
- 200g parboiled bacon, chopped
- 100g fat (such as lard or butter)

4. In a separate bowl, beat the whole eggs and egg yolks together.
5. Squeeze out the excess gravy from the soaked bread crumb and add it to the meat mixture.
6. Pour the beaten eggs into the bowl with the meat mixture. Mix until everything is well combined.
7. Line the bottom of a stewpan with thin slices of bacon.
