# Egg Pie

## Description
Egg Pie is a traditional dish made with hard-boiled eggs, beef suet, spices, dried fruits, and a sweet pastry crust. It is a savory and slightly sweet pie that can be served as a main course or as a dessert.

## Options and commentary
- You can use butter or vegetable shortening instead of beef suet for a vegetarian version.
- Feel free to adjust the amount of spices, sugar, and dried fruits according to your taste preferences.
- You can add other ingredients like chopped nuts or grated cheese for extra flavor and texture.
- Serve the Egg Pie warm or at room temperature with a side of wine or a dollop of whipped cream for a dessert-like experience.

## Ingredients:
- 12 hard-boiled eggs
- 200g beef suet (or substitute with butter or vegetable shortening)
- Salt, to taste
- 1 tsp ground spice blend (such as cinnamon, nutmeg, and cloves)
- Zest of 1 lemon
- 1 tsp rose water
- 50g sugar
- 250g dates, pitted and sliced
- 200g currants
- 1 apple, peeled, cored, and finely shredded
- Pastry crust for a double-crust pie

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F).
2. In a large bowl, mince the egg yolks and beef suet together until well combined.
3. Add salt, ground spice blend, lemon zest, rose water, sugar, dates, currants, and shredded apple to the bowl. Mix everything together until evenly distributed.
4. Roll out the pastry crust and line a pie dish with one of the crusts.
5. Pour the egg mixture into the pie dish, spreading it evenly.
6. Cover the pie with the second crust, sealing the edges by crimping or pressing with a fork.
7. Make a few small slits on the top crust to allow steam to escape during baking.
8. Place the pie in the preheated oven and bake for about 45-50 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown and the filling is heated through.
9. Remove the pie from the oven and let it cool for a few minutes before serving.
10. Serve the Egg Pie warm or at room temperature. Optionally, serve with a glass of wine or a dollop of whipped cream.
