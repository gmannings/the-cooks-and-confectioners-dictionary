# Marmalade of Currants

## Description
This recipe is for making a delicious marmalade using ripe red currants. The currants are boiled with raspberry juice and sugar until they break down and become thick like marmalade. The addition of rose water adds a fragrant touch to the marmalade.

## Ingredients:
- 500g ripe red currants
- 200g raspberries
- 500g sugar
- Rose water

## Instructions:
1. Pick the red currants, removing any stems or leaves. 
2. Squeeze out the juice from some of the currants and set it aside.
3. In a large pot, combine the currant juice and raspberry juice.
4. Add the whole currants to the pot and gently boil them until they begin to break down.
5. Once the currants start to break down, add the sugar to the pot. Make sure the sugar has been boiled to a candy height (approximately 115°C/240°F).
6. Continue boiling the mixture, mashing the currants as they cook.
7. Skim off any foam that forms on the surface of the marmalade.
8. Add a splash of rose water to the pot and continue boiling until the mixture reaches a thick, marmalade-like consistency.
9. Once the marmalade has thickened, transfer it to a well-glazed pot for storage.
