# Pliable Pastry for Round Pastries

## Description
This recipe will guide you in making a pliable pastry dough that can be used to make round pastries. The dough is easy to work with and can be shaped into various forms. Once shaped, the pastries are dried in a low-temperature oven to achieve a crisp texture.

## Ingredients:
- 250 grams all-purpose flour
- 125 grams unsalted butter, cold and cubed
- 1/4 teaspoon salt
- 1 large egg
- 2 tablespoons cold water

## Instructions:
1. In a large mixing bowl, combine the flour and salt.
2. Add the cold, cubed butter to the bowl.
3. Using your fingertips or a pastry cutter, rub the butter into the flour until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs.
4. In a separate small bowl, beat the egg with the cold water.
5. Make a well in the center of the flour mixture and pour in the beaten egg mixture.
6. Stir the ingredients together with a fork until they start to come together.
7. Transfer the dough onto a clean, lightly floured surface.
8. Knead the dough gently for a few minutes until it forms a smooth ball.
9. Wrap the dough in plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes to allow it to rest.
