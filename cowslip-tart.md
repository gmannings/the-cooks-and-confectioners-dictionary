# Cowslip Tart

## Description
Cowslip Tart is a sweet and creamy dessert made with cowslip blossoms, cream, eggs, and flavored with rosewater. It is traditionally baked in a dish or pastry crust.

## Options and commentary
- Cowslip blossoms can be difficult to find, so a modern alternative would be to use dried cowslip flowers or substitute with another edible flower such as elderflower or lavender.
- Naples biscuit can be replaced with ladyfingers or any other type of sweet biscuit.
- Rosewater can be substituted with vanilla extract or any other desired flavoring.
- The tart can be baked in a traditional pastry crust or made crustless for a lighter version.

## Ingredients:
- 1 gallon of cowslip blossoms (or substitute with dried cowslip flowers or other edible flowers)
- 1/2 pound of Naples biscuit (or substitute with ladyfingers or sweet biscuits)
- 1 1/2 pints of cream
- 8 egg yolks
- Salt, to taste
- Sugar, to taste
- Rosewater (or substitute with vanilla extract or other flavoring)

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F).
2. Cut the cowslip blossoms into small pieces and pound them in a mortar until they form a paste.
3. Grate the Naples biscuit and add it to the cowslip blossom paste.
4. In a skillet, heat the cream until it starts to boil. Remove from heat.
5. In a separate bowl, beat the egg yolks with a little cream until well combined. Be careful not to curdle the mixture.
6. Gradually add the cowslip blossom and biscuit mixture to the beaten egg yolks, stirring continuously.
7. Season the mixture with salt, sugar, and rosewater (or desired flavoring), adjusting to taste.
8. Pour the mixture into a baking dish or pastry crust.
9. Bake in the preheated oven for approximately 30-40 minutes, or until the tart is set and golden brown on top.
10. Remove from the oven and allow to cool before serving.
