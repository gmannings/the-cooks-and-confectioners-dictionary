# Farced Mutton Cutlets

## Description
Farced Mutton Cutlets are small, breaded and baked meat patties made from minced veal or mutton, mixed with bacon, mushrooms, truffles, herbs, and spices. They are then shaped into cutlets and baked until golden brown. These cutlets can be served as a garnish for larger dishes or as a standalone appetizer.

## Ingredients:
- 500g veal or mutton
- 100g blanched bacon
- 50g mushrooms
- 50g truffles (optional)
- 2 tablespoons chives, finely chopped
- 2 tablespoons parsley, finely chopped
- 1 French roll, soaked in gravy or milk
- 100ml cream
- 2 egg yolks
- Salt and pepper to taste
- Bards of bacon for wrapping
- Bread crumbs for coating

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 180Â°C.
2. In a large pot, boil the veal or mutton in broth until tender. Remove the meat from the bones and set aside.
3. Finely mince the blanched bacon, mushrooms, truffles (if using), chives, parsley, and the cooked veal or mutton.
4. In a mortar and pestle, pound the minced ingredients together with spices and seasonings until well combined.
5. Add the soaked French roll, cream, and egg yolks to the mortar and continue pounding until the mixture forms a smooth paste. Be careful not to make it too liquid.
6. Cut bards of bacon into pieces that are the same size as the cutlets.
7. Take each piece of bacon and spread a layer of the farce mixture on top. Shape the mixture into the form of a cutlet using a knife dipped in beaten eggs.
8. Coat each farced cutlet with bread crumbs.
9. Place the cutlets in a tart pan and bake in the preheated oven for about 20 minutes, or until they are golden brown and cooked through.
10. Serve the farced mutton cutlets as a garnish for larger dishes or on plates or small dishes as appetizers.
