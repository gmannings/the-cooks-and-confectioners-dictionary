# Poached Eggs in Syrup with Pistachios and Citrus

## Description
This recipe is a modernized version of an 18th-century recipe for poached eggs in syrup. The eggs are gently poached in a sweet syrup and served with pistachios, orange flowers, and slices of lemon peel. The dish has a delicate sweetness and a refreshing citrus flavor.

## Options and commentary
- You can adjust the sweetness of the syrup by adding more or less sugar according to your taste.
- If you don't have orange flowers, you can omit them or substitute with a small amount of orange zest.
- You can use any type of nuts instead of pistachios, such as almonds or hazelnuts.
- The lemon juice adds a tangy flavor to the dish, but you can omit it if you prefer a sweeter taste.

## Ingredients:
- 4 eggs
- 200g sugar
- 100ml water
- 50g pistachios, chopped
- 1 tablespoon orange flowers or 1 teaspoon orange zest
- 1 lemon, sliced
- Juice of 1 lemon

## Instructions:
1. In a saucepan, combine the sugar and water to make the syrup. Heat over medium heat until the sugar has dissolved completely.
2. Increase the heat to high and bring the syrup to a boil. Reduce the heat to low and let it simmer for about 5 minutes to thicken slightly.
3. In a separate bowl, whisk the eggs yolks gently.
4. Take a silver spoon and dip it into the simmering syrup. Carefully place one egg yolk onto the spoon and gently lower it into the syrup. Repeat with the remaining egg yolks.
5. Poach the egg yolks in the syrup for about 2-3 minutes, or until they are cooked to your desired level of doneness. Use a slotted spoon to carefully remove the poached egg yolks from the syrup and transfer them to a serving plate.
6. In the same syrup, add the chopped pistachios, orange flowers or zest, and lemon slices. Let them simmer in the syrup for about 2 minutes.
7. Remove the pistachios, orange flowers or zest, and lemon slices from the syrup using a slotted spoon and arrange them on top of the poached egg yolks.
8. Sprinkle a little lemon juice over the poached eggs and garnish with additional pistachios, if desired.
9. Serve the poached eggs immediately, either warm or at room temperature.
