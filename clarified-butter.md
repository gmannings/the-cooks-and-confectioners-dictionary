# Clarified Butter

## Description
This recipe provides instructions on how to clarify butter, which removes the milk solids and water content, resulting in a clear, pure butterfat. Clarified butter has a higher smoke point and longer shelf life compared to regular butter, making it ideal for cooking and saut√©ing.

## Ingredients:
- Unsalted butter

## Instructions:
1. Place the unsalted butter in a saucepan and melt it over low heat. 
2. Once the butter has completely melted, remove the saucepan from the heat and let it sit for a few minutes to allow the milk solids to settle at the bottom.
3. Carefully pour the clear, melted butter into a separate container, leaving behind the milky residue at the bottom of the saucepan. This is the first separation of the oily part.
4. In the same saucepan, add a small amount of broth (chicken or vegetable) to the remaining milky residue. 
5. Place the saucepan back on the heat and stir the mixture continuously until it thickens and becomes a smooth sauce. This is the second separation of the dregs.
6. Remove the saucepan from the heat and continue stirring the sauce for a few more minutes to prevent a skin from forming on the surface.
7. Gently pour off the oily butterfat from the saucepan, leaving behind the thickened sauce. This is the third separation of the oily part.
8. Return the saucepan to the heat and continue stirring the thickened sauce until it becomes strong, thick, and white in color. This is the final step to extract the remaining butterfat.
9. Once the sauce has reached the desired consistency, remove it from the heat and let it cool slightly.
10. Carefully pour the clarified butter into a clean container, leaving behind any sediment or impurities that may have formed during the process.
11. Allow the clarified butter to cool completely before covering and storing it in the refrigerator.
