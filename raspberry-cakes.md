# Raspberry Cakes

## Description
Raspberry cakes are sweet treats made with ripe raspberries and candied sugar. The raspberries are cooked with sugar syrup and then dried to create a candy-like texture. These cakes can be made with or without seeds, depending on personal preference.

## Ingredients:
- 500g ripe raspberries
- 1kg double-refined sugar
- Water

## Instructions:
1. In a saucepan, combine the raspberries and sugar. Use a fork or a potato masher to crush the raspberries and mix them with the sugar.
2. Add a little water to the saucepan to help dissolve the sugar and create a syrup.
3. Place the saucepan over medium heat and bring the mixture to a boil. Stir occasionally to prevent the sugar from burning.
4. Continue boiling the mixture until it reaches a candy-like consistency. This can take about 20-30 minutes. You can test the consistency by dropping a small amount of the syrup into a bowl of cold water. It should form a firm ball.
5. Once the syrup has reached the desired consistency, remove the saucepan from the heat.
6. If you prefer your cakes without seeds, strain the raspberry syrup through a fine-mesh sieve to remove the seeds. Otherwise, you can skip this step.
7. Prepare little tin hoops or plates by greasing them lightly with oil or butter.
8. Pour the raspberry syrup into the tin hoops or drop spoonfuls onto the plates. Make sure to spread the syrup evenly.
9. Place the tin hoops or plates in a warm oven or a food dehydrator. Set the temperature to the lowest setting.
10. Keep turning the cakes every few hours to ensure even drying. This process can take several hours or even overnight, depending on the thickness of the cakes and the drying conditions.
11. Once the cakes are completely dry and firm, remove them from the oven or dehydrator and let them cool completely.
12. Store the raspberry cakes in an airtight container to keep them fresh.

## Cooking time
Several hours to overnight, depending on drying conditions.
