# Quince Tart

## Description
A quince tart is a sweet pastry dessert made with layers of quince and other winter fruits, flavored with orange peel and cinnamon. The tart is baked until golden and served as a delicious treat.

## Options and commentary
- You can use either fresh quinces or quinces that have been stored dry in straw.
- If quinces are not available, you can substitute with other hard winter fruits such as apples or pears.
- Pippins are a type of apple, but you can use any other hard winter apple variety.
- The syrup of quinces can be made by simmering quince slices with sugar and water until thickened.
- The tart can be served warm or cold, and can be accompanied by whipped cream or vanilla ice cream.

## Ingredients:
- 4 quinces
- 4 pippins or other hard winter fruit
- Scraped peel of 1 orange
- Syrup of quinces (made from quince slices, sugar, and water)
- Fine sugar
- Powdered cinnamon
- Pie crust (store-bought or homemade)

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F).
2. Peel and core the quinces. Cut them into quarters and then into thin slices.
3. Peel and core the pippins or other hard winter fruit. Cut them into quarters and thin slices.
4. Roll out the pie crust and line a tart pan with it.
5. Start by arranging a layer of quince slices in the tart pan, followed by a layer of pippin slices. Repeat the layers until all the fruit is used, scattering scraped orange peel among the layers.
6. Pour the syrup of quinces over the fruit, ensuring it is evenly distributed.
7. In a small bowl, mix together fine sugar and powdered cinnamon. Sprinkle this mixture over the top of the tart.
8. Place the tart in the preheated oven and bake for approximately 45 minutes, or until the crust is golden and the fruit is tender.
9. Remove the tart from the oven and allow it to cool before serving.
