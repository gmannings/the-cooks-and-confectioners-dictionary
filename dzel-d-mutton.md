# Dzel'd Mutton

## Description
Dzel'd Mutton is a dish made with boiled mutton neck, flavored with lemon peel and herbs, and served with a stew of oysters in a white wine and broth sauce. The dish is garnished with lemon or barberries.

## Options and commentary
- Instead of mutton neck, you can use lamb neck or lamb shoulder.
- If you don't have oysters, you can substitute with clams or mussels.
- Lemon peel can be replaced with lemon zest.
- Barberries can be difficult to find, so you can use cranberries or pomegranate seeds as a garnish.

## Ingredients:
- 1 mutton neck (or lamb neck/shoulder)
- Lemon peel (or lemon zest)
- Salt
- Water
- Bunch of sweet herbs (such as thyme, rosemary, and parsley)
- 1/2 pint (240 ml) oysters
- 1/2 pint (240 ml) white wine
- 1/2 pint (240 ml) strong broth (such as beef or vegetable broth)
- 2-3 anchovies
- 2-3 whole onions
- Grated nutmeg
- Thyme
- 3-4 egg yolks
- Sippets (small pieces of toasted bread)
- Lemon or barberries (for garnish)

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F).
2. Lard the mutton neck by inserting strips of lemon peel into the meat.
3. In a large pot, bring water to a boil and add salt and the bunch of sweet herbs.
4. Place the larded mutton neck into the pot and boil it for about 1 hour or until tender.
5. While the mutton is boiling, prepare the oyster stew. In a separate pot, combine the oysters, white wine, strong broth, oyster liquor, anchovies, whole onions, grated nutmeg, and thyme.
6. Simmer the oyster stew mixture over low heat for about 15 minutes, until the flavors meld together.
7. In a small bowl, take a little bit of the broth from the oyster stew and whisk in the egg yolks to thicken the mixture.
8. Remove the mutton neck from the pot and let it rest for a few minutes.
9. Slice the mutton neck into serving portions and place them on a serving dish.
10. Arrange the sippets around the mutton.
11. Pour the oyster stew over the mutton and sippets.
12. Garnish the dish with lemon slices or barberries.
