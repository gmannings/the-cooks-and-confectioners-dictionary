# Savoy Biscuits

## Description
Savoy Biscuits are a type of sweet, sponge-like cake that originated in the 18th century. They are made with eggs, sugar, flour, and flavored with orange-flower or rose water. These biscuits are light and delicate, perfect for enjoying with tea or as a sweet treat.

## Ingredients:
- 6 eggs (leave out 3 of the egg whites)
- 3 tablespoons orange-flower or rose water
- 450 grams double-refined sugar, finely beaten and sifted
- 450 grams fine flour, dried

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 160°C (320°F).
2. In a large bowl, whisk together the eggs, leaving out half of the egg whites.
3. Add the orange-flower or rose water to the eggs and continue whisking.
4. Gradually sprinkle in the finely beaten and sifted sugar while whisking, until the mixture becomes thick and white like cream.
5. Add the dried fine flour to the mixture and gently fold it in until well combined.
6. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
7. Take a portion of the dough and shape it into a long cake shape on the prepared baking sheet. Repeat with the remaining dough, leaving some space between each cake.
8. Place the baking sheet in the preheated oven and bake for approximately 20-25 minutes, or until the biscuits are lightly golden and spring back when touched.
9. Remove the biscuits from the oven and let them cool completely on a wire rack.
10. Once cooled, the Savoy Biscuits are ready to be enjoyed.
