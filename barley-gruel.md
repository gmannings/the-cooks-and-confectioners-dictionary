# Barley Gruel

## Description
Barley gruel is a comforting and nourishing dish made with pearl barley, currants, eggs, white wine, cream, lemon peel, and sugar. It has a creamy texture and a slightly sweet taste. This dish can be enjoyed as a warm breakfast or a light dessert.

## Options and commentary
- You can adjust the sweetness of the gruel by adding more or less sugar according to your taste.
- If you prefer a non-alcoholic version, you can substitute the white wine with apple juice or grape juice.
- Feel free to add a pinch of ground cinnamon or nutmeg for extra flavor.

## Ingredients:
- 85 grams pearl barley
- 1 liter water
- 60 grams currants
- 3 egg yolks
- 120 ml white wine
- 120 ml thick cream
- Peel of 1 lemon
- Sugar, to taste

## Instructions:
1. Rinse the pearl barley under cold water to remove any impurities.
2. In a large saucepan, combine the rinsed barley and water. Bring to a boil over medium heat.
3. Reduce the heat to low and simmer the barley for about 45 minutes, or until it is tender.
4. While the barley is cooking, place the currants in a small bowl and cover them with warm water. Let them soak for about 10 minutes to plump them up.
5. Once the barley is cooked, strain it through a fine-mesh sieve, discarding the cooking liquid. Rinse the barley under cold water to cool it down.
6. In a clean saucepan, combine the cooked barley, plumped currants, egg yolks, white wine, thick cream, and lemon peel.
7. Place the saucepan over low heat and stir gently until the mixture thickens to the consistency of cream. This should take about 10-15 minutes.
8. Remove the saucepan from the heat and discard the lemon peel.
9. Sweeten the gruel with sugar, adding it gradually and tasting as you go until it reaches your desired level of sweetness.
10. Serve the barley gruel warm in bowls or mugs.
