# Pullet Pie

## Description
Pullet Pie is a traditional dish made with young chickens (pullets) that are seasoned, placed in a pie crust, and baked until golden and delicious. The chicken is flavored with a combination of salt, pepper, spices, onions, herbs, and parsley. The pie is then topped with slices of butter and bacon for added richness.

## Ingredients:
- 2 pullets (young chickens)
- Thick lardons of bacon (approximately 100g)
- Salt, to taste
- Pepper, to taste
- Spice (such as nutmeg or allspice), to taste
- 2 young onions, finely chopped
- Fresh sweet herbs (such as thyme, rosemary, or sage), finely chopped
- Fresh parsley, finely chopped
- Pie crust (store-bought or homemade)
- Butter, sliced
- Thin slices of bacon
- 1 or 2 bay leaves

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 180째C (350째F).

2. Truss the pullets by tying their legs together with kitchen twine. This will help them cook evenly.

3. Break the bones of the pullets by gently cracking them with a heavy knife or cleaver. This will allow the flavors to penetrate the meat.

4. Lard the pullets by inserting thick lardons of bacon into the meat. Make small incisions in the skin and push the bacon into the cuts.

5. Season the pullets with salt, pepper, spice, chopped onions, sweet herbs, and parsley. Rub the seasoning mixture all over the pullets, ensuring they are well coated.

6. Roll out the pie crust and line a pie dish with it. Place the seasoned pullets in the pie dish.

7. Layer slices of butter over the pullets, followed by thin slices of bacon. Place a bay leaf or two on top.

8. Cover the pie with another layer of pie crust, sealing the edges well. Cut a few slits in the top crust to allow steam to escape during baking.

9. Bake the pullet pie in the preheated oven for approximately 1 hour, or until the crust is golden brown and the pullets are cooked through. The internal temperature of the chicken should reach 75째C (165째F).

10. Remove the pie from the oven and let it cool for a few minutes before serving.
