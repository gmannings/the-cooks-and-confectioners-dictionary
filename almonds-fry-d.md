# Almonds Fry'd

## Description
This recipe is for making fried almonds, which are a sweet and crunchy treat. The almonds are coated in a syrup made from sugar and orange flower water, then fried until they become crispy. The frying process also helps to bring out the natural oils in the almonds, giving them a rich flavor.

## Ingredients:
- 200g Jordan almonds
- 200g granulated sugar
- 2 tablespoons orange flower water

## Instructions:
1. In a saucepan, combine the sugar and orange flower water. Stir until the sugar is dissolved.
2. Place the saucepan over medium heat and bring the mixture to a boil. Cook for about 5 minutes, or until the syrup reaches a candy-like consistency.
3. Add the almonds to the syrup and stir to coat them evenly. Continue cooking over medium heat, stirring constantly, until the syrup has dried and the almonds are coated in a candy-like coating.
4. Transfer the almonds to a dish and allow them to cool slightly.
5. Remove any knobs or loose bits from the almonds.
6. Return the almonds to the saucepan and place it over low heat. Allow the almonds to cook until some of their oil starts to come out and collect at the bottom of the pan. This will give the almonds a richer flavor.
7. Remove the almonds from the heat and let them cool completely.
8. Serve the fried almonds as a sweet and crunchy snack.
