# Pickled Pigeons

## Description
This recipe is for pickling pigeons, a method of preserving and flavoring the meat. The pigeons are seasoned with salt, pepper, mace, and cloves, then simmered in a mixture of water, white wine, and wine vinegar. The pickling liquid is infused with lemon peel and sweet herbs, giving the pigeons a tangy and aromatic flavor.

## Ingredients:
- 4 pigeons
- Salt
- Pepper
- Mace
- Cloves
- 1 quart (950 ml) water
- 1/2 pint (240 ml) white wine
- 1/2 pint (240 ml) wine vinegar
- 1 small piece of lemon peel
- 1 bunch of sweet herbs (such as thyme, rosemary, and parsley)

## Instructions:
1. Bone the pigeons carefully, removing the bones from the meat.
2. Season the pigeons with salt, pepper, mace, and cloves, ensuring they are evenly coated.
3. Sew up the back of each pigeon to close the cavity, and tie the rump and neck with kitchen twine to secure the shape.
4. In a large pot or pipkin, combine the water, white wine, and wine vinegar. Adjust the quantities of liquid based on the number of pigeons you are pickling.
5. Add the lemon peel and sweet herbs to the pot.
6. Place the pot on the stove and bring the liquid to a boil.
7. Once boiling, carefully add the pigeons to the pot.
8. Reduce the heat to a simmer and cook the pigeons until they are cooked through and tender. This will take approximately 45 minutes to 1 hour, depending on the size of the pigeons.
9. Once the pigeons are cooked, remove them from the pot and set them aside to cool.
10. Skim any impurities or foam from the pickling liquid to ensure it is clean.
11. Transfer the pigeons to a shallow pan or container.
12. Allow the pickling liquid to cool completely, then pour it over the pigeons, ensuring they are fully submerged.
13. Cover the pan or container and refrigerate the pickled pigeons for at least 24 hours to allow the flavors to develop.
14. Serve the pickled pigeons cold as a flavorful and preserved meat option.

## Cooking time
Approximately 45 minutes to 1 hour (depending on the size of the pigeons) for cooking the pigeons, plus at least 24 hours for pickling.
