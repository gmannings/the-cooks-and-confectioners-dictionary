# Oxford Cake

## Description
Oxford Cake is a rich and flavorful fruit cake that originated in the 18th century. It is made with a combination of spices, dried fruits, butter, and other ingredients. The cake is moist and dense, with a slightly sweet and aromatic taste.

## Options and commentary
- You can adjust the amount of spices according to your taste preference.
- Instead of using a quart of cream, you can use a combination of milk and heavy cream.
- If you don't have ale yeast, you can use active dry yeast as a substitute.
- Ambergreese is a rare and expensive ingredient, so you can omit it if you can't find it.
- Instead of using rosewater for frosting, you can use a simple powdered sugar glaze or cream cheese frosting.

## Ingredients:
- 1.25 kg all-purpose flour
- 1 tablespoon salt
- 5 grams ground cloves
- 5 grams ground mace
- 2.5 grams ground nutmeg
- 5 grams ground cinnamon
- 750 grams granulated sugar
- 675 grams unsalted butter, softened
- 1 liter cream
- 500 ml ale yeast (or active dry yeast)
- 125 ml Canary wine (or any sweet white wine)
- 3 grains of ambergreese, dissolved in the yolks of 8 eggs and whites of 4 eggs
- 125 ml rosewater
- 500 grams raisins, stoned and minced
- 1.5 kg currants
- Fine sugar, for sprinkling

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 160Â°C.
2. In a large mixing bowl, combine the flour, salt, cloves, mace, nutmeg, cinnamon, and sugar. Mix well.
3. Add the softened butter to the flour mixture. Using your hands or a pastry cutter, work the butter into the flour until it resembles coarse crumbs. This may take about 10 minutes.
4. Pour in the cream, ale yeast, Canary wine, dissolved ambergreese, and rosewater. Mix well until all the ingredients are fully incorporated.
5. Add the raisins and currants to the dough. Knead the dough for about 5 minutes until the fruits are evenly distributed.
6. Place the dough near a warm area, such as the fireplace or a warm oven, and let it rest for about 30 minutes.
7. Shape the dough into a round cake and place it on a greased baking sheet or in a greased cake pan.
8. Bake the cake in the preheated oven for approximately 3 hours, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.
9. Remove the cake from the oven and let it cool completely on a wire rack.
10. In a small bowl, mix together rosewater and the white of an egg until well combined.
11. Brush the top of the cooled cake with the rosewater and egg mixture.
12. Sprinkle fine sugar over the top of the cake.
13. Place the cake back in the oven for a few minutes until the sugar forms a light crust.
14. Remove the cake from the oven and let it cool completely before serving.
