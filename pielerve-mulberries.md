# Pielerve Mulberries

## Description
Pielerve Mulberries is a method of preserving mulberries by cooking them in a sugar syrup and then drying them. The result is a sweet and tart dried fruit that can be enjoyed as a snack or used in various recipes.

## Ingredients:
- Mulberries (not overripe, slightly greenish and tart)
- Sugar

## Instructions:
1. In a preserving pan, melt the sugar with the juice of mulberries to clarify it. Use an equal amount of sugar to the weight of the mulberries.
2. Add the mulberries to the sugar syrup in the pan.
3. Cover the preserving pan and bring the mixture to a boil. Let it boil for a short time.
4. Remove the pan from heat and skim off any foam that forms on the surface.
5. Place the pan in a stove or oven and let it sit overnight.
6. The next day, remove the pan from the stove and let it cool.
7. Drain the syrup from the mulberries.
8. Prepare slates or baking sheets by sprinkling them with sugar.
9. Arrange the mulberries on the slates, making sure they are spread out and not touching each other.
10. Place the slates in a stove or oven to dry the mulberries. The drying process may take several hours or even a day, depending on the moisture content of the mulberries.
11. Periodically turn the mulberries on the slates to ensure even drying.
12. Once the mulberries are thoroughly dry and no longer sticky, remove them from the slates.
13. Store the dried mulberries in boxes or airtight containers to keep them fresh.

## Cooking time
The cooking time for this recipe will vary depending on the drying process. It may take several hours or even a day to dry the mulberries completely.
