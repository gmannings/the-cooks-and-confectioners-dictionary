# Eel-Powt Pie

## Description
Eel-Powt Pie is a traditional British dish made with eel and a variety of other ingredients. The eel is seasoned with its own roe, liver, and tails of crayfish, along with oysters, mushrooms, and artichoke bottoms. The pie is then baked until golden and served with a squeeze of lemon juice.

## Ingredients:
- 1 sheet of puff pastry
- 500g eel fillets, skinned
- 100g eel roe
- 100g eel liver
- 100g crayfish tails
- 100g oysters
- 100g mushrooms, sliced
- 100g artichoke bottoms, chopped
- Salt, to taste
- Pepper, to taste
- Nutmeg, to taste
- 1 bunch of chives, chopped
- A handful of fresh herbs (such as parsley, thyme, and rosemary), chopped
- Juice of 1 lemon

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F).
2. Roll out the puff pastry and line a pie dish with it, leaving some excess pastry hanging over the edges.
3. In a bowl, combine the eel roe, liver, crayfish tails, oysters, mushrooms, and artichoke bottoms.
4. Season the mixture with salt, pepper, nutmeg, chives, and fresh herbs. Mix well to combine.
5. Place the seasoned mixture on top of the puff pastry in the pie dish.
6. Fold the excess pastry over the filling to create a lid for the pie. Seal the edges by pressing them together with a fork.
7. Make a small slit in the center of the pie to allow steam to escape during baking.
8. Place the pie in the preheated oven and bake for approximately 45 minutes, or until the pastry is golden brown and crispy.
9. Remove the pie from the oven and let it cool slightly.
10. Squeeze the juice of one lemon over the top of the pie before serving.
