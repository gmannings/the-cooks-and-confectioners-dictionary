# Snail Pottage

## Description
Snail Pottage is a traditional dish made with snails, herbs, and spices. It is a hearty and flavorful stew that was popular in the 18th century. This recipe provides instructions on how to prepare the snails and create a rich potage with a green sauce.

## Ingredients:
- 1 pound snails (modern alternative: canned or frozen snails)
- Water
- Salt
- Sallet oil (modern alternative: olive oil)
- Slices of lemon
- Thyme
- Parsley
- Pennyroyal (modern alternative: mint)
- Other sweet herbs (e.g., basil, tarragon)
- Bread crumbs
- Cloves
- Saffron
- Lemon juice
- Vinegar
- Garlic
- Sippets (small pieces of toasted bread)

## Instructions:
1. If using fresh snails, wash them thoroughly in several changes of water to remove any dirt or debris. If using canned or frozen snails, skip this step.
2. Place the snails in an earthen pan and pour enough water to cover them.
3. Set the pan over a chafing dish of coals or use a stovetop burner on low heat. Bring the water to a boil and cook the snails until they are tender. This may take about 20-30 minutes for fresh snails or follow the instructions on the canned or frozen snails packaging.
4. Once cooked, remove the snails from their shells and rinse them with salt and water several times to clean them thoroughly.
5. Transfer the cleaned snails to a pipkin or a small saucepan. Add water and salt to the pan and boil the snails for a few minutes to further enhance their flavor.
6. In a separate frying pan, heat sallet oil (or olive oil) and fry the slices of lemon until they are lightly browned.
7. Add the fried lemon slices to the pan with the snails.
8. Add the thyme, parsley, pennyroyal (or mint), and other sweet herbs to the pan. Shred them finely.
9. In a mortar, pound the shredded herbs together with bread crumbs soaked in some of the potage to create a green sauce.
10. Add beaten cloves and saffron to the green sauce and mix well.
11. Pour the green sauce into the pan with the snails and herbs. Stir to combine.
12. Add enough warm water to the pan to create a potage-like consistency. Season with a little salt.
13. Let the snails and potage stew together for three to four hours on low heat, stirring occasionally.
14. In a small bowl, mix lemon juice and vinegar. Add a clove of garlic and crush it into the mixture.
15. Just before serving, squeeze the lemon-garlic mixture into the potage and stir well.
16. Arrange sippets in a serving dish and pour the potage over them.
17. Serve the Snail Pottage hot.
