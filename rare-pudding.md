## Ingredients:
- 250g almonds
- Rosewater
- 5 egg yolks
- 2 egg whites
- 250g beef suet, minced very fine
- Cream
- Salt
- Sugar
- Mace

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F) if you choose to bake the pudding. If you prefer to boil it, skip this step.
2. In a food processor or blender, grind the almonds until they are very fine.
3. In a mixing bowl, combine the ground almonds with a splash of rosewater and enough cream to make a thin batter-like consistency.
4. Separate the eggs, placing the yolks in a separate bowl and the whites in another bowl.
5. Add the yolks to the almond mixture and mix well.
6. Add the minced beef suet to the mixture and stir until well combined.
7. Gradually add more cream to the mixture until it reaches a thin batter-like consistency.
8. Season the mixture with a pinch of salt, sugar, and mace. Adjust the amount of sugar and spices according to your taste.
9. If you choose to bake the pudding, pour the mixture into a greased baking dish and smooth the top. Bake in the preheated oven for approximately 45 minutes, or until the pudding is set and golden brown on top.
10. If you prefer to boil the pudding, pour the mixture into a greased pudding mold or a heatproof bowl. Cover the mold or bowl with a lid or aluminum foil.
11. Place the mold or bowl in a large pot and fill the pot with enough water to reach halfway up the sides of the mold or bowl.
12. Bring the water to a boil, then reduce the heat to a simmer. Steam the pudding for approximately 2 hours, or until it is set and cooked through.
13. Once the pudding is cooked, remove it from the oven or pot and let it cool slightly.
14. Sprinkle sugar over the top of the pudding.
15. Serve the pudding warm or at room temperature.
