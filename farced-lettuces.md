# Farced Lettuces

## Description
Farced lettuces are a dish made with stuffed lettuce leaves that are braised in a flavorful broth. The stuffing is made with minced roasted capons and chickens, boiled gammon, mushrooms, herbs, bread soaked in cream, eggs, and bacon. The lettuces are filled with the stuffing, tied up, and then cooked in a stewpan with bacon, veal, onions, and a variety of seasonings. The dish can be served with a white sauce or a brown sauce made with the essence of ham. For a more decadent option, it can be served with a ragout of truffles and mushrooms.

## Options and commentary
- Instead of capons and chickens, you can use roasted chicken or turkey.
- If gammon is not available, you can use cooked ham.
- Any type of mushrooms can be used, such as button mushrooms or cremini mushrooms.
- For the herbs, you can use a combination of parsley, thyme, and rosemary.
- Instead of a French roll, you can use breadcrumbs.
- Instead of soaking the breadcrumbs in cream, you can use milk or vegetable broth.
- If you prefer a vegetarian version, you can omit the meat and use vegetable broth instead of the broth and gravy.
- For the white sauce, you can use a béchamel sauce or a velouté sauce.
- The ragout of truffles and mushrooms can be made by sautéing sliced mushrooms and truffles in butter and then simmering them in a rich sauce made with cream, white wine, and vegetable broth.

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 180°C.
2. Bring a pot of water to a boil and blanch the cabbage lettuce leaves for 2 minutes. Drain and set aside.
3. In a large bowl, combine the minced roasted chicken or turkey, minced ham, chopped mushrooms, savory herbs, soaked French roll or breadcrumbs, cream, beaten eggs, and crumbled bacon. Season with salt and pepper. Mix well until all the ingredients are combined.
4. Take one blanched cabbage lettuce leaf at a time, open the leaves, and cut out the knob in the middle.
5. Fill the hollow of each lettuce leaf with the minced meat and seasoning mixture. Tie each filled lettuce leaf with kitchen twine to secure the stuffing.
6. In a stewpan, arrange slices of bacon and veal at the bottom. Add sliced onions on top. Cover the pan and place it over medium heat.
7. When the bacon starts to stick to the pan, add flour and stir with a spoon to brown it.
8. Moisten the mixture with an equal quantity of broth and gravy. Season with salt, pepper, cloves, a whole leek, parsley, basil, and a bay leaf.
9. Place the stuffed lettuces in the stewpan and pour the braising liquid over them.
10. Cover the stewpan and let the lettuces simmer for about 1 hour, or until they are cooked through and tender.
11. Once the lettuces are cooked, remove them from the stewpan and untie them. Drain any excess liquid.
12. If serving with a white sauce, melt butter in a saucepan over medium heat. Stir in flour and cook for 1 minute. Gradually whisk in milk and cook until the sauce thickens. Season with salt and pepper.
13. If serving with a brown sauce, add the essence of ham to the braising liquid and simmer for a few minutes.
14. If serving with a ragout of truffles and mushrooms, melt butter in a separate pan over medium heat. Add sliced mushrooms and truffles and sauté until they are
