# Eggs Poached with Cream

## Description
This recipe is a simple and delicious way to enjoy poached eggs. The eggs are poached in butter, then served with a creamy sauce made with cream, sugar, and a touch of salt. The dish can be garnished according to your preference and is best served hot.

## Ingredients:
- 4 eggs
- 2 tablespoons butter
- 1/4 cup cream
- 1 tablespoon sugar
- 1/4 teaspoon salt
- Garnish of your choice (e.g., chopped herbs, grated cheese, or paprika)

## Instructions:
1. Fill a large saucepan with water and bring it to a gentle simmer over medium heat.
2. Crack each egg into a separate small bowl or ramekin.
3. Melt the butter in a separate frying pan over medium heat.
4. Carefully slide each egg into the simmering water, one at a time, making sure to keep the yolks intact.
5. Poach the eggs for about 3-4 minutes, or until the whites are set but the yolks are still runny. Use a slotted spoon to carefully remove the poached eggs from the water and transfer them to a plate.
6. Trim the whites of the poached eggs by carefully cutting off any uneven edges.
7. In a small saucepan, heat the cream over low heat until warm.
