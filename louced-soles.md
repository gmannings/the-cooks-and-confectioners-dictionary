# Louced Soles

## Description
Louced Soles is a traditional Scottish dish made with boiled soles in a flavorful broth. The fish is cooked in a mixture of white wine, wine vinegar, spices, and herbs, which infuses it with a delicious taste. The dish is then allowed to cool, allowing the flavors to meld together.

## Ingredients:
- 4 sole fillets
- 500 ml white wine
- 250 ml wine vinegar
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 1 teaspoon sliced ginger
- 4 cloves
- 1 teaspoon ground mace
- 1 onion, sliced
- 1 teaspoon dried winter savory
- 1 teaspoon dried sweet marjoram
- 1 teaspoon dried rosemary
- 1 teaspoon dried sage
- 1 teaspoon dried thyme
- 1 tablespoon chopped parsley

## Instructions:
1. In a large pot, combine the white wine, wine vinegar, salt, sliced ginger, cloves, and ground mace. Bring the mixture to a boil.
2. Add the sole fillets to the boiling liquid and cook for about 5 minutes, or until the fish is cooked through and opaque.
3. Remove the cooked sole fillets from the pot and set them aside to cool.
4. Add the sliced onion, dried winter savory, dried sweet marjoram, dried rosemary, dried sage, dried thyme, and chopped parsley to the pot. Simmer the mixture for an additional 10 minutes to infuse the flavors.
5. Once the broth has cooled, strain it to remove the spices and herbs.
6. Place the cooked sole fillets in a shallow dish and pour the strained broth over them.
7. Cover the dish and refrigerate for at least 2 hours, or until the fish is thoroughly chilled and the flavors have melded together.
8. Serve the Louced Soles cold, garnished with fresh herbs if desired.
