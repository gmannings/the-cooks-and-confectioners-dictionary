# Roasted Veal with Oysters and Bacon

## Description
This recipe is for a roasted veal dish that is flavored with thyme and served with a sauce made from oysters, bacon, and wine. The veal is first roasted with a mixture of herbs and then skewered with oysters and bacon. The dish is finished by making a sauce from the drippings, wine, and egg yolk, which is poured over the veal before serving.

## Ingredients:
- 1 pork loin
- Thyme
- Large oysters
- Winter savory
- Parsley
- 4 hard-boiled eggs
- Bacon
- Square sticks (about the size of a little finger)
- Claret (red wine)
- Grated nutmeg
- 1 egg yolk

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to the desired temperature for roasting the veal.
2. Rub the veal with thyme to season it.
3. Spit the veal and roast it in the preheated oven until it is about three-quarters cooked.
4. While the veal is roasting, parboil the oysters.
5. In a bowl, combine the parboiled oysters, winter savory, thyme, parsley, and minced hard-boiled eggs.
6. Cut the bacon into square pieces slightly larger than the oysters.
7. Skewer the oysters and bacon onto the square sticks, alternating between the two ingredients.
8. Tie the skewers to the veal.
9. In a dish, mix claret, minced thyme, and grated nutmeg.
10. When the veal is ready, remove the skewers and transfer the oysters and bacon into the dish with the wine mixture.
11. Place the oysters and bacon into a small pot or pipkin.
12. Add the yolk of an egg to the pot to thicken the sauce.
13. Remove the veal from the spit and transfer it to a serving dish.
14. Pour the oyster and bacon sauce over the veal.
15. Serve the roasted veal with the oyster and bacon sauce.

## Cooking time
Approximately 1-2 hours, depending on the size of the veal loin and desired level of doneness.
