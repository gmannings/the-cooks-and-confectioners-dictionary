# Duck with Turnips

## Description
This recipe is for a classic dish of duck cooked with turnips. The duck is first larded and then browned in bacon fat. It is then stewed in a flavorful sauce made with white wine, broth, herbs, onions, and lemon slices. The turnips are cut into olive or dice shapes, browned in lard, and then simmered in a gravy thickened with a cullis. The duck is served with the ragout of turnips poured over it.

## Ingredients:
- 1 duck
- Bacon fat or melted butter
- Flour
- 1 pint white wine
- Good broth
- Pepper
- Salt
- Cloves
- Sweet herbs (such as thyme, rosemary, or sage)

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F).
2. Lard the duck by inserting strips of bacon fat into the meat.
3. Dust the duck with flour, making sure to coat it evenly.
4. Heat a large skillet over medium heat and add the melted bacon fat or butter.
5. Place the duck in the skillet and cook until browned on all sides.
6. Transfer the duck to a pot or casserole dish.
7. In the same skillet, make a brown sauce by melting more bacon fat or butter and adding flour to create a roux. Cook the roux until it turns a golden brown color.

12. Cover the pot or casserole dish and place it in the preheated oven.
13. Cook the duck for about 2 hours, or until it is tender and cooked through.
14. While the duck is cooking, prepare the turnips by cutting them into olive or dice shapes.
15. Heat a skillet over medium heat and add the hogs lard or vegetable oil.
16. Brown the turnips in the skillet until they are golden and crispy.
17. Remove the turnips from the skillet and place them on a paper towel to drain excess oil.
18. In a separate saucepan, heat the good gravy and thicken it with a cullis.
19. Add the browned turnips to the gravy and simmer until they are cooked through and tender.
20. Once the duck is cooked, remove it from the oven and transfer it to a serving dish.
21. Pour the ragout of turnips over the duck.
