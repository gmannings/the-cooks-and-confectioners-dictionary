# Raspberry Jelly

## Description
This recipe is for making a delicious raspberry jelly. It involves extracting the juice from ripe raspberries and boiling it with sugar to create a sweet and tangy jelly.

## Ingredients:
- 500g raspberries
- 500g sugar

## Instructions:
1. Place the raspberries in a preserving pan and heat them over low heat. 
2. Use a spoon or spatula to gently mash the raspberries as they heat up. 
3. Continue heating and mashing the raspberries until they release their juice. 
4. Once the raspberries have released their juice, remove the pan from the heat and allow it to cool slightly. 
5. Place a fine strainer over a clean bowl and pour the raspberry mixture into the strainer. Use the back of a spoon to press the raspberries and extract as much juice as possible. 
6. Discard the raspberry pulp left in the strainer. 
7. Measure the amount of raspberry juice you have obtained and add an equal amount of sugar to the pan. 
8. Return the pan to the heat and bring the raspberry juice and sugar mixture to a boil. 
9. Stir the mixture constantly to ensure the sugar dissolves completely. 
10. Continue boiling the mixture until it reaches the setting point. This can be tested by placing a small amount of the jelly on a chilled plate and checking if it wrinkles when pushed with a finger. 
11. Once the jelly has reached the setting point, remove the pan from the heat and allow it to cool slightly. 
12. Carefully pour the hot jelly into sterilized jars, leaving a small amount of headspace at the top. 
13. Seal the jars tightly and allow the jelly to cool completely before storing in a cool, dark place.
