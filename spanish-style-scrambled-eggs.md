# Spanish-Style Scrambled Eggs

## Description
This recipe is a modern adaptation of an 18th-century recipe for scrambled eggs with a Spanish twist. The eggs are mixed with sugar, nutmeg, orange juice, and fortified wine, then cooked over gentle heat until thickened. They are served with toasted bread and a sprinkle of orange juice for a refreshing and unique flavor.

## Ingredients:
- 18 eggs
- 100 grams of sugar
- 60 ml of fortified wine (such as sherry or port)
- A pinch of salt
- A pinch of grated nutmeg
- Juice of 1 orange
- 4 slices of bread
- White wine or claret (optional)
- Scraped sugar (optional)

## Instructions:
1. In a large bowl, break the eggs and add the sugar, fortified wine, salt, grated nutmeg, and juice of 1 orange. Beat them together until well combined.
2. Place a large non-stick skillet or frying pan over low heat.
3. Pour the egg mixture into the skillet and start stirring continuously with a wooden spoon or spatula.
4. Keep stirring the eggs gently and continuously until they begin to thicken. This process may take about 10-15 minutes.
5. While the eggs are cooking, toast the bread slices until golden brown.
6. Once the eggs have thickened to your desired consistency (similar to scrambled eggs), remove the skillet from the heat.
7. Serve the scrambled eggs in a dish alongside the toasted bread slices.
8. If desired, dip the toasted bread in the juice of oranges, white wine, or claret before placing it on the dish.
9. Sprinkle some scraped sugar over the scrambled eggs.
10. Finally, sprinkle some additional orange juice over the eggs for added flavor.
11. Serve immediately and enjoy!
