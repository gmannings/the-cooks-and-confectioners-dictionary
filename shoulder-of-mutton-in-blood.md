# Shoulder of Mutton in Blood

## Description
This recipe involves marinating a shoulder of mutton in sheep's blood before stuffing it with herbs and roasting it. The dish is then served with either venison or anchovy sauce.

## Options and commentary
- If sheep's blood is not available or not desired, you can substitute it with red wine or beef broth for marinating the mutton.
- The choice of sauce, either venison or anchovy, depends on personal preference and availability of ingredients.
- Cooking time may vary depending on the size and thickness of the shoulder of mutton.

## Ingredients:
- 1 shoulder of mutton
- Sheep's blood (or substitute with red wine or beef broth)
- Fresh herbs (such as rosemary, thyme, and parsley)
- Salt and pepper
- Venison sauce or anchovy sauce (for serving)

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to the appropriate temperature for roasting mutton (usually around 180°C or 350°F).
2. In a large bowl, pour the sheep's blood (or substitute) and place the shoulder of mutton in it. Allow the mutton to soak in the blood for 5 to 6 hours.
3. Remove the mutton from the blood and pat it dry with paper towels.
4. Preheat a roasting pan on the stovetop over medium heat.
5. Stuff the shoulder of mutton with fresh herbs, such as rosemary, thyme, and parsley. Season with salt and pepper.
6. Place the stuffed mutton in the preheated roasting pan and sear it on all sides until browned.
7. Transfer the mutton to a roasting rack set inside a roasting pan.
8. Sprinkle the mutton with a little more blood (or substitute) to enhance the color.
9. Place the roasting pan with the mutton in the preheated oven.
10. Roast the mutton for the appropriate amount of time based on its weight and desired doneness. As a general guideline, roast the mutton for about 20 minutes per pound (450 grams) for medium-rare.
11. While the mutton is roasting, prepare the chosen sauce (venison or anchovy) according to the recipe or using a store-bought version.
12. Once the mutton is cooked to your desired doneness, remove it from the oven and let it rest for a few minutes before carving.
13. Serve the shoulder of mutton with the prepared venison or anchovy sauce.

## Cooking time
The cooking time will vary depending on the size and desired doneness of the shoulder of mutton. As a general guideline, roast the mutton for about 20 minutes per pound (450 grams) for medium-rare.
