# Tobrew Ale, or Beer

## Description
This recipe is for brewing ale or beer using traditional methods from the 18th century. It involves mashing malt with hot water, fermenting the mixture, and boiling it with hops to create the desired flavor. The recipe provides options for brewing beer, ale, or table beer.

## Options and commentary
- The recipe mentions using a "Hogshead" of water, which is a large barrel. For modern home brewing, you can use a large pot or kettle to hold the water.
- "Bran" is mentioned as a covering for the water. This may have been used to help maintain the temperature. In modern brewing, you can use a lid or cover for the pot.
- The recipe mentions using "Bufhels" of malt. A bushel is a unit of volume, but for modern brewing, it is more common to measure malt by weight. You can use approximately 25 kilograms of malt for each bushel mentioned in the recipe.
- The recipe suggests using hot coals to remove any unpleasant flavors from the malt. This step can be skipped in modern brewing as malt is typically processed differently and does not require this treatment.
- The recipe provides instructions for brewing beer, ale, and table beer. The main difference is the amount of hops used and the boiling time. Adjust the amount of hops and boiling time according to your preference.

## Ingredients:
- 1 Hogshead (large pot or kettle) of water
- Bran or a lid to cover the pot
- 2 bushels (approximately 50 kilograms) of malt
- Hot coals (optional)
- 1 pound (454 grams) of hops for beer
- 6 ounces (170 grams) of hops for ale
- Additional water for brewing table beer

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the hogshead of water in a large pot or kettle. Cover it with a lid or bran.
2. Once the water is scalding hot, transfer one-third of it into a mashing tub. Allow it to stand until the steam has dissipated and you can see your face in the liquid.
3. Stir in 2 bushels (approximately 50 kilograms) of malt into the mashing tub, ensuring the malt and water are well combined.
4. While the malt is mashing, boil the remaining water in the large pot or kettle.
5. Extinguish the fire under the pot to reduce the heat. This will help to cool down the water.
6. Transfer the remaining hot water into the mashing tub, stirring it well with the malt mixture.
7. Optional: Add a shovel or two of hot coals to remove any unpleasant flavors from the malt. Stir again.
8. Allow the mixture to stand for 2 hours.
9. While the mixture is standing, heat another half hogshead of water.
10. After 2 hours, draw off the first wort from the mashing tub. Pour part of it onto the grains and stir in 1.5 bushels (approximately 37.5 kilograms) of fresh malt.
11. Pour the rest of the first wort into the large pot or kettle, making it scalding hot.
12. Transfer part of the scalding hot first wort into a second mashing tub. Allow the steam to dissipate and stir in 1.5 bushels (approximately 37.5 kilograms) of fresh malt.
13. Pour the remaining first wort into the second mashing tub and stir well. Allow it to stand for 2 hours.
14. Heat another half hogshead of water and pour it onto the grains in the first mashing tub. Allow it to stand as before.
15. Boil the first wort with 1 pound (454 grams) of hops for 2 hours to create beer.
16. Boil the second wort with 6 ounces (170 grams) of hops for 1.5 hours to create ale.
17. Boil the hops from both worts in the additional water for 1.5 hours to create table beer.
