# Cochineal Tincture

## Description
This recipe is for making a cochineal tincture, which was commonly used as a red food coloring in the 18th century. Cochineal is a type of insect that produces a vibrant red dye. This tincture can be used to add color to various dishes and beverages.

## Ingredients:
- 2 grams cochineal powder
- 2 grams myrrh powder
- 2 grams hiera-picra powder
- 2 liters aniseed water

## Instructions:
1. In a mortar and pestle, combine the cochineal, myrrh, and hiera-picra powders. Grind them together until they form a fine powder.
2. In a large jar or container, pour the aniseed water.
3. Add the powdered mixture to the aniseed water and stir well to combine.
4. Close the jar or container tightly to prevent any air from entering.
5. Place the jar in a sunny spot, such as a windowsill, and shake it every so often to help the powders dissolve. If it is winter or there is no sunlight available, place the jar near a heat source, such as a fireplace or radiator.
6. Allow the mixture to steep for several days, shaking it occasionally.
7. After the steeping period, strain the tincture through a fine-mesh sieve or cheesecloth to remove any solids.
8. Transfer the tincture to a clean bottle or container with a tight-fitting lid.
9. The cochineal tincture is now ready to use.

## Cooking time
Several days for steeping
