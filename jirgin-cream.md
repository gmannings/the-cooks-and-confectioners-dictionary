# Jirgin Cream

## Description
Jirgin Cream is a creamy and sweet dessert that was popular in the 18th century. It is made by thickening a mixture of eggs, milk, sugar, and orange-flower water, and then browning it on top with a red hot fire-shovel. The result is a delicious and lightly caramelized custard-like dessert.

## Ingredients:
- 5 egg whites
- 500 ml milk
- 100 g sugar
- 1 tsp orange-flower water
- 1/2 tsp ground cinnamon

## Instructions:
1. In a mixing bowl, whisk the egg whites until they form stiff peaks.
2. In a saucepan, combine the milk, sugar, and orange-flower water. Heat the mixture over medium heat until it starts to simmer.
3. Slowly pour the hot milk mixture into the whisked egg whites, while continuously whisking to prevent the eggs from curdling.
4. Return the mixture to the saucepan and place it over low heat. Stir the mixture constantly until it thickens to a custard-like consistency. This should take about 10-15 minutes.
5. Meanwhile, sprinkle the ground cinnamon onto a plate and place it on the stovetop or a low heat source.
6. Once the cream has thickened, carefully pour it onto the cinnamon-covered plate. The heat from the plate will help brown the top of the cream.
7. Use a red hot fire-shovel or a kitchen blowtorch to further brown the top of the cream until it develops a caramelized crust.
8. Allow the Jirgin Cream to cool for a few minutes before serving.

## Cooking time
Approximately 20-25 minutes.
