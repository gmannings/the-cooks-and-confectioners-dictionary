# Norfolk White-pot

## Description
Norfolk White-pot is a traditional English dessert made with cream, eggs, and bread. It is a rich and creamy dish with a hint of spices and a sweet topping of sugar and dates.

## Ingredients:
- 750 ml cream
- 2-3 large mace blades
- 1 cinnamon stick
- 8 egg yolks
- 1 manchet bread (white bread loaf)
- Sliced dates
- Sugar for sprinkling

## Instructions:
1. In a saucepan, combine the cream, mace blades, and cinnamon stick. Bring to a boil over medium heat.
2. Once the cream has boiled for a while, remove the mace blades and cinnamon stick.
3. In a separate bowl, beat the egg yolks until well beaten.
4. Take the saucepan off the heat and gradually pour the beaten egg yolks into the hot cream, stirring continuously to prevent curdling.
5. Return the saucepan to low heat and cook the mixture, stirring constantly, until it thickens and coats the back of a spoon. This should take about 5-7 minutes. Do not let it boil.
6. Remove the saucepan from the heat and set aside.
7. Slice the manchet bread into thin slices.
8. Line the bottom of a dish with a layer of sliced bread.
9. Pour some of the cream mixture over the bread, covering it completely.
10. Repeat the layering process with more sliced bread and cream until the dish is full, ending with a layer of cream on top.
11. Trim the edges of the dish with finely carved sippets (small triangular pieces of bread).
12. Decorate the top of the dish with sliced dates.
13. Sprinkle sugar over the top of the dish.
14. Serve the Norfolk White-pot either warm or chilled.
