# Elder-flower Wine

## Description
Elder-flower wine is a sweet and floral alcoholic beverage made from elderflower blossoms. It has a light and refreshing taste, perfect for enjoying on a warm summer day.

## Ingredients:
- 4.5 kg of white granulated sugar
- 15 liters of water
- 1-2 tablespoons of active dry yeast
- 1.5 liters of elderflower blossoms, picked from the stalks

## Instructions:
1. In a large pot, combine the sugar and water. Heat the mixture over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until the sugar has completely dissolved.
2. Increase the heat to high and bring the mixture to a boil. Boil the mixture until approximately one-sixth of the liquid has evaporated. This will concentrate the flavors.
3. While the mixture is boiling, skim off any impurities or foam that rise to the surface.
4. Remove the pot from the heat and allow the mixture to cool to room temperature, similar to the temperature of wort.
5. Once the mixture has cooled, sprinkle the yeast over the surface. Let it sit for a few minutes to activate.
6. Add the elderflower blossoms to the pot and stir well to combine.
7. Cover the pot with a clean cloth or plastic wrap and let it sit at room temperature for about a week. Stir the mixture daily to ensure proper fermentation.
8. After a week, strain the mixture through a fine-mesh sieve or cheesecloth to remove the elderflower blossoms. Transfer the liquid to a clean and sterilized cask or fermentation vessel.
9. Seal the cask tightly and let it stand for two to three months in a cool and dark place. This will allow the wine to clarify and develop its flavors.
10. After the aging period, if the wine is clear and free from sediment, it is ready to be bottled. Use clean and sterilized bottles to store the wine.
11. Seal the bottles tightly and let them rest for a few more weeks to further develop the flavors. The wine can be enjoyed immediately, but it will continue to improve with additional aging.

## Cooking time
- Boiling the sugar and water mixture: approximately 1 hour
- Cooling and fermenting: 1 week
- Aging in the cask: 2-3 months
- Additional bottle aging: a few weeks
