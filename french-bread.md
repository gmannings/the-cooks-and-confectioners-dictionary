# French Bread

## Description
This recipe is for making French bread, a classic type of bread with a crispy crust and a soft, chewy interior.

## Options and commentary
- You can choose to use either the first recipe or the second recipe provided.
- The first recipe uses pork fat (veal suet) as an ingredient, which may not be readily available or preferred by some. In that case, you can substitute it with an equal amount of butter.
- The second recipe calls for a large quantity of eggs. If you prefer a less eggy taste, you can reduce the number of eggs used.
- The first recipe suggests washing the bread with an egg and milk mixture before baking, which gives it a shiny appearance. This step is optional.

## Ingredients:
### For the first recipe:
- 2.5 kg fine flour
- 3 eggs
- 170 g fresh butter
- 55 g pork fat (veal suet) or substitute with butter

4. Gradually add the warm milk and water to the dough, mixing well until it reaches the desired consistency.
5. Once the dough is well mixed, cover it with a warm cloth and let it rest in a bowl or tray.
