# Dressed Leg of Mutton a la Royale

## Description
This recipe is for a classic French dish called "Dressed Leg of Mutton a la Royale." It involves larding a leg of mutton with bacon and beef, seasoning it, and then cooking it in broth or water with onions and herbs. The dish is served with a ragout made from veal sweetbreads, truffles, mushrooms, artichoke bottoms, and asparagus tops, all in a rich sauce. It is a hearty and flavorful main course.

## Options and commentary
- Instead of mutton, you can use lamb or beef as a substitute.
- If you don't have access to veal sweetbreads, you can use chicken or pork sweetbreads as a substitute.
- Truffles can be quite expensive and hard to find, so you can omit them or use truffle oil for a similar flavor.
- If you can't find fresh asparagus, you can use frozen or canned asparagus.
- The cooking time may vary depending on the size and type of meat used, so it's important to check for doneness with a meat thermometer.

## Ingredients:
- 1 leg of mutton (or lamb/beef)
- Bacon, sliced into lardons
- 1 round piece of beef buttock (or veal leg), larded
- Salt and pepper, to taste
- Flour, for dredging
- Hogs lard or cooking oil, for browning
- Broth or water
- 1 onion, stuck with cloves
- Assorted sweet herbs (such as thyme, rosemary, and parsley)
- Veal sweetbreads
- Truffles (optional)
- Mushrooms, sliced
- Artichoke bottoms
- Asparagus tops
- Cullis (a rich sauce made from meat stock)

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F).
2. Remove the fat, flesh, and skin around the shank bone of the leg of mutton.
3. Lard the leg of mutton with the bacon lardons, ensuring they are evenly distributed.
4. Lard the round piece of beef buttock (or veal leg) in the same manner.
5. Season the larded meats with salt and pepper.
6. Dredge the meats with flour, shaking off any excess.
7. Heat the hogs lard or cooking oil in a large pot or Dutch oven over medium-high heat.
8. Brown the larded meats in the hot oil, turning them to ensure even browning.
9. Once browned, remove the meats from the pot and set them aside.
10. In the same pot, add enough broth or water to cover the meats.
11. Add the onion stuck with cloves and the assortment of sweet herbs to the pot.
12. Bring the liquid to a boil, then reduce the heat to low and cover the pot.
13. Simmer the meats in the broth or water for approximately 2 hours, or until they are tender and cooked through.
14. While the meats are simmering, prepare the ragout. 
15. In a separate pan, cook the veal sweetbreads until they are browned and cooked through.
16. Add the truffles (if using), mushrooms, artichoke bottoms, and asparagus tops to the pan with the sweetbreads.
17. Cook the vegetables until they are tender.
18. Prepare the cullis sauce by combining meat stock with a thickening agent (such as flour or cornstarch) and cooking it until it thickens.
19. Once the meats are cooked, remove them from the pot and slice them into serving portions.
20. Arrange the sliced meats on a serving platter, creating a rim around the mutton with the bacon and veal slices.
21. Pour the prepared ragout over the meats, ensuring it covers them evenly.
22. Serve the dressed leg of mutton a la Royale hot as the first course of a meal.

## Cooking time
Approximately 2 hours for simmering the meats, plus additional time for preparing the ragout and cullis sauce.
