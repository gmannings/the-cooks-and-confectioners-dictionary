# Modernized Beef Steaks

## Description
This recipe is a modernized version of an 18th-century recipe for beef steaks. The beef steaks are fried and then simmered in boiling water before being served. This method helps to tenderize the meat and infuse it with flavor.

## Options and commentary
- You can use any cut of beef steak that you prefer, such as sirloin, ribeye, or tenderloin.
- Feel free to season the beef steaks with salt, pepper, or any other desired spices before frying.
- You can also add some onions, garlic, or herbs to the boiling water for added flavor.

## Ingredients:

5. Pour off any excess butter or oil from the frying pan.
6. Return the frying pan to the heat and carefully pour in enough boiling water to cover the bottom of the pan.
