# Lemon Plate

## Description
Lemon Plate is a sweet confection made from boiled lemons and sugar. The lemons are boiled until tender, then mashed into a pulp and strained. The strained liquid is mixed with sugar and boiled until it reaches a candy-like consistency. The mixture is then spread thin on plates and dried in an oven. Once dried, it can be cut into various shapes.
