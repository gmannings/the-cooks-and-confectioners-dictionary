# Damson Wine

## Description
This recipe is for making damson wine, a sweet and fruity wine made from damson plums. The wine is fermented over a period of several months to develop its flavors and then aged in bottles for a year or two before drinking.

## Ingredients:
- 5 quarts (4.7 liters) of damsons
- 2 gallons (7.6 liters) of water
- 5 pounds (2.3 kilograms) of sugar

## Instructions:
1. Wash the damsons thoroughly and remove any stems or leaves.
2. Place the damsons in a large pot and add the water.
3. Bring the water to a boil and let the damsons simmer until the liquid turns a fine color. This may take about 30 minutes to an hour.
4. Once the liquid has reached the desired color, strain it through a sieve to remove the solids.
5. Transfer the strained liquid to an open vessel, such as a fermentation bucket or a large glass jar.
6. Allow the liquid to ferment in the open vessel for three to four days. During this time, the natural yeasts present on the fruit will start the fermentation process.
7. After three to four days, pour off the lees (sediment) that has settled at the bottom of the vessel.
8. Transfer the liquid back to the vessel and let it continue fermenting for as long as it will. This may take several weeks or even months.
9. Once the fermentation has stopped, the wine will become clear. At this point, it is ready to be bottled.
10. Carefully siphon the wine into clean, sterilized bottles, leaving behind any sediment at the bottom of the vessel.
11. Seal the bottles with corks or screw caps and store them in a cool, dark place for at least six months to a year. This aging process will allow the flavors to develop and the wine to become more refined.
12. After the recommended aging period, the damson wine is ready to be enjoyed. However, for the best results, it is recommended to let it age for an additional year or two before drinking.

## Cooking time
- Boiling the damsons: 30 minutes to 1 hour
- Fermentation: 3 to 4 days (open vessel), several weeks to months (closed vessel)
- Aging: 6 months to 2 years before drinking
