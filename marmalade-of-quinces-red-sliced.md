# Marmalade of Quinces Red, Sliced

## Description
This recipe is for making a bright red marmalade of quinces. The quinces are sliced and cooked in a quince liquor with sugar until they become jelly-like and turn a vibrant red color. The marmalade is then stored in glass jars.

## Options and commentary
- You can adjust the amount of sugar depending on your preference for sweetness.
- If you don't have quince liquor, you can use water or apple juice as a substitute.
- You can add spices like cinnamon or cloves for additional flavor.
- This marmalade can be used as a spread on toast, scones, or used as a filling for pastries.

## Ingredients:
- Quinces
- Fine sugar
- Quince liquor (or substitute with water or apple juice)

## Instructions:
1. Prepare the quinces by peeling and slicing them.
2. In a large pot, combine the quince liquor (or substitute) and sugar. Use 1 pound of sugar for every pint of quince liquor.
3. Add the quince slices to the pot, making sure they are fully submerged in the liquid.
4. Cover the pot tightly with a lid.
5. Place the pot on the stove over low heat and let it simmer gently until the quinces become jelly-like and turn a bright red color. This process may take several hours, so be patient.
6. Stir the mixture occasionally to prevent sticking or burning.
7. Once the quinces have reached the desired consistency and color, remove the pot from the heat.
8. Carefully transfer the quince slices and the liquid into clean glass jars, making sure to fill them to the top.
9. Seal the jars tightly and let them cool completely before storing in the refrigerator.
