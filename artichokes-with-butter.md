# Artichokes with Butter

## Description
This recipe is for boiled artichokes served with a butter sauce. The artichokes are cooked until tender and then the chokes are removed. The butter sauce is made with vinegar, salt, nutmeg, and a little flour to thicken it.

## Options and commentary
- You can add some lemon juice to the boiling water for the artichokes to enhance the flavor.
- You can also add some minced garlic to the butter sauce for extra flavor.
- If you prefer a creamier sauce, you can add a splash of cream or milk to the butter sauce.

## Ingredients:
- 4 artichokes
- Salt
- 100g butter
- 2 tablespoons vinegar
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 1/4 teaspoon nutmeg
- 1 tablespoon flour

## Instructions:
1. Fill a large pot with water and add a generous amount of salt. Bring the water to a boil.
2. While the water is heating, prepare the artichokes by trimming the stems and removing any tough outer leaves.
3. Once the water is boiling, carefully add the artichokes to the pot. Cook them for about 30-40 minutes, or until the base of the artichokes can be easily pierced with a fork.
4. While the artichokes are cooking, prepare the butter sauce. In a small saucepan, melt the butter over medium heat.
5. Add the vinegar, salt, and nutmeg to the melted butter. Stir well to combine.
6. Sprinkle the flour over the butter mixture and whisk until smooth. Cook the sauce for a few minutes, stirring constantly, until it thickens slightly.
7. Once the artichokes are cooked, remove them from the pot and let them cool slightly. Cut off the top third of each artichoke and discard.
8. Use a spoon to scoop out the choke (the fuzzy part) from the center of each artichoke.
9. Serve the artichokes warm with the butter sauce drizzled over the top.
