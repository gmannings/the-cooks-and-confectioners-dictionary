# Paste

## Description
This recipe is for making a basic pastry dough called "paste" that can be used for both sweet and savory dishes. The dough is made with flour, cream, eggs, and butter. It can be filled with fruits, meat, or any other desired filling.

## Ingredients:
- 500 grams of flour
- 100 milliliters of cold cream
- 5 eggs
- 450 grams of butter

## Instructions:
1. In a large mixing bowl, combine the flour, cold cream, and eggs. Mix well until a dough forms.
2. Cut the butter into small pieces and add it to the dough. Mix until the butter is evenly distributed throughout the dough.
3. Knead the dough on a lightly floured surface for a few minutes until it becomes smooth and elastic.
4. Divide the dough into two equal portions and shape them into discs. Wrap each disc in plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes to allow the dough to rest and firm up.
