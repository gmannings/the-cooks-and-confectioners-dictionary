# Broiled Salmon

## Description
This recipe calls for slicing or cutting a whole salmon into thick pieces and marinating it in a mixture of claret, wine vinegar, salt, and salad oil. The salmon is then grilled and basted with the marinade. A flavorful sauce is made from the marinade and oyster liquor, which is poured over the grilled salmon. The dish is garnished with herbs and served.

## Options and commentary
- Instead of a whole salmon, you can use salmon fillets or steaks.
- If you don't have claret, you can use red wine.
- Salad oil can be replaced with olive oil or any neutral oil.
- Oyster liquor can be substituted with fish stock or clam juice.
- Feel free to adjust the amount of spices and herbs to your taste.

## Ingredients:
- 1 whole salmon or salmon fillets/steaks
- 1 cup claret or red wine
- 1 cup wine vinegar
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 1/4 cup salad oil or olive oil
- 1 teaspoon ground black pepper
- 1 teaspoon sliced ginger
- 1 clove garlic, minced
- 1 teaspoon ground mace
- 4 whole cloves
- 1 cup oyster liquor or fish stock
- Fresh sprigs of rosemary, thyme, parsley, and sweet marjoram for garnish

## Instructions:
1. If using a whole salmon, slice it into thick pieces or cut it into steaks.
2. In a bowl, combine claret (or red wine), wine vinegar, salt, salad oil (or olive oil), ground black pepper, sliced ginger, minced garlic, ground mace, and whole cloves. Mix well.
3. Place the salmon pieces in a shallow dish and pour the marinade over them. Make sure the salmon is well coated. Let it marinate for at least 30 minutes, turning the pieces occasionally.
4. Preheat the grill to medium-high heat.
5. Remove the salmon from the marinade and reserve the marinade for later use.
6. Place the salmon pieces on the grill and cook for about 4-5 minutes per side, or until the salmon is cooked through and has grill marks. Baste the salmon with the reserved marinade while grilling.
7. While the salmon is grilling, pour the marinade into a saucepan and add oyster liquor (or fish stock). Bring the mixture to a boil and let it simmer for a few minutes to reduce and thicken the sauce.
8. Once the salmon is cooked, transfer it to a serving dish.
9. Pour the sauce over the grilled salmon.
10. Garnish the dish with fresh sprigs of rosemary, thyme, parsley, and sweet marjoram.
11. Serve the broiled salmon immediately.
