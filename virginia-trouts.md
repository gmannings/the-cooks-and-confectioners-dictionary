# Virginia Trouts

## Description
Virginia Trouts is a dish made with pickled herrings that are seasoned with spices and baked. The herrings are then served cold.

## Ingredients:
- 4 pickled herrings
- Water, for soaking
- 4 cloves
- 1/2 teaspoon ground mace
- 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
- 1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
- A pinch of saffron (optional)
- 1 small onion, minced
- 250 ml red wine (Claret)

## Instructions:
1. Cut off the heads of the pickled herrings and place their bodies in a bowl of water. Let them soak for two days and two nights, changing the water once or twice during this time to remove excess saltiness.
2. After soaking, remove the herrings from the water and wash them well to remove any remaining salt.
3. In a small bowl, mix together the cloves, mace, cinnamon, black pepper, and saffron (if using).
4. Season the herrings with the spice mixture, making sure to coat them evenly.
5. Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F).
6. In a baking dish or pot, layer the seasoned herrings with the minced onion, placing a layer of herrings followed by a layer of onion, and repeating until all the herrings and onion are used.
7. Pour the red wine (Claret) over the herrings and onions, making sure they are well covered.
8. Cover the baking dish or pot tightly with a double layer of aluminum foil or parchment paper.
9. Place the dish in the preheated oven and bake for about 45 minutes, or until the herrings are cooked through and tender.
10. Once cooked, remove the dish from the oven and let it cool to room temperature.
11. Serve the Virginia Trouts cold.
