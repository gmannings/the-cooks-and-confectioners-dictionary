# Compots of Quinces

## Description
Compots of Quinces is a sweet and tangy dessert made with quinces, sugar, and citrus juice. The quinces are first scalded to soften them, then peeled and cored. They are then simmered in a mixture of water and sugar until they are thoroughly impregnated with the syrup. Finally, the compots are flavored with the juice of a lemon or orange and served hot.

## Ingredients:
- 4 quinces
- Water
- 200g sugar
- Juice of 1 lemon or orange

## Instructions:
1. Pierce the quinces to the core using a bodkin or a sharp knife.
2. Place the quinces in a large pot and cover them with water. Bring the water to a boil and let the quinces simmer until they become soft. This should take about 30 minutes.
3. Remove the quinces from the pot and let them cool slightly. Once they are cool enough to handle, peel and core them.
4. Fill a pot with half water and half sugar. Place the peeled and cored quinces into the pot.
5. Set the pot on the stove over medium heat and bring the mixture to a simmer. Let the quinces simmer in the syrup for about 20 minutes, or until they are thoroughly impregnated with the syrup.
6. Remove any scum that forms on the surface of the syrup.
7. Squeeze the juice of a lemon or orange into the pot and stir to combine.
8. Serve the compots of quinces hot.
