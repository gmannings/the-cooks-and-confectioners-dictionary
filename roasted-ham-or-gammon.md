# Roasted Ham or Gammon

## Description
This recipe is for roasting a ham or gammon, which is a cured and smoked hind leg of pork. The ham is soaked in luke-warm water to remove excess saltiness, then marinated in Canary wine for several hours before being roasted. The ham is basted with the wine while roasting to enhance the flavor and keep it moist. It is then coated with a mixture of crumbled bread and parsley, and browned in a hot oven. The roasted ham is served in a clean napkin and garnished with green parsley.

## Options and commentary
- You can use either a ham or gammon for this recipe. A ham is typically already cooked and can be served cold or reheated, while a gammon is uncooked and needs to be roasted.
- If you don't have Canary wine, you can use a dry white wine as a substitute.
- The garnish of green parsley adds a fresh and vibrant touch to the dish.

## Ingredients:
- 1 ham or gammon (size of your choice)
- Lukewarm water
- 1 quart (950 ml) Canary wine or dry white wine
- White paper (parchment paper)
- Crumbled bread
- Fresh parsley, finely shredded

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to a high temperature.

2. Remove the skin (swerd) from the ham or gammon.

3. Place the ham or gammon in a large pan and cover it with lukewarm water. Allow it to soak for about 1 hour to remove excess saltiness.

4. Drain the water from the pan and pour the Canary wine (or dry white wine) over the ham or gammon. Let it marinate for 10-12 hours.

5. Preheat the oven to a moderate temperature.

6. Remove the ham or gammon from the marinade and place it on a spit or in a roasting pan.

7. Cover the fat side of the ham or gammon with sheets of white paper.

8. Pour the marinade (Canary wine) into the dripping pan.

9. Place the ham or gammon in the preheated oven and baste it with the marinade every 15-20 minutes while it is roasting.

10. Once the ham or gammon is cooked to your desired level of doneness, remove the paper from the fat side.

11. Sprinkle the ham or gammon with crumbled bread and finely shredded parsley.

12. Increase the oven temperature to high and return the ham or gammon to the oven to brown it.

13. Once the ham or gammon is nicely browned, remove it from the oven and let it cool.
