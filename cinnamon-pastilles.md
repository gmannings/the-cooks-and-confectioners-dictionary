# Cinnamon Pastilles

## Description
Cinnamon pastilles are small, sweet treats made with gum tragacanth, sugar, cinnamon, and egg whites. They have a chewy texture and a warm, spicy flavor.

## Ingredients:
- 1/4 ounce gum tragacanth
- 1 pound sugar
- Water
- 2 egg whites
- Cinnamon powder
- Powdered sugar

## Instructions:
1. In a pan, dissolve 1/4 ounce of gum tragacanth in a little water. Let it stand for two or three days.
2. Stir the gum tragacanth mixture with a spoon and strain it.
3. Transfer the strained mixture into a mortar.
4. Add the whites of two eggs and some finely sifted cinnamon powder to the mortar.
5. Gradually add powdered sugar to the mixture and temper it together until the paste becomes pliable.
6. Shape the paste into desired shapes and designs for the pastilles.
7. Dry the pastilles in a stove or low-temperature oven until they are firm and no longer sticky.

## Cooking time
Approximately 2-3 days for the gum tragacanth mixture to stand. Drying time for the pastilles will vary depending on the temperature and humidity, but it may take several hours to overnight.
