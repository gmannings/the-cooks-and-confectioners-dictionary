# Iced Beverages

## Description
This recipe is for making a variety of iced beverages using a cistern-like box filled with ice and salt to freeze the liquids. The ice and salt mixture creates a cold environment that allows the beverages to congeal and form a slushy texture. The frozen beverages can then be served in china dishes or cups with small pieces of ice.

## Options and commentary
- This recipe allows for the creation of a variety of iced beverages. You can use different flavored liquids such as fruit juices, tea, or coffee to create a range of refreshing drinks.
- You can also experiment with adding fruits, herbs, or spices to the liquids before freezing to enhance the flavors.
- It is important to have a cistern-like container with tin molds to hold the liquids. If you don't have a cistern, you can use a large plastic container or even individual molds.
- Instead of using a hole in the cistern for drainage, you can place the cistern on a tray or in a sink to catch the melted ice and salt mixture.

## Ingredients:
- Liquid of your choice (fruit juice, tea, coffee, etc.)
- Ice cubes or crushed ice
- Salt

## Instructions:
1. Prepare the cistern-like container by cleaning it thoroughly.
2. Place the tin molds inside the cistern, ensuring they fit securely.
3. Fill each tin mold with the desired liquid, leaving some space at the top for expansion during freezing.
4. Cover each tin mold with its respective cover.
5. Fill the empty spaces between the tin molds with ice cubes or crushed ice.
6. Sprinkle salt over the ice, ensuring it covers the entire surface.
7. Repeat steps 5 and 6 until the cistern is filled with ice and salt.
8. Make a hole in the cistern, about halfway up its height, to allow the melted ice and salt to drain.
9. Place the cistern in a tray or sink to catch the melted ice and salt mixture.
10. Leave the cistern undisturbed in a cool place for several hours or overnight, allowing the liquids to freeze.
11. Periodically check the cistern and break the ice that forms on the surface to promote even freezing.
12. Sprinkle more salt around the tin molds to help freeze the remaining liquids.
13. Once the liquids have congealed into a slushy texture, carefully remove the tin molds from the cistern.
14. Serve the iced beverages in china dishes or cups, along with small pieces of ice.

## Cooking time
Several hours or overnight, depending on the size of the cistern and the desired level of freezing.
