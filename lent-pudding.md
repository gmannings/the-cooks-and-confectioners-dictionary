# Lent Pudding

## Description
Lent Pudding is a creamy and rich dessert made with eggs and cream. It has a smooth texture and a delicate flavor. This recipe is a modernized version of an 18th-century Lent Pudding.

## Options and commentary
- You can add a pinch of nutmeg or cinnamon for additional flavor.
- Serve the pudding warm or chilled, depending on your preference.

## Ingredients:
- 1 liter of cream
- 2-3 blades of mace
- 8 egg yolks
- 4 egg whites

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F).
2. In a saucepan, heat the cream and mace blades over medium heat until it starts to simmer. Remove from heat.
3. In a mixing bowl, whisk together the egg yolks and egg whites until well combined.
4. Slowly pour the hot cream into the egg mixture, whisking continuously to prevent curdling.
5. Strain the mixture through a fine-mesh sieve to remove any lumps or mace blades.
6. Pour the strained mixture into a greased baking dish or individual ramekins.
7. Place the baking dish or ramekins in a larger baking pan and fill the pan with enough hot water to reach halfway up the sides of the dish or ramekins. This creates a water bath.
8. Carefully transfer the pan to the preheated oven and bake for about 40-45 minutes, or until the pudding is set and lightly golden on top.
9. Remove the pudding from the oven and let it cool for a few minutes.
10. Serve the Lent Pudding warm or chilled, as desired.
