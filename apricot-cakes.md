# Apricot Cakes

## Description
Apricot Cakes are a sweet treat made with ripe apricots and sugar. The apricots are scalded, peeled, and mashed before being combined with a sugar syrup. The mixture is then boiled and poured into shallow glasses to set. After a few days, the cakes are removed from the glasses and dried on glass plates.

## Ingredients:
- 900 grams ripe apricots
- 450 grams double refined sugar
- 2 tablespoons water

## Instructions:
1. Bring a pot of water to a boil.
2. Place the ripe apricots in the boiling water for about 1 minute to scald them.
3. Remove the apricots from the boiling water and immediately transfer them to a bowl of ice water to cool.
4. Once cooled, peel the apricots and remove the stones.
5. Mash the apricots into a pulp.
6. In a separate pot, combine the double refined sugar and water.
7. Heat the sugar and water mixture over medium heat, stirring constantly, until it reaches the candy stage (approximately 300°F or 150°C).
8. Add the apricot pulp to the sugar syrup and continue to cook for 15 minutes, stirring well.
9. Remove the mixture from the heat and pour it into shallow, flat glasses.
10. Allow the mixture to set in the glasses for two days.
11. After two days, carefully remove the cakes from the glasses and place them on glass plates.
12. Turn the cakes every day to ensure even drying.
13. Let the cakes dry for several days until they are firm and no longer sticky.
