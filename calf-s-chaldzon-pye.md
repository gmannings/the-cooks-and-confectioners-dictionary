# Calf's Chaldzon Pye

## Description
Calf's Chaldzon Pye is a traditional meat pie made with minced calf's chaldron (a type of offal), seasoned with spices, verjuice (a sour juice), currants, bread crumbs, and sugar. The mixture is then filled into a pastry crust and baked until golden and cooked through.

## Ingredients:
- 500g minced calf's chaldron
- 50g marrow (or substitute with butter)
- 1/2 teaspoon pepper
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 1/4 teaspoon nutmeg
- 1/4 teaspoon cloves
- 1/4 teaspoon mace
- 2 tablespoons verjuice (or substitute with lemon juice)
- 2 tablespoons currants
- 2 tablespoons grated bread crumbs
- 1 tablespoon sugar
- 1 teaspoon lemon peel, finely shredded
- Pastry crust for a pie

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F).

2. In a large bowl, combine the minced calf's chaldron, marrow (or butter), pepper, salt, nutmeg, cloves, and mace. Mix well to evenly distribute the seasonings.

3. Add the verjuice (or lemon juice), currants, grated bread crumbs, sugar, and shredded lemon peel to the bowl. Mix everything together until well combined.

4. Roll out the pastry crust and line a pie dish with it.

5. Pour the calf's chaldron mixture into the pastry-lined pie dish, spreading it out evenly.

6. Cover the pie with another layer of pastry, sealing the edges by crimping or pressing with a fork. Cut a few slits in the top crust to allow steam to escape.

7. Place the pie in the preheated oven and bake for approximately 45-50 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown and the filling is cooked through.

8. Remove the pie from the oven and let it cool for a few minutes before serving.
