# Preserved Angelica Roots

## Description
Preserved Angelica Roots are a sweet and tangy treat made from the roots of the Angelica plant. The roots are sliced thin, steeped in water, and then cooked in a sugar syrup. This process helps to preserve the roots and enhances their flavor.

## Ingredients:

## Instructions:
1. Wash the Angelica roots thoroughly to remove any dirt or debris.
2. Slice the roots into thin pieces.

10. Once the syrup is boiling, add the cooked Angelica roots to the pot.
11. Boil the roots in the syrup until they are cooked enough to your liking.
