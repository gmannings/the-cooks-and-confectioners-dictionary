# Fine Toalls

## Description
Fine Toalls are a delicious and indulgent breakfast or dessert dish from the 18th century. They consist of round slices of bread soaked in a creamy mixture of cream, eggs, sugar, and nutmeg, then fried in butter until golden and crispy. They are served with a generous drizzle of butter, sugar, and a hint of rose water for a delightful flavor.

## Ingredients:
- 1 penny loaf (or any round loaf of bread)
- 200 ml cream
- 2 eggs
- 2 tablespoons sugar
- 1/2 teaspoon grated nutmeg
- Butter, for frying
- Additional butter, for serving
- Additional sugar, for serving
- A few drops of rose water, for serving

## Instructions:
1. Cut the penny loaf (or round loaf of bread) into round slices, about 1 cm thick.
2. In a shallow dish, pour the cream and beat in the eggs, sugar, and grated nutmeg until well combined.
3. Heat a frying pan over medium heat and add a knob of butter.
4. Dip one side of each bread slice into the cream mixture, ensuring it is well coated.
5. Place the bread slices, wet side down, in the frying pan. You may need to do this in batches depending on the size of your pan.
6. Pour the remaining cream mixture over the bread slices in the pan.
7. Fry the bread slices for about 2-3 minutes on each side, or until they are golden brown and crispy.
8. Remove the fried toasts from the pan and place them on a serving plate.
9. Serve the fine toalls with a generous drizzle of melted butter, a sprinkle of sugar, and a few drops of rose water.
