# Almond Macaroons

## Description
Almond macaroons are sweet, chewy cookies made with ground almonds, sugar, and rose water. They are typically topped with a sugary glaze and baked until golden brown.

## Options and commentary
- You can add a pinch of ground cinnamon or cardamom for extra flavor.
- If you don't have rose water, you can use almond extract instead.
- The cookies can be enjoyed as is, or you can sandwich two cookies together with a filling of your choice, such as chocolate ganache or raspberry jam.

## Ingredients:
- 250g blanched almonds
- 250g fine sugar
- 1 tsp rose water
- 25g all-purpose flour
- A pinch of ground cinnamon or cardamom (optional)
- Musk (a tiny amount, as it is a strong flavor)
- Butter or cooking spray, for greasing
- Extra sugar, for dusting

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F) and line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
2. In a food processor, grind the blanched almonds until they resemble a fine meal.
3. In a large bowl, combine the ground almonds, sugar, rose water, flour, and ground cinnamon or cardamom (if using). Mix well.
4. Add a tiny amount of musk to the mixture and stir until evenly distributed. Be careful not to add too much, as musk has a strong flavor.
5. Grease your hands with butter or cooking spray to prevent the mixture from sticking. Take small portions of the dough and shape them into small, oval-shaped cookies.
6. Place the cookies on the prepared baking sheet, leaving some space between each cookie.
7. Dust the tops of the cookies with a little extra sugar.
8. Bake in the preheated oven for about 12-15 minutes, or until the cookies are golden brown around the edges.
9. Remove from the oven and let the cookies cool completely on a wire rack before serving.
