# Cock-Ale

## Description
Cock-Ale is a traditional English beer infused with the flavors of young cocks, raisins, dates, mace, nutmegs, and Canary wine. It is a rich and flavorful ale that was believed to have medicinal properties, particularly for consumption and restoring vitality.

## Options and commentary
- If you cannot find young cocks, you can substitute with chicken or game hen.
- If you prefer a milder flavor, you can reduce the amount of spices used.
- The ale can be consumed after one day of fermentation, but it is recommended to wait for at least three days for the flavors to develop fully.

## Ingredients:
- 2 young cocks (or chicken/game hen)
- 4 gallons of ale
- 4 pounds of raisins
- 1 pound of dates
- 2 ounces of mace
- 2 ounces of nutmegs
- 1 quart of Canary wine
- 1/2 pint of new ale yeast

## Instructions:
1. In a large pot, bring water to a boil and add the young cocks. Boil them until they are almost jelly-like in texture. This may take a few hours.
2. Remove the cooked cocks from the pot and set them aside to cool.
3. Once the cocks have cooled, remove the meat from the bones and discard the bones. Shred the meat into small pieces.
4. In a separate pot, heat the ale over medium heat until it is warm but not boiling.
5. Add the shredded cock meat, raisins, dates, mace, and nutmegs to the warm ale. Stir well to combine.
6. In a small bowl, pour the Canary wine and add the mace and nutmegs. Allow them to infuse for a few minutes.
7. Pour the infused Canary wine into the pot with the ale and other ingredients. Stir well.
8. Cover the pot and let the mixture sit for 24 hours to allow the flavors to meld.
9. After 24 hours, strain the liquid through a fine-mesh sieve to remove any solids. Press down on the solids to extract as much liquid as possible.
10. Transfer the strained liquid to a clean container and add the new ale yeast. Stir gently to incorporate the yeast.
11. Cover the container and let the mixture ferment for at least 3 days. The longer it ferments, the stronger the flavors will be.
12. Once the fermentation is complete, the Cock-Ale is ready to be enjoyed. Serve it chilled or at room temperature.

## Cooking time
- Boiling the cocks: several hours
- Fermentation: at least 3 days
