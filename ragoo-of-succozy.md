# Ragoo of Succozy

## Description
Ragoo of Succozy is a savory dish made with succory (also known as chicory), which is blanched and then cooked in a flavorful sauce. The succory is simmered with lard, flour, gravy, and a combination of spices and herbs, resulting in a dish with a slightly bitter and tangy flavor.

## Ingredients:
- 1 head of succory (chicory)
- 2 tablespoons lard
- 2 tablespoons flour
- 1 cup beef or vegetable broth
- Salt and pepper to taste
- 1 teaspoon mixed spices (such as paprika, cumin, and coriander)
- 1 faggot of fresh herbs (such as thyme, parsley, and bay leaf)
- 1 tablespoon vinegar

## Instructions:
1. Bring a pot of water to a boil and blanch the succory for 2 minutes. Drain and set aside.
2. In a stewpan, melt the lard over medium heat.
3. Add the flour to the melted lard and cook until it turns slightly brown, stirring constantly.
4. Gradually add the broth to the stewpan, stirring continuously to avoid lumps.
5. Season the sauce with salt, pepper, and the mixed spices.
6. Tie the fresh herbs together with kitchen twine to create a faggot.
7. Add the faggot of herbs and vinegar to the sauce.
8. Cut the blanched succory into bite-sized pieces and add them to the sauce.
9. Bring the sauce to a boil, then reduce the heat and simmer for 10-15 minutes, until the succory is tender but not overcooked.
10. Taste and adjust the seasoning if needed.
11. Remove the faggot of herbs from the sauce.
12. Serve the Ragoo of Succozy hot as a side dish or as a topping for grilled meats.
