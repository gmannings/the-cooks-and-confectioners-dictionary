# Carp Pie

## Description
This recipe is for a traditional 18th-century dish called Carp Pie. It involves gutting, scaling, and scalding the carp, then larding it with eel lardons. The carp is seasoned with salt, pepper, nutmeg, cloves, butter, and a bay leaf. The pie crust is made long-ways to fit the length of the carp. Optionally, the carp's belly can be stuffed with a filling made of mushrooms, artichoke bottoms, oysters, carp, milt, truffles, morils, and tails of crayfish. The pie is baked in a moderate oven, and halfway through baking, a glass of white wine is poured in. Once fully baked, the pie is cut open, the fat is removed, and a ragout of oysters is poured in. This dish can be served as a first course.

## Options and commentary
- Instead of larding the carp with eel lardons, you can use bacon or pancetta.
- The filling for the carp's belly is optional and can be adjusted to personal preference.
- The ragout of oysters can be substituted with a different seafood or omitted altogether.
