# Green Peas Pottage

## Description
Green Peas Pottage is a hearty and comforting dish made with fresh peas. The peas are boiled until tender, then strained and thickened to create a creamy texture. The dish is seasoned with salt, butter, and herbs for added flavor. It is traditionally served in a deep dish with salt and sippets (small pieces of toasted bread) placed around it.

## Ingredients:
- 500g fresh peas
- Water
- Salt
- 2 tablespoons butter
- A bunch of fresh herbs (such as parsley, thyme, or mint)
- Sippets (small pieces of toasted bread)

## Instructions:
1. Shell and clean the peas, removing any dirt or debris.
2. In a saucepan, bring a large pot of water to a boil.
3. Add the peas to the boiling water and cook until tender, about 10 minutes.
4. Remove a portion of the cooked peas from the saucepan and strain them through a sieve or use a blender to puree them.
5. Return the pureed peas to the saucepan with the remaining peas.
6. Stir in salt and butter to taste.
7. If using a bunch of fresh herbs, tie them together with kitchen twine and add them to the saucepan. If using chopped herbs, add them directly to the saucepan.
8. Continue cooking the peas for a few more minutes until the flavors are well combined and the mixture has thickened slightly.
9. Remove the bunch of herbs, if used.
10. Dish the peas into a deep dish.
11. Place salt and sippets around the peas as a garnish.
12. Serve hot.
