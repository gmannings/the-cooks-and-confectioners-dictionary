# Stewed Chicken in White Wine Sauce

## Description
This recipe is for stewed chicken in a flavorful white wine sauce. The chicken is cooked until tender and then simmered in a mixture of white wine, water, butter, herbs, and spices. The sauce is thickened with breadcrumbs and seasoned with salt, pepper, and nutmeg. The dish is finished with a garnish of parsley, sliced lemon, and marrow.

## Ingredients:
- 2 chicken quarters
- 1 cup white wine
- 1/2 cup water
- 1/4 cup butter
- 1 bunch of fresh sweet herbs (such as thyme, rosemary, and sage)
- 1 large mace blade
- 1 slice of bread, grated into breadcrumbs
- Salt and pepper to taste
- 1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg
- 2 egg yolks
- Juice of 1 lemon
- Marrow (optional)
- Fresh parsley, for garnish
- Sliced lemon, for garnish

## Instructions:
1. Quarter the chicken.
2. In a large pot, combine the white wine and water. The ratio of wine to water should be higher for a more flavorful sauce.
3. Add the chicken quarters to the pot and bring the liquid to a simmer.
4. Cook the chicken over low heat until it is tender and cooked through. This will take approximately 30-40 minutes.
5. Meanwhile, prepare the sauce. In a separate saucepan, melt the butter over medium heat.
6. Add the sweet herbs and mace blade to the melted butter and cook for a few minutes to infuse the flavors.
7. Gradually sprinkle in the grated bread, stirring constantly to prevent lumps from forming.
8. Continue cooking the sauce until it thickens to your desired consistency.
9. Season the sauce with salt, pepper, and ground nutmeg to taste.
10. If desired, add chopped parsley and sage to the sauce for additional flavor.
11. In a small bowl, whisk together the egg yolks and lemon juice until well combined.
12. Remove the pot of chicken from the heat and slowly pour the egg yolk mixture into the sauce, stirring constantly to prevent curdling.
13. Return the pot to low heat and cook for a few more minutes to thicken the sauce further.
14. Optional: Place marrow on top of the chicken for added richness.
15. Garnish the dish with fresh parsley and sliced lemon.
16. Serve the stewed chicken in white wine sauce hot.

## Cooking time
Approximately 30-40 minutes for cooking the chicken, plus additional time for preparing the sauce.
