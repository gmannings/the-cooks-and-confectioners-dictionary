# Spirit of Clary

## Description
Spirit of Clary is a fragrant and aromatic spirit made from a combination of various flowers and herbs steeped in Sack (a type of fortified wine) and then distilled. It has a sweet and floral flavor profile.

## Ingredients:
- 2 liters of Sack (fortified wine)
- 2 pounds of Clary flowers
- 2 pounds of Clove-July flowers
- 2 pounds of Archangel flowers
- 2 pounds of Lilly of the Valley flowers
- 2 pounds of Comfrey flowers
- Sifted sugar-candy
- Ambergreefe (optional)

## Instructions:
1. In a large container, combine the Clary flowers, Clove-July flowers, Archangel flowers, Lilly of the Valley flowers, and Comfrey flowers.
2. Pour the 2 liters of Sack over the flowers and stir gently to combine.
3. Cover the container and let the mixture steep overnight.
4. The next day, set up a glass still and ensure it is well sealed to prevent any spirits from escaping.
5. Transfer the steeped flower and Sack mixture into the glass still.
6. Place the glass still over a very gentle fire and start the distillation process.
7. Allow the distillation to continue until the desired amount of spirit has been collected. This may take several hours.
8. While the spirit is being collected, prepare a bottle by adding sifted sugar-candy to it. The amount of sugar-candy can vary depending on personal preference for sweetness.
9. If desired, place a bag of Ambergreefe in the bottle to add a subtle fragrance to the spirit as it drips in.
10. Once the distillation is complete, carefully pour the spirit into the prepared bottle, ensuring that it passes through the bag of Ambergreefe if using.
11. Seal the bottle tightly and let the Spirit of Clary age for a few weeks to allow the flavors to meld and develop.

## Cooking time
Several hours for distillation, plus additional time for aging.
