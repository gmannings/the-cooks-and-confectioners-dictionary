# Sewn Barbels

## Description
Sewn Barbels is a dish made with barbels, a type of fish. The fish is scalded and then stewed with wine, butter, herbs, and seasonings. There are two options for serving: one with a thickened sauce made with butter and flour, and the other with a ragout made with mushrooms, truffles, artichoke bottoms, and fish broth or onion juice.

## Options and commentary
- Option 1: Thickened Sauce - This option includes a thickened sauce made with butter and flour.
- Option 2: Ragout - This option includes a ragout made with mushrooms, truffles, artichoke bottoms, and fish broth or onion juice.

## Ingredients:
- 2 barbels
- 1 cup white wine
- 2 tablespoons fresh butter
- Pepper to taste
- Salt to taste
- 1 bunch of fresh herbs (such as parsley, thyme, and bay leaves)
- 1 tablespoon flour (for Option 1)
- 1 cup mushrooms, sliced (for Option 2)
- 2 truffles, sliced (for Option 2)
- 4 artichoke bottoms, sliced (for Option 2)
- 1 cup fish broth or onion juice (for Option 2)

## Instructions:
1. Scald the barbels by placing them in a pot of boiling water for a few seconds. This will help remove the scales and make them easier to handle. Remove the barbels from the water and carefully peel off the scales.
2. Draw the barbels by making a shallow incision along the belly and removing the innards. Rinse the barbels under cold water to clean them thoroughly.
3. In a stew-pan, combine the white wine, fresh butter, pepper, salt, and the bunch of fresh herbs. Place the stew-pan over medium heat and bring the mixture to a simmer.
4. Add the barbels to the simmering liquid in the stew-pan. Cover the stew-pan and let the barbels cook for about 15-20 minutes, or until they are cooked through and tender.
5. For Option 1 (Thickened Sauce): In a small bowl, knead a bit of butter with a little flour to form a paste. When the barbels are ready, remove them from the stew-pan and set aside. Stir the butter-flour paste into the simmering liquid in the stew-pan to thicken the sauce. Cook for an additional 2-3 minutes, stirring constantly, until the sauce has thickened.
6. For Option 2 (Ragout): In a separate saucepan, melt some fresh butter over medium heat. Add the sliced mushrooms, truffles, and artichoke bottoms to the saucepan. Cook for about 5 minutes, or until the mushrooms are tender. Add the fish broth or onion juice to the saucepan and bring to a simmer. Cook for an additional 5 minutes to allow the flavors to meld together.
7. To serve, place the cooked barbels on a serving platter. For Option 1, pour the thickened sauce over the barbels. For Option 2, spoon the ragout over the barbels.
8. Serve the Sewn Barbels hot and enjoy!

## Cooking time
- Option 1 (Thickened Sauce): Approximately 25-30 minutes
- Option 2 (Ragout): Approximately 30-35 minutes
