## Instructions:
1. Clean the morel mushrooms by removing the stalks and soaking them in water to remove any grit.

8. Cover the mushrooms with another layer of seasoned veal slices.
9. Place bacon slices on top of the veal slices to cover the dish.

   - For stewing: Place the tart pan on the stovetop and cook with heat from both the top and bottom until the dish is cooked through.
   - For baking: Preheat the oven to the appropriate temperature and bake the dish until cooked through.
11. Once cooked, remove the dish from the heat or oven and allow the mushrooms to drain individually.
12. Pour some ham essence into a serving dish and place the cooked morels on top.
