# Dueling Pigeons with Sweet Basil

## Description
This recipe is for a dish called "Dueling Pigeons with Sweet Basil" from an 18th-century cookbook. It involves scalding pigeons, stuffing them with a mixture of raw bacon, sweet basil, and chibbol (a type of onion), and then cooking them in broth. The pigeons are then coated in beaten eggs and breadcrumbs, fried until brown, and garnished with parsley. This dish can be served as a side dish.

## Options and commentary
- Instead of pigeons, you can use chicken or Cornish game hens as a modern alternative.
- If you don't have verjuice (a sour juice made from unripe grapes), you can use lemon juice or white wine vinegar as a substitute.
- Chibbol can be replaced with shallots or spring onions.
- You can adjust the seasoning according to your taste preferences.

## Ingredients:
- 2 pigeons (or chicken/Cornish game hens)
- 100g raw bacon, minced
- 2 tablespoons sweet basil, finely chopped
- 2 chibbol (or shallots/spring onions), finely chopped
- 500ml good broth (chicken or vegetable)
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 2 tablespoons verjuice (or lemon juice/white wine vinegar)
- 1 onion
- 4 cloves
- 2 eggs, beaten
- 100g grated bread (breadcrumbs)
- Lard or vegetable oil, for frying
- Fresh parsley, for garnish

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 180Â°C.
2. Scald the pigeons by placing them in a pot of boiling water for a few seconds. This will help remove any feathers and make the skin easier to work with.
3. Make a small farce (stuffing) by combining the minced raw bacon, sweet basil, and chopped chibbol in a bowl. Season the mixture with salt.
4. Make a small slit on the back of each pigeon and stuff them with the farce mixture.
5. Place the stuffed pigeons in a stew-pan and add the good broth, salt, verjuice, and the onion studded with cloves.
6. Bring the broth to a simmer and cook the pigeons for about 30 minutes, or until they are cooked through. Remove the pigeons from the broth and set them aside.
7. In a shallow dish, place the beaten eggs. In another shallow dish, place the grated bread.
8. Dip each pigeon into the beaten eggs, making sure it is well coated. Then, roll the pigeon in the grated bread, pressing gently to ensure the breadcrumbs adhere to the surface.
9. Heat lard or vegetable oil in a frying pan over medium heat. Fry the pigeons until they are golden brown on all sides. This may take about 5 minutes per side.
10. Once the pigeons are fried, remove them from the pan and place them on a paper towel-lined plate to drain any excess oil.
11. In the same pan, fry some parsley until it becomes crispy. This will be used as a garnish for the pigeons.
12. To serve, place the fried pigeons on a serving platter and garnish with the fried parsley.
13. Serve the dueling pigeons with sweet basil as a side dish.
