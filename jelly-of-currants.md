# Jelly of Currants

## Description
Jelly of Currants is a sweet and tangy fruit jelly made from ripe currants. It is a versatile condiment that can be used in various desserts, spreads, or as a topping for toast or scones.

## Ingredients:
- Ripe currants
- Sugar

## Instructions:
1. Wash the currants thoroughly and remove any stems or leaves.
2. Place the currants in a large pot and crush them using a potato masher or the back of a spoon to release the juice.
3. Line a colander or sieve with a coarse linen cloth and place it over a large bowl or pot.
4. Pour the crushed currants into the lined colander or sieve and let the juice strain through the cloth. Use the back of a spoon to press down on the currants to extract as much juice as possible.
5. Discard the leftover pulp and seeds.
6. Transfer the collected juice to a clean pot and heat it over medium heat.
7. Add half a pound of sugar for each pint of juice to the pot.
8. Stir the mixture continuously until the sugar has dissolved completely.
9. Increase the heat to high and bring the mixture to a boil.
10. Continue boiling the mixture until it reaches the candy stage, which is when a small amount dropped into cold water forms a firm ball or reaches a temperature of 250°F (121°C) on a candy thermometer.
11. Once the jelly has reached the candy stage, reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer the mixture until about one-third of the liquid has evaporated. This will help thicken the jelly.
12. Remove the pot from the heat and let the jelly cool slightly.
13. Pour the jelly into sterilized jars and seal them tightly.
14. Allow the jelly to cool completely before storing it in the refrigerator.
