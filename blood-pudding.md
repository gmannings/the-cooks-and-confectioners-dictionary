# Blood Pudding

## Description
Blood pudding is a traditional dish made from the blood of an animal, typically an ox or pig. In this recipe, the warm blood is mixed with salt, strained, and then soaked with groats of oatmeal overnight. The mixture is seasoned with pepper, cloves, mace, nutmeg, and fennel seeds, as well as herbs like rosemary, thyme, savory, and pennyroyal.
