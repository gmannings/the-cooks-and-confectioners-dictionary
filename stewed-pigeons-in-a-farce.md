# Stewed Pigeons in a Farce

## Description
This recipe is for stewed pigeons that are wrapped in a flavorful farce made from minced and pounded poultry meat. The pigeons are then dipped in beaten eggs, coated with a mixture of breadcrumbs and flour, and fried until brown. They are served on a dish with fried parsley.

## Ingredients:
- 4 quail pigeons
- 500g mixed poultry meat (such as chicken and turkey)
- 2 eggs
- 100g breadcrumbs
- 50g flour
- Oil for frying
- Salt and pepper to taste
- Fresh parsley for garnish

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 180Â°C.
2. In a large pot, stew the quail pigeons until they are cooked through. This can be done either on a stovetop or in the oven between two fires.
3. While the pigeons are stewing, prepare the farce. Mince the mixed poultry meat finely and pound it in a mortar until it forms a paste.
4. Once the pigeons are cooked, remove them from the pot and let them cool slightly.
5. Take a portion of the farce and wrap each pigeon in it, ensuring that only the heads are visible.
6. In a shallow dish, beat the eggs.
7. Dip each wrapped pigeon in the beaten eggs, making sure it is fully coated.
8. In another dish, mix the breadcrumbs and flour together.
9. Roll each egg-coated pigeon in the breadcrumb and flour mixture, ensuring it is evenly coated.
10. Heat oil in a frying pan over medium heat.
11. Fry the coated pigeons in the hot oil until they are browned on all sides.
12. Remove the fried pigeons from the pan and place them on a napkin-lined dish.
13. Garnish with fried parsley between the pigeons.
14. Serve the stewed pigeons in a farce immediately.
