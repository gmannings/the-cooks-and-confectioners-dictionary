# Fith-broth

## Description
Fith-broth is a traditional 18th-century fish broth made with a combination of tenches, carps, pikes, and eels. The fish is prepared, cut into pieces, and boiled with water, salt, butter, an onion studded with cloves, and a bunch of sweet herbs. The broth is then strained and divided into three smaller kettles. One of the kettles is used to make a flavorful sauce with mushroom trimmings, lemon slices, and fried wheat flour.

## Options and commentary
- You can use any combination of fish that you prefer or have available. Popular options include salmon, trout, and whitefish.
- If you don't have access to fresh fish, you can use frozen fish fillets instead.
- The mushroom trimmings can be substituted with dried mushrooms or mushroom stock for a richer flavor.
- You can adjust the amount of lemon slices based on your preference for acidity.
- The fried wheat flour can be replaced with a roux made from butter and flour for a thicker sauce.
