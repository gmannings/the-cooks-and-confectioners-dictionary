# Fried Cutlets with Verjuice

## Description
This recipe is for fried cutlets that are dipped in a batter made of flour and eggs, then fried in lard. The cutlets are served with a seasoning of salt, pepper, and verjuice. Verjuice is a tart, acidic juice made from unripe grapes or other sour fruits.

## Ingredients:
- 4 pork cutlets
- 1 cup flour
- 2 eggs
- Lard or vegetable oil for frying
- Salt and pepper to taste
- Verjuice (can be substituted with lemon juice or vinegar)

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 200°C (400°F).
2. Fill a large pot with water and bring it to a boil.
3. Add the pork cutlets to the boiling water and cook them for about 5 minutes, or until they are cooked through.
4. While the cutlets are boiling, prepare the batter by whisking together the flour and eggs in a shallow bowl until well combined.
5. Heat a large frying pan over medium heat and add enough lard or vegetable oil to cover the bottom of the pan.
6. Remove the cooked cutlets from the boiling water and pat them dry with paper towels.
7. Dip each cutlet into the batter, making sure it is evenly coated.
8. Place the battered cutlets into the hot frying pan and cook them for about 2-3 minutes on each side, or until they are golden brown and crispy.
9. Once the cutlets are cooked, transfer them to a paper towel-lined plate to drain any excess oil.
10. Season the fried cutlets with salt and pepper to taste.
11. Serve the cutlets with a drizzle of verjuice, lemon juice, or vinegar on top.
