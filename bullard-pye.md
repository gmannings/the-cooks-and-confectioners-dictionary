# Bullard Pye

## Description
Bullard Pye is a traditional 18th-century dish consisting of a seasoned and larded meat filling encased in a pastry crust. The pie is baked until golden and then filled with clarified butter. It is a rich and flavorful dish that can be served as a main course or as a centerpiece for a special occasion.

## Ingredients:
- 1 pork loin (approximately 500g)
- Salt
- Pepper
- Nutmeg
- 100g butter, plus extra for greasing
- 1 teaspoon ground cloves
- Pastry dough (store-bought or homemade)
- Clarified butter (for filling)

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F).
2. Bone the pork loin and remove any excess fat.
3. Parboil the pork loin by placing it in a pot of boiling water for 5 minutes. This will help to partially cook the meat and remove any impurities.
4. Remove the pork loin from the pot and pat it dry with paper towels.
5. Lard the pork loin by inserting thin strips of fat into the meat. This will help to keep the meat moist and add flavor.
6. Season the pork loin with salt, pepper, and nutmeg. Be generous with the seasoning to ensure a flavorful filling.
7. Grease the bottom of a pie dish with butter.
8. Sprinkle the ground cloves evenly over the butter.
9. Place the seasoned and larded pork loin in the pie dish.
10. Sprinkle additional seasoning over the pork loin.
11. Cut the 100g of butter into small pieces and scatter them over the pork loin.
12. Roll out the pastry dough and use it to cover the pie dish, sealing the edges.
13. Bake the pie in the preheated oven for approximately 1 hour, or until the pastry is golden brown and the pork loin is cooked through.
14. Once the pie is cooked, remove it from the oven and allow it to cool completely.
15. Once the pie is cold, carefully pour clarified butter into the pie dish, filling it up to the top. This will help to preserve the pie and add richness to the flavor.
16. Place the pie in the refrigerator to allow the clarified butter to solidify.
17. Serve the Bullard Pye cold, slicing it into portions and enjoying the rich and flavorful filling.
