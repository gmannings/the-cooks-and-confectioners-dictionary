# Roasted Beet's Foot

## Description
This recipe is for roasting a beet's foot, which has been boiled and blanched. The foot is then larded and secured on a small spit. It is basted with a mixture of butter, vinegar, and nutmeg. The sauce is made by toasting bread, soaking it in claret and vinegar, straining it, and adding cloves, ginger, and cinnamon. The sauce is thickened on the fire with a branch of rosemary. The roasted foot is then served with the sauce poured over it.
