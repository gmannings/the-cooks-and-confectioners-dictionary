# Roast Leg of Mutton with Savory Herb Ragout

## Description
This recipe is a modernized version of an 18th-century dish. A tender leg of mutton is roasted to perfection and served with a flavorful savory herb ragout. The ragout adds a burst of freshness and complements the rich flavors of the roasted meat.

## Options and commentary
- You can use lamb leg instead of mutton if you prefer a milder flavor.
- Feel free to adjust the herbs and seasonings in the ragout according to your taste preferences.
- Serve the roasted leg of mutton with roasted vegetables or mashed potatoes for a complete meal.

## Ingredients:
- 1 leg of mutton (approximately 2 kg)
- Salt and pepper, to taste
- 2 tablespoons olive oil

For the savory herb ragout:
- 1 tablespoon butter
- 1 onion, finely chopped
- 2 cloves of garlic, minced
- 1 cup chicken or vegetable broth
- 1 tablespoon flour
- 1 tablespoon white wine vinegar
- 1 bundle of fresh savory herbs (such as thyme, rosemary, and sage)
- Salt and pepper, to taste

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F).
2. Season the leg of mutton generously with salt and pepper on all sides.
3. Heat the olive oil in a large oven-safe skillet or roasting pan over medium-high heat.
4. Sear the leg of mutton on all sides until browned, about 3-4 minutes per side.
5. Transfer the skillet or roasting pan to the preheated oven and roast the leg of mutton for about 1.5 to 2 hours, or until the internal temperature reaches 60°C (140°F) for medium-rare or 65°C (150°F) for medium. 
6. While the leg of mutton is roasting, prepare the savory herb ragout.
7. In a separate saucepan, melt the butter over medium heat.
8. Add the chopped onion and minced garlic to the saucepan and sauté until softened and lightly browned.
9. Sprinkle the flour over the onions and garlic, stirring constantly for about 1 minute to cook off the raw flour taste.
10. Slowly pour in the chicken or vegetable broth, stirring continuously to avoid lumps.
11. Add the white wine vinegar and the bundle of fresh savory herbs to the saucepan.
12. Simmer the ragout over low heat for about 15-20 minutes, or until the flavors have melded together and the sauce has thickened slightly.
13. Season the ragout with salt and pepper to taste.
14. Once the leg of mutton is cooked to your desired doneness, remove it from the oven and let it rest for about 10-15 minutes before carving.
15. Serve the roasted leg of mutton with the savory herb ragout on the side.
