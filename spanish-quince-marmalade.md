# Spanish Quince Marmalade

## Description
This recipe is for making Spanish-style quince marmalade. It involves cooking ripe quinces with sugar and flavorings until they become a thick, sweet spread. The marmalade is then cooled and stored in pots or boxes.

## Ingredients:
- 4.5 kg ripe quinces
- 710 ml water
- 900 g fine sugar
- Rosewater
- Sack or white wine
- Orange-water
- Perfumed comfits (for garnish)

## Instructions:
1. Peel and core the quinces, then cut them into small pieces.
2. In a large pot, combine the quinces, water, and sugar.
3. Place the pot over low heat and let it simmer gently, stirring occasionally, until the quinces start to become dry.
4. Add a splash of rosewater and a splash of sack or white wine to the pot.
5. Continue cooking the mixture over low heat until it thickens and the quinces are completely soft.
6. Once the mixture is thick and the quinces are soft, remove the pot from the heat.
7. Use a potato masher or a blender to mash the quinces into a smooth pulp.
8. Return the pot to low heat and add an additional 900 g of sugar, along with a little orange-water and rosewater.
9. Stir the mixture constantly until the sugar has dissolved and the marmalade has thickened to your desired consistency.
10. To test if the marmalade is done, drop a small amount onto a plate. If it comes off clean, it is ready.
11. Remove the pot from the heat and let the marmalade cool slightly.
12. Transfer the marmalade into clean pots or boxes, making sure to leave some space at the top for expansion.
13. Sprinkle some perfumed comfits over the top of the marmalade for added decoration.
14. Cover the pots or boxes tightly and store in a cool, dark place.
