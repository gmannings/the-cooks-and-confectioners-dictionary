# Drying Apples

## Description
This recipe describes how to dry apples by preserving them with their stalks on and then drying them in a gentle oven or over a stove. Dried apples can be used in various recipes or enjoyed as a healthy snack.

## Ingredients:
- Apples

## Instructions:
1. Wash the apples thoroughly to remove any dirt or debris. If desired, you can also wipe them with a clean cloth.
2. Leave the stalks on the apples as they will help to preserve their shape during the drying process.
3. Place the apples on tin plates or baking sheets, ensuring that they are not touching each other.
4. If using a stove, set it to a low heat. If using an oven, preheat it to a low temperature (around 50-60°C or 120-140°F).
5. Place the tin plates or baking sheets with the apples on top of the stove or in the oven.
6. Allow the apples to dry slowly, turning them occasionally to ensure even drying. This process may take several hours or even a day, depending on the size and moisture content of the apples.
7. Check the apples regularly to ensure they are drying evenly and not becoming too dry or burnt.
8. Once the apples are completely dry and have a leathery texture, remove them from the stove or oven.
9. Let the dried apples cool completely before storing them in an airtight container or resealable bags.

## Cooking time
Several hours to a day, depending on the size and moisture content of the apples.
