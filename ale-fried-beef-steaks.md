# Ale-Fried Beef Steaks

## Description
Ale-Fried Beef Steaks are tender beef steaks that are seasoned with a flavorful mixture of spices and herbs, then fried in ale for a rich and savory taste. The steaks are coated in a thickened butter and flour mixture, adding a deliciously crispy texture to the dish.

## Ingredients:
- 4 beef steaks (such as rump or sirloin)
- 1/2 pint (250 ml) ale
- Salt, to taste
- Nutmeg, to taste
- 2 shallots, finely chopped
- 2 tablespoons fresh parsley, finely chopped
- 1 teaspoon fresh thyme leaves, finely chopped
- 1 teaspoon savory, finely chopped
- 2 tablespoons butter
- 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour

## Instructions:
1. In a large skillet, heat the ale over medium heat until it starts to simmer.
2. While the ale is heating, season the beef steaks on both sides with salt and nutmeg.
3. Add the beef steaks to the skillet and fry them in the ale until they are cooked to your desired level of doneness. This will depend on the thickness of the steaks and your personal preference. Remove the steaks from the skillet and set them aside.
4. In the same skillet, add the shallots, parsley, thyme, and savory. Cook them over medium heat until they are softened and fragrant.
5. In a small bowl, mix the butter and flour together until they form a paste.
6. Add the butter and flour mixture to the skillet with the shallots and herbs. Stir well to combine and cook for a few minutes until the mixture thickens.
7. Return the beef steaks to the skillet and coat them with the thickened butter and flour mixture. Cook for an additional minute or two to heat the steaks through and ensure they are well coated.
8. Serve the Ale-Fried Beef Steaks hot with your choice of side dishes.

## Cooking time
Approximately 30 minutes, depending on the desired level of doneness for the beef steaks.
