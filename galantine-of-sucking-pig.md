# Galantine of Sucking Pig

## Description
Galantine of Sucking Pig is a traditional dish made by deboning a whole pig, stuffing it with a flavorful mixture, and then cooking it slowly until tender. The result is a beautiful and impressive centerpiece for a special occasion.

## Options and commentary
- Instead of a whole sucking pig, you can use a boneless pork loin or shoulder roast for a smaller version of the dish.
- Feel free to customize the stuffing mixture with your favorite herbs and spices.
- The cooking time may vary depending on the size of the meat, so use a meat thermometer to ensure it is cooked to the desired doneness.

## Ingredients:
- 1 boneless pork loin or shoulder roast (approximately 2 kg)
- 200g veal, minced
- 200g raw bacon, minced
- Assorted fresh herbs (such as parsley, chives, basil, savory, and thyme), finely chopped
- 2 shallots, finely chopped
- 2 cloves of garlic, minced
- 2 bay leaves
- 100g pistachios, blanched and peeled
- 100g almonds, blanched and peeled
- 6 hard-boiled eggs, yolks only
- 100g mushrooms, finely chopped
- 50g truffles, finely chopped
- 100ml heavy cream
- 1 egg yolk
- Salt and pepper to taste
- Slices of bacon and beef for lining the stew-pan

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 180°C.
2. In a large bowl, combine the minced veal, minced bacon, chopped herbs, shallots, and minced garlic. Mix well to combine.
3. In a small saucepan, bring 1 liter of water to a boil. Add the bay leaves, basil, savory, and thyme. Boil until the liquid reduces to 250ml. Strain the liquid and set aside.
4. In a separate bowl, combine the blanched and peeled pistachios, almonds, and hard-boiled egg yolks. Mix well.
5. Lay out the slices of bacon and beef in the bottom of a stew-pan.
6. Take the boneless pork loin or shoulder roast and butterfly it by making a horizontal cut along the length of the meat, without cutting all the way through. Open up the meat like a book.
7. Spread the veal and bacon mixture evenly over the meat, leaving a border around the edges.
8. Sprinkle the mushroom and truffle mixture over the veal and bacon mixture.
9. Pour the reduced herb-infused liquid and heavy cream over the mushroom and truffle mixture.
10. Brush the edges of the meat with the egg yolk.
11. Starting from one end, roll up the meat tightly, enclosing the stuffing. Use kitchen twine to tie the roll securely.
12. Place the rolled meat on top of the bacon and beef slices in the stew-pan.
13. Cover the stew-pan and cook in the preheated oven for 2-3 hours, or until the internal temperature of the meat reaches 70°C.
14. Once cooked, remove the galantine from the stew-pan and let it cool in the cooking liquid.
15. When the galantine has cooled, remove the twine and slice it into even slices.
16. Arrange the slices on a serving dish lined with a clean napkin.
17. Garnish with slices of lemon and edible flowers, if desired.
18. Serve the galantine cold as a stunning centerpiece for your meal.
