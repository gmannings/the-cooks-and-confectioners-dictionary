# Plum Pudding

## Description
Plum pudding is a traditional British dessert made with suet, dried fruit, flour, and eggs. It is a rich and dense pudding that is typically steamed or boiled. This recipe is a modernized version of an 18th-century plum pudding recipe.

## Options and commentary
- You can use vegetable suet as a modern alternative to animal suet.
- You can add spices like cinnamon, nutmeg, and allspice for extra flavor.
- You can soak the raisins in rum or brandy overnight for a boozy twist.

## Ingredients:
- 300g suet, finely shredded
- 300g raisins
- 6 tablespoons all-purpose flour
- 6 tablespoons sugar
- 8 egg yolks
- 5 egg whites
- A pinch of salt

## Instructions:
1. In a large bowl, combine the shredded suet, raisins, flour, and sugar.
2. In a separate bowl, beat the egg yolks with a pinch of salt until well combined.
3. In another bowl, beat the egg whites until stiff peaks form.
4. Gradually add the beaten egg yolks to the suet mixture, stirring well after each addition.
5. Gently fold in the beaten egg whites into the suet mixture until well combined.
6. Prepare a pudding cloth by boiling it in water and then flouring it.
7. Spoon the pudding mixture into the prepared cloth, leaving enough room for it to expand during cooking.
8. Tie the cloth securely with kitchen twine, making sure it is tightly sealed.
9. Place the pudding in a large pot of boiling water, making sure the water covers the pudding completely.
10. Reduce the heat to a simmer and cover the pot with a lid.
11. Steam the pudding for 4-5 hours, checking occasionally to make sure the water level doesn't get too low. Add more boiling water if needed.
12. Once cooked, carefully remove the pudding from the pot and let it cool slightly before unwrapping.
13. Serve the plum pudding warm with a drizzle of custard or brandy butter.
