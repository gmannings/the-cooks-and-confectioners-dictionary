# Mead

## Description
Mead is an alcoholic beverage made from fermented honey and water. It is one of the oldest known alcoholic beverages and has a sweet and slightly floral flavor.

## Options and commentary
- You can adjust the strength of the mead by reducing the amount of water used.
- Adding galingal, a spice similar to ginger, can give the mead a pleasant taste.

## Ingredients:
- 2 liters of honey
- 11 liters of water
- 1 crusty bread
- Fresh yeast
- Flour
- Optional: galingal (or ginger)

## Instructions:
1. In a large pot, combine the honey and water. Mix well to dissolve the honey.
2. Place the pot on the stove and bring the mixture to a boil. Skim off any brown scum that rises to the surface.
3. Stir in the white scum that forms on top of the mixture.
4. Boil the mixture for 1 hour, stirring occasionally.
5. After 1 hour, remove the pot from the heat and let it cool until it is just blood-warm.
6. While the mixture is cooling, toast the crusty bread on both sides until it is well-browned.
7. Spread fresh yeast on one side of the toasted bread and dust it with flour.
8. Place the bread with yeast and flour into the pot of mead.
9. Cover the pot with a wooden bowl or lid and let it sit for 1-2 days to ferment.
10. If desired, bruise a small amount of galingal or ginger and boil it in the mead, or hang it in a bag in the fermenting vessel to infuse flavor.
11. After 1-2 days, strain the mead to remove any solids and transfer it to bottles or jars for storage.
12. Let the mead age for at least a month before consuming to allow the flavors to develop.

## Cooking time
Approximately 1 hour boiling time + 1-2 days fermentation + at least 1 month aging.
