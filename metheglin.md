9. Stir the mixture again and let it stand for another day.
10. Skim off the yeast again.
11. Transfer the liquid to a cask and place it in a cellar.
12. Cover the cask lightly and provide a vent hole by the bung to release pressure during fermentation.
13. As the liquid continues to ferment, top it up with the same liquid to prevent oxidation.
14. Once fermentation is complete, seal the cask tightly.
