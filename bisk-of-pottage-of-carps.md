# Bisk of Pottage of Carps

## Description
This recipe is for a rich and flavorful fish stew made with carp. The carp is prepared by removing the heads, tongues, and milts, and then the flesh is picked from the bones. The fish is then combined with oysters, hard-boiled egg yolks, and seasonings to create a thick paste. The paste is rolled into balls and stewed with the tongues, milts, anchovies, and more oysters in a mixture of butter, white wine, onion, and lemon juice. Meanwhile, the large carp is marinated in a mixture of white wine vinegar, seasonings, and herbs before being stewed. To serve, the stewed carp is placed in a dish with the heads of the smaller carps, along with the tongues, milts, and oysters. The cooking liquid from the balls, tongues, etc. is poured over the dish, and it is garnished with slices of orange or lemon and pickled barberries.

## Options and commentary
- If carp is not available, you can use another firm-fleshed fish such as cod or haddock.
- Adjust the amount of seasoning according to your taste preferences.
- You can serve the dish with crusty bread or rice to soak up the flavorful broth.

## Ingredients:
- 12 small carps (or substitute with firm-fleshed fish)
- 1 large carp (or substitute with firm-fleshed fish)
- 12 large oysters
- 3-4 hard-boiled eggs
- Salt
- Cloves
- Mace
- 3-4 anchovies
- 20-30 large oysters
- 1/2 pound (225g) fresh butter
- White wine
- 1 onion
- Juice of 1-2 lemons
- White wine vinegar
- Pepper
- Ginger
- Lemon zest
- Bunch of sweet herbs (such as parsley, thyme, and bay leaves)
- Sippets (small pieces of toasted bread)
- Slices of orange or lemon, for garnish
- Pickled barberries, for garnish

## Instructions:
1. Prepare the small carps by drawing them (removing the innards) and removing the milts (male fish reproductive organs). Flay the small carps and cut off their heads. Take out their tongues and pick the flesh from the bones. Set aside.
2. In a bowl, combine the flesh of the small carps with the large oysters and the yolks of the hard-boiled eggs. Season with salt, cloves, and mace. Mash the mixture together until well combined and forms a stiff paste.
3. Roll the paste into balls and set them aside.
4. In a stewpan, combine the tongues and milts of the small carps, anchovies, and the remaining large oysters. Add the butter, white wine, onion, and lemon juice. Set the stewpan over a gentle fire and let it stew.
5. Meanwhile, prepare the large carp by scaling and gutting it. Place the carp and the heads of the small carps in a deep pan. Pour enough white wine vinegar over the fish to cover it and allow it to boil. Season with salt, pepper, ginger, lemon zest, shredded onions, and shredded lemon. Add a bunch of sweet herbs to the pan and let the carp marinate for half an hour.
6. Transfer the marinade liquid with the seasonings to a stewpan. Place the carp in the stewpan when the liquid boils. Let it stew gently for some time, then add the heads of the small carps.
7. When the fish is cooked enough, remove it from the stewpan and set it aside.
8. To serve, place a large silver dish over a chafing dish. Arrange sippets (small pieces of toasted bread) and a ladleful of broth in the dish. Place the large carp in the middle of the dish, surrounded by the heads of the small carps, tongues, milts, and oysters. Pour in the cooking liquid from the stewed balls, tongues, etc. Squeeze in the juice of a Seville orange or lemon. Garnish with slices of orange or lemon and pickled barberries.
9. Serve the Bisk of Pottage of Carps hot.
