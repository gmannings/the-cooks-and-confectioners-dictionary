# The Prince's Potage

## Description
The Prince's Potage is a rich and flavorful soup made with either roasted partridges or capons. The meat is minced and combined with a broth made from the bones, along with a faggot of sweet herbs. The broth is then strained and thickened with soaked bread or almond broth. The potage is garnished with pinions (pine nuts) and finished with a beaten egg mixture. It is served hot and is a delicious and elegant dish.

## Ingredients:
- 2 partridges or capons
- 1 liter good broth (chicken or vegetable)
- 1 faggot of sweet herbs (such as thyme, parsley, and bay leaves)
- 4 slices of bread, soaked in water or almond broth
- Pinions (pine nuts), for garnish
- 3 eggs, beaten
- Salt and pepper, to taste

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 180Â°C.
2. Roast the partridges or capons until cooked through. Remove the meat from the bones and mince it finely.
3. Break the bones and place them in a large pot with the good broth and the faggot of sweet herbs. Bring to a boil and simmer for 1 hour.
4. Strain the broth through a fine mesh sieve or a linen cloth to remove any solids.
5. Return the strained broth to the pot and bring it to a simmer.
6. Squeeze out the excess water from the soaked bread and add it to the simmering broth. Stir well to combine.
7. If using almond broth instead of soaked bread, add it to the simmering broth and stir well.
8. Continue to simmer the potage for another 15-20 minutes, until it thickens slightly.
9. Season the potage with salt and pepper to taste.
10. In a separate bowl, beat the eggs with a little almond broth or any other broth.
11. Slowly pour the beaten egg mixture into the potage, stirring constantly.
12. Hold a hot fire-shovel over the potage to gently cook the eggs.
13. Garnish the potage with pinions (pine nuts).
14. Serve the Prince's Potage hot.
