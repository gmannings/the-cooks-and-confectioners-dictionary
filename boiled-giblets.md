# Boiled Giblets

## Description
Boiled Giblets is a classic dish made from the offal of poultry, such as the heart, liver, and gizzard. The giblets are boiled until tender and then served with a flavorful sauce and accompaniments. This dish is rich in flavor and makes for a hearty and satisfying meal.

## Ingredients:
- Giblets (heart, liver, and gizzard) from poultry
- Water
- Salt
- 2-3 blades of Mace
- Sippets (small pieces of toasted bread)
- Melted Butter
- Scalded Grapes or Gooseberries
- Barberries
- Sliced Lemon

## Instructions:
1. Scald the giblets by pouring boiling water over them. This will help remove any impurities and make them easier to clean.
2. Pick the giblets clean, removing any excess fat or gristle.
3. In a large pot, bring water to a boil and add salt to taste.
4. Add the cleaned giblets and the blades of mace to the boiling water.
5. Reduce the heat to a simmer and cook the giblets until they are tender. This will take approximately 1-2 hours, depending on the size and freshness of the giblets. Skim off any foam or impurities that rise to the surface during cooking.
6. While the giblets are cooking, prepare the accompaniments. Toast small pieces of bread until they are crispy to make sippets.
7. In a separate saucepan, melt butter until it is liquid and smooth.
8. If using grapes or gooseberries, scald them by briefly immersing them in boiling water and then draining.
9. Once the giblets are tender, remove them from the cooking liquid and set them aside.
10. Strain the cooking liquid to remove any solids and return it to the pot.
11. Bring the cooking liquid to a boil and reduce it until it thickens slightly to create a flavorful sauce.
12. To serve, place the sippets on a plate and arrange the boiled giblets on top.
13. Drizzle the melted butter over the giblets and sippets.
14. Garnish with scalded grapes or gooseberries, barberries, and sliced lemon.
15. Pour the thickened cooking liquid over the giblets and serve hot.

## Cooking time
Approximately 1-2 hours for cooking the giblets.
