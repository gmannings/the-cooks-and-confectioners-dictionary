# Candied Barberries

## Description
Candied barberries are a sweet and tart treat made by coating barberries with sugar and drying them. They make a great topping for desserts or can be enjoyed on their own as a snack.

## Ingredients:
- Barberries (removed from the syrup)
- Fine sugar

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 120°C (250°F) or set a stove to low heat.
2. Take the barberries out of the syrup and wash off any remaining syrup with warm water.
3. Place the barberries in a bowl and sift some fine sugar over them, ensuring they are evenly coated.
4. Transfer the sugar-coated barberries to a baking sheet if using the oven, or a heatproof dish if using a stove.
5. Place the barberries in the oven or over the stove on low heat.
6. Move the barberries around every 10 minutes to ensure even drying and prevent sticking.
7. Sprinkle additional sugar over the barberries each time you move them.
8. Continue drying the barberries until they are completely dry and no longer sticky to the touch. This may take 1-2 hours.
9. Once dry, remove the candied barberries from the oven or stove and let them cool completely.
10. Store the candied barberries in an airtight container.
