# Almond Jumbles

## Description
Almond Jumbles are a sweet treat made from blanched almonds, sugar, and eggs. They have a chewy texture and a delicate almond flavor. These jumbles are perfect for a tea party or as a homemade gift.

## Ingredients:
- 1 pound blanched almonds
- 2 pounds powdered sugar
- Rosewater
- Whites of eggs

## Instructions:
1. Blanch the almonds by placing them in boiling water for a few minutes, then drain and remove the skins.
2. In a mortar and pestle or a food processor, grind the blanched almonds until they form a fine powder.
3. In a large bowl, combine the powdered almonds with the powdered sugar.
4. Add a few drops of rosewater to the almond and sugar mixture and mix well. The rosewater should be added gradually until the mixture reaches a thick, paste-like consistency.
5. In a separate bowl, beat the whites of the eggs until they form a froth.
6. Gradually add the beaten egg whites to the almond and sugar mixture, stirring continuously until the mixture becomes stiff and can be formed into a paste.
7. Allow the mixture to cool completely.
8. Sprinkle sugar on pewter plates or baking sheets.
9. Take small portions of the almond paste and roll them into small balls, about the size of a walnut.
10. Place the almond balls onto the sugar-coated plates or baking sheets.
11. Let the jumbles sit at room temperature for a few hours or overnight until they are firm and dry.
