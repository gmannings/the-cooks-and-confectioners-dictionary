# Preserved Plums

## Description
This recipe is for preserving plums to enjoy them throughout the year. The plums are cooked in a sugar syrup and then dried in a stove to remove excess moisture.

## Ingredients:
- Plums
- Sugar

## Instructions:
1. Wash the plums and remove the stones.
2. Slit each plum with a small knife.
3. In a large copper pan, combine the plums and an equal amount of sugar (for every pound of fruit, use a pound of sugar).
4. Place the pan over medium heat and stir the mixture continuously to prevent the plum skins from breaking.
5. Allow the plums to simmer for a good while until they are cooked through. 
6. Remove the pan from the heat and let the mixture cool.
7. Place a sieve or colander over a bowl and drain the plums, reserving the syrup.
8. In the meantime, return the syrup to the pan and boil it until it reaches a smooth consistency.
9. Carefully place the plums back into the syrup and bring it to a boil. Repeat this process seven or eight times, skimming off any impurities that rise to the surface.
10. Once the plums have been boiled multiple times, remove them from the syrup and transfer them to earthen pans.
11. Allow the plums to stand in a stove overnight.
12. The next morning, when the plums are cold, drain them from any remaining syrup.
13. Arrange the plums on slates and place them in the stove to dry.

## Cooking time
- Cooking the plums in the syrup: approximately 1 hour
- Drying the plums in the stove: overnight
