# Pickled Beans

## Description
This recipe is for pickling beans in a flavorful vinegar brine. The beans are first soaked in vinegar and salt, then boiled with allom (a type of mineral salt) and fennel. After boiling, the beans are cooled and layered in a pot with a variety of spices, including cloves, mace, pepper, ginger, fennel, and dill. The pot is then filled with wine vinegar to complete the pickling process.

## Ingredients:
- Beans
- Vinegar
- Salt
- Allom (optional, can be omitted if not available)
- Fennel
- Cloves
- Mace
- Pepper
- Ginger
- Dill
- Wine vinegar

## Instructions:
1. Pick off the stalks of the beans and discard them.
2. In a large container, combine the beans with enough vinegar and salt to fully submerge them. Let the beans soak in this mixture for nine to ten days.
3. After the soaking period, drain the beans and rinse them well.
4. In a pot, bring water to a boil and add the beans, allom (if using), and a little fennel. Boil the beans until they are cooked to your desired tenderness.
5. Once the beans are cooked, remove them from the pot and set them aside to cool.
6. Once the beans have cooled, layer them in a clean, sterilized pot. Between each layer of beans, sprinkle a mixture of cloves, mace, pepper, ginger, fennel, and dill.
7. After layering the beans and spices, fill the pot with good-quality wine vinegar until the beans are completely covered.
8. Seal the pot tightly and store it in a cool, dark place for at least a month to allow the flavors to develop.

## Cooking time
- Soaking time: 9-10 days
- Boiling time: varies depending on desired tenderness of beans
