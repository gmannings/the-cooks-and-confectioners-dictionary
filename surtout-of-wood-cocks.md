# Surtout of Wood-cocks

## Description
Surtout of Wood-cocks is a dish made with woodcocks that are stuffed with a flavorful mixture of ham, bacon, veal sweetbreads, mushrooms, truffles, herbs, and garlic. The woodcocks are then roasted and served with a ragout sauce.

## Ingredients:
- 4 woodcocks
- 100g boiled ham
- 100g raw bacon
- 100g veal sweetbreads
- 50g mushrooms
- 50g truffles
- 2 cives (chives)
- 2 tablespoons parsley, finely chopped
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 2 egg yolks
- Salt and pepper to taste
- 4 larded fricandeaux (small larded meat rolls)
- Cooking oil or butter for roasting
- For the ragout sauce:
  - 1 tablespoon butter
  - 1 tablespoon all-purpose flour
  - 250ml chicken or veal stock
  - Salt and pepper to taste

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 180째C (350째F).
2. In a food processor, combine the boiled ham, raw bacon, veal sweetbreads, mushrooms, truffles, cives, parsley, and garlic. Pulse until finely chopped.
3. Transfer the mixture to a bowl and add the egg yolks. Season with salt and pepper. Mix well to combine.
4. Take each woodcock and carefully stuff the mixture into their bellies and between the skin and flesh of their breasts. Use your fingers or a small spoon to evenly distribute the stuffing.
5. Place a larded fricandeau on the breast of each woodcock and secure them with kitchen twine.
6. Wrap each woodcock tightly in parchment paper, making sure they are completely covered.
7. Heat a little cooking oil or butter in a roasting pan over medium-high heat. Add the wrapped woodcocks and sear them on all sides until browned.
8. Transfer the roasting pan to the preheated oven and roast the woodcocks for about 20-25 minutes, or until cooked through. The internal temperature should reach 65째C (150째F).
9. While the woodcocks are roasting, prepare the ragout sauce. In a small saucepan, melt the butter over medium heat. Add the flour and cook for 1-2 minutes, stirring constantly.
10. Gradually whisk in the chicken or veal stock, making sure there are no lumps. Cook the sauce until it thickens, stirring occasionally. Season with salt and pepper to taste.
11. Once the woodcocks are cooked, remove them from the oven and carefully unwrap them from the parchment paper.
12. Place the woodcocks on a serving platter and pour the ragout sauce over them.
13. Serve the Surtout of Wood-cocks immediately.
