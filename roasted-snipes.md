# Roasted Snipes

## Description
Roasted Snipes are small game birds that are traditionally roasted with a flavorful sauce. This recipe gives you two options: roasting the snipes with a bread and butter sauce, or making a sauce with the minced guts of the snipes. Both options result in a delicious and savory dish.

## Options and commentary
- You can choose to draw the snipes (remove the innards) or leave them intact. If you draw them, you can stuff each snipe with an onion before roasting. If you don't draw them, you will use the minced guts to make a sauce.
- The original recipe calls for Claret, which is a red wine. You can use any dry red wine as a substitute.
- Anchovy adds a savory flavor to the sauce, but if you don't have it or prefer not to use it, you can omit it.
- The recipe mentions using grated bread. You can use breadcrumbs as a modern alternative.
- The cooking time will depend on the size of the snipes, but it is typically around 20-30 minutes.

## Ingredients:
- 4 snipes
- 4 onions (optional, for stuffing)
- 1 cup dry red wine (Claret)
- 1 tablespoon vinegar
- Salt and pepper to taste
- 1 anchovy fillet (optional)
- 1 cup breadcrumbs
- 2 tablespoons butter

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F).
2. If you choose to draw the snipes, remove the innards and rinse the birds under cold water. If not, proceed to the next step.
3. If using onions for stuffing, peel and quarter them. Stuff each snipe with an onion quarter.
4. Place the snipes in a roasting pan.
5. In a small bowl, mix together the red wine, vinegar, salt, pepper, and anchovy (if using).
6. Pour the wine mixture into the roasting pan, around the snipes.
7. Place the roasting pan in the preheated oven and roast the snipes for about 20-30 minutes, or until they are cooked through and golden brown.
8. While the snipes are roasting, prepare the sauce. If you drew the snipes, skip to step 10.
9. Mince the guts of the snipes very finely.
10. In a saucepan, combine the minced guts, red wine, salt, pepper, and a knob of butter. Cook over medium heat until the sauce thickens slightly, about 5 minutes.
11. In a separate small saucepan, melt the remaining butter.
12. Add the breadcrumbs to the melted butter and cook, stirring constantly, until the breadcrumbs are golden brown and toasted.
13. Remove the snipes from the oven and transfer them to a serving platter.
14. Pour the pan drippings into the saucepan with the minced guts sauce. Stir well to combine.
15. Add the toasted breadcrumbs to the saucepan and mix everything together.
16. Pour the sauce over the roasted snipes and serve immediately.

## Cooking time
Approximately 20-30 minutes.
