# Duiddany of Plums

## Description
Duiddany of Plums is a sweet and tangy jelly-like preserve made with preserved plums and fresh plums. It has a rich plum flavor and a smooth, jelly-like texture. It can be used as a spread on toast, scones, or biscuits, or as a filling for pastries and cakes.

## Ingredients:
- 1 quart (946 ml) of preserved plum juice
- 1 pound (454 g) of fresh plums, pitted and chopped
- 1 pound (454 g) of sugar

## Instructions:
1. In a large saucepan, combine the preserved plum juice, fresh plums, and sugar.
2. Place the saucepan over medium heat and bring the mixture to a boil.
3. Reduce the heat to low and simmer the mixture, stirring occasionally, until it thickens and can stand up on a knife-point like a jelly. This will take approximately 1-2 hours.
4. Remove the saucepan from the heat and let the mixture cool slightly.
5. Pour the duiddany of plums into sterilized jars and seal tightly.
6. Allow the duiddany of plums to cool completely before storing in the refrigerator.
