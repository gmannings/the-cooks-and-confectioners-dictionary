# Custard

## Description
This recipe is for a classic custard dessert. It involves boiling cream, sweetening it with sugar, and adding egg yolks and orange water for flavor. The mixture is then strained and baked in individual crusts or cups.

## Ingredients:
- 1 liter of cream
- 200 grams of fine powdered sugar
- 6 egg yolks
- 2 tablespoons of orange water

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 180Â°C.
2. In a saucepan, heat the cream over medium heat until it comes to a boil.
3. Add the powdered sugar to the boiling cream and stir until it is fully dissolved.
4. In a separate bowl, beat the egg yolks with the orange water until well combined.
5. Slowly pour the egg yolk mixture into the hot cream, stirring constantly to prevent curdling.
6. Continue to cook the mixture over low heat, stirring constantly, until it thickens slightly. This should take about 5 minutes.
7. Remove the custard mixture from the heat and strain it through a sieve to remove any lumps.
8. Pour the custard into individual crusts or cups, filling them about three-quarters full.
9. Place the filled crusts or cups on a baking sheet and carefully transfer them to the preheated oven.
10. Bake the custards for about 30 minutes, or until they are set and lightly golden on top.
11. Remove the custards from the oven and allow them to cool completely before serving.
