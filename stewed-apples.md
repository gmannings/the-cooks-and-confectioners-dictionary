# Stewed Apples

## Description
Stewed apples are a classic dessert that can be enjoyed on their own or used as a topping for various dishes. This recipe involves cooking sliced apples in a mixture of water and red wine, along with warm spices like cinnamon and cloves. The apples are then sweetened with sugar, mashed to a smooth consistency, and finished with a knob of butter for added richness.

## Ingredients:
- 4 apples (any variety suitable for cooking)
- 1 cup water
- 1 cup red wine
- 1 stick of cinnamon
- 4 cloves
- 2 tablespoons sugar (adjust to taste)
- 2 tablespoons unsalted butter

## Instructions:
1. Peel the apples and cut them into slices.
2. In a medium-sized pot or saucepan, combine the water and red wine in equal quantities. The liquid should be enough to barely cover the apple slices.
3. Add the apple slices to the pot and place it over medium heat.
4. Add the stick of cinnamon and cloves to the pot.
5. Allow the mixture to come to a simmer and then reduce the heat to low.
6. Let the apples stew gently for about 15-20 minutes, or until they are tender and easily pierced with a fork.
7. Once the apples are tender, add the sugar to the pot and stir well to dissolve.
8. Mash the apples with a fork or potato masher until they reach a smooth, sauce-like consistency.
9. Add the unsalted butter to the pot and stir until it melts and incorporates into the stewed apples.
10. Taste the stewed apples and adjust the sweetness by adding more sugar if desired.
11. Remove the pot from the heat and let the stewed apples cool slightly before serving.
