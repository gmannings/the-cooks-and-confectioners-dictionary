# Biskets

## Description
Biskets are a type of sweet biscuit that were popular in the 18th century. They are made with eggs, sugar, flour, and coriander seeds. The batter is baked in the oven until golden and then brushed with a mixture of eggs and sugar for added sweetness.

## Ingredients:
- 8 eggs
- 1 tablespoon rose water
- 2 tablespoons sack (a type of fortified wine)
- 1 pound (450 grams) fine sugar
- 1 pound (450 grams) all-purpose flour
- 1/2 ounce (14 grams) coriander seeds
- Butter, for greasing pans

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 350°F (180°C).
2. In a large mixing bowl, beat together the eggs, rose water, sack, and fine sugar for about an hour, until well combined and slightly frothy.
3. Add the flour and coriander seeds to the bowl and continue to beat the mixture until everything is well incorporated and the batter is smooth.
4. Grease your baking pans with butter.
5. Pour the batter into the prepared pans, filling them about halfway.
6. Place the pans in the preheated oven and bake for 30 minutes.
7. After 30 minutes, remove the pans from the oven and carefully turn the biskets over.
8. In a small bowl, mix together a little bit of the remaining beaten eggs and sugar.
9. Brush the tops of the biskets with the egg and sugar mixture.
10. Return the pans to the oven and bake for an additional 15 minutes, or until the biskets are golden brown and cooked through.
11. Remove the biskets from the oven and let them cool completely before serving.
