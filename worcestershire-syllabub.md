# Worcestershire Syllabub

## Description
Worcestershire Syllabub is a traditional English dessert made with cider, sugar, nutmeg, and cream. It is a light and frothy dessert with a tangy and sweet flavor.

## Options and commentary
- You can use any type of cider, but a dry cider works best for this recipe.
- If you don't have nutmeg, you can substitute it with a pinch of cinnamon or allspice for a different flavor.
- For a modern twist, you can add a splash of lemon juice or zest to brighten up the flavors.
- If you prefer a sweeter dessert, you can increase the amount of sugar according to your taste.

## Ingredients:
- 500 ml cider
- 100 grams sugar
- 1/4 teaspoon nutmeg
- 250 ml thick cream

## Instructions:
1. In a large bowl or syllabub-pot, combine the cider, sugar, and nutmeg. Stir well until the sugar is dissolved.
2. Slowly pour in the thick cream, adding it in two or three spoonfuls at a time, as if you were milking it. 
3. Gently stir the mixture in a circular motion to incorporate the cream into the cider mixture.
4. Let the mixture stand at room temperature for two hours to allow the flavors to meld and the mixture to thicken.
5. Once the Worcestershire Syllabub has set, give it a final gentle stir to combine any separated layers.
6. Serve the syllabub in individual dessert glasses or bowls.
7. Optionally, you can garnish with a sprinkle of nutmeg or a twist of lemon zest for added flavor and presentation.
