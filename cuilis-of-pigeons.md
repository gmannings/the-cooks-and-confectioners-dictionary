# Cuilis of Pigeons

## Description
Cuilis of Pigeons is a rich and flavorful dish made with roasted pigeons and a variety of aromatic ingredients such as mushrooms, truffles, onions, parsley, capers, and anchovies. The mixture is cooked in melted lard and then simmered in a savory gravy, which is strained and thickened. The dish is finished with a touch of lemon juice for a tangy flavor.

## Ingredients:
- 3-4 roasted pigeons
- 100g mushrooms, finely chopped
- 50g truffles, finely chopped
- 1 small onion, finely chopped
- 2 tablespoons parsley, finely chopped
- 2-3 rocambolles, finely chopped (optional)
- 1 tablespoon capers, finely chopped
- 3-4 anchovies, finely chopped
- 2 tablespoons lard or cooking oil
- 250ml good quality gravy
- Juice of 1 lemon
- Salt and pepper to taste

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 180Â°C.
2. Roast the pigeons in the preheated oven until cooked through, about 30-40 minutes. Remove from the oven and let them cool slightly.
3. Once the pigeons have cooled, remove the meat from the bones and place it in a mortar. Pound the meat until it becomes a smooth paste.
4. In a large stew-pan, heat the lard or cooking oil over medium heat.
5. Add the chopped mushrooms, truffles, onion, parsley, rocambolles (if using), capers, and anchovies to the pan. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the vegetables are softened and fragrant.
6. Add the pounded pigeon meat to the pan and mix well with the vegetables.
7. Pour in the gravy and stir to combine. Simmer the mixture over low heat for about 10 minutes to allow the flavors to meld together.
8. Strain the mixture through a fine-mesh sieve to remove any lumps or large pieces. Return the strained mixture to the pan.
9. Add the lemon juice to the pan and stir well. Taste and adjust the seasoning with salt and pepper if needed.
10. If desired, thicken the sauce by adding a small amount of cornstarch or flour mixed with water. Stir well and cook for an additional 2-3 minutes until the sauce thickens.
11. Serve the Cuilis of Pigeons hot with your choice of side dishes, such as mashed potatoes or steamed vegetables.
