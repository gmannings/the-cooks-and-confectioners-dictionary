# Elder Vinegar

## Description
Elder vinegar is a flavorful and aromatic vinegar made by infusing dried elderflowers in wine vinegar. It adds a unique floral and fruity note to dressings, marinades, and sauces.

## Ingredients:
- Dried elderflowers
- Good quality wine vinegar

## Instructions:
1. Sterilize stone or double glass bottles by washing them with hot, soapy water and rinsing them thoroughly.
2. Place the dried elderflowers into the sterilized bottles, filling them about halfway.
3. Pour the wine vinegar into the bottles, filling them to the top.
4. Seal the bottles tightly with their lids or corks.
5. Place the bottles in a sunny spot or near a warm fire to allow the elderflowers to infuse their flavor into the vinegar.
6. Leave the bottles undisturbed for at least 2 weeks, but preferably up to 4 weeks, to allow the elderflowers to fully extract their essence into the vinegar.
7. After the desired infusion time, strain the vinegar through a fine-mesh sieve or cheesecloth to remove the elderflowers.
8. Transfer the infused elder vinegar into clean, sterilized bottles or jars for storage.
9. Label the bottles with the date and contents.
10. Store the elder vinegar in a cool, dark place for up to 6 months.

## Cooking time
2-4 weeks for infusion, plus additional time for storage.
