# Blanc-Mangers

## Description
Blanc-Mangers are a type of dessert or side dish that were commonly used in the 18th century. They can be served as a part of an intermediate course, as a side dish, or as a standalone dessert. Blanc-Mangers are made from sweet almonds and jelly, resulting in a creamy and smooth texture.

## Options and commentary
- You can serve Blanc-Mangers as a standalone dessert by layering them between plain jelly or by placing them in a china bowl for a more elegant presentation.
- Alternatively, you can serve Blanc-Mangers as a side dish by placing them in cold plates as part of the second course of a meal.

## Ingredients:
- 1 pound (450g) sweet almonds
- Scalding water
- Jelly (approximately 1 quart or 3 pints)

## Instructions:
1. Place the sweet almonds in a bowl and pour scalding water over them. Allow them to sit in the hot water for a few minutes.
2. Drain the almonds and remove the husks. You can easily remove the husks by gently squeezing the almonds between your fingers.
3. Place the husked almonds in a stone mortar and pound them into a fine paste. To prevent the almonds from oiling, add a spoonful of jelly to the mortar occasionally while pounding.
4. Once the almonds are finely beaten and have formed a smooth paste, transfer them to a clean saucepan.
5. Add a quart or three pints of jelly to the saucepan with the almonds. 
6. Place the saucepan on the stove and heat the mixture until it is scalding hot. Use a wooden ladle to break up the almonds and mix them with the jelly.
7. Strain the mixture either through a woollen strainer or a napkin. Use the ladle to press the almonds through the strainer as much as possible.
8. Repeat the process of putting the jelly back onto the almonds and pressing them through the strainer three or four times. This will help thicken the Blanc-Manger to a creamy consistency.
9. If the Blanc-Manger is served cold, it may tend to separate with the jelly falling to the bottom and the almonds floating on top. To avoid this, place the Blanc-Manger in jelly glasses.
10. Serve the Blanc-Mangers as desired, either as a standalone dessert, layered between plain jelly, in a china bowl for the middle of the dish, or in cold plates for the second course.
