# Whisked Syllabub

## Description
Whisked Syllabub is a light and frothy dessert that originated in the 18th century. It is made with cream, wine, sugar, and egg whites, resulting in a refreshing and creamy treat.

## Ingredients:
- 1 liter of heavy cream
- 250 ml of sweet white wine (such as Moscato or Riesling)
- 4 egg whites
- 200 grams of fine sugar

## Instructions:
1. In a large mixing bowl, combine the heavy cream, sweet white wine, and fine sugar.
2. Using a whisk, beat the mixture vigorously until it becomes frothy and forms soft peaks.
3. In a separate bowl, whisk the egg whites until they form stiff peaks.
4. Gently fold the whisked egg whites into the frothy cream mixture.
5. Once well combined, use a spoon or ladle to skim off any excess froth from the top.
6. Pour the whisked syllabub into individual serving glasses or bowls.
7. Refrigerate for at least 2 hours to allow the syllabub to set and chill.
8. Serve cold and enjoy!

## Options and commentary
- You can add a splash of lemon juice or zest to add a hint of citrus flavor to the syllabub.
- For a non-alcoholic version, you can substitute the sweet white wine with grape juice or apple cider.
- Feel free to garnish the syllabub with a sprinkle of nutmeg or a fresh berry for added visual appeal.
