# Preserved Venison

## Description
Preserved Venison is a method of preserving venison for long periods of time. The meat is parboiled, seasoned, and then baked in a pot with butter. After baking, the pot is weighted down until the venison is cold. The butter is then spread on top of the venison and the pot is sealed. This dish can be enjoyed throughout the year.

## Ingredients:
- 1 haunch of venison
- Salt
- 1 tablespoon of pepper
- 2 nutmegs
- 2 tablespoons of white wine vinegar
- 2 pounds of butter
- Bay leaves

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 350°F (180°C).
2. Parboil the haunch of venison for a short time.

4. Make holes in the meat for larding and fill the holes with the seasoned vinegar.
5. Place the venison in a pot with the fat side facing downwards.
6. Cover the venison with 2 pounds of butter.
7. Close the pot with a coarse paste to seal it.
8. Bake the pot in the preheated oven for about 2-3 hours, or until the venison is cooked through.
9. Remove the crust from the pot and place a round board on top of the venison.
10. Place a weight on the board to press the venison down until it is cold.
11. Once the venison is cold, remove the board and spread the butter on top of the venison.
