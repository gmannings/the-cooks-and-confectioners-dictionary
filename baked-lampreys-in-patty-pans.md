# Baked Lampreys in Patty-pans

## Description
This recipe is for baking lampreys, a type of eel-like fish, in individual patty-pans. The lampreys are first roasted and then placed in the patty-pans with a mixture of herbs, spices, and fruits. They are then baked until cooked through and moistened with a choice of white wine, butter, or sack (a type of fortified wine) and sugar.

## Ingredients:
- 4 lampreys
- Butter, for basting and greasing
- Salt
- Pepper
- Nutmeg
- Savory herbs (such as thyme, rosemary, or parsley), shredded
- Dates, pitted and chopped
- Currants
- Lemon, sliced
- White wine, butter, or sack (fortified wine)
- Sugar

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F).
2. Roast the lampreys until they are tender, basting them with butter during the roasting process.
3. Once the lampreys are cooked, remove them from the roasting pan and allow them to cool slightly.
4. Grease the bottoms of the patty-pans with butter.
5. Place the roasted lampreys into the patty-pans.
6. Season the lampreys with salt, pepper, nutmeg, and the shredded savory herbs.
7. Add the chopped dates, currants, and slices of lemon to the patty-pans.
8. Close the patty-pans to seal the lampreys and the filling inside.
9. Place the patty-pans in the preheated oven and bake for approximately 20-25 minutes, or until the lampreys are fully cooked and the patty-pans are golden brown.
10. Once baked, remove the patty-pans from the oven and moisten the lampreys with a choice of white wine, melted butter, or sack and sugar. Use a brush or spoon to evenly distribute the liquid over the lampreys.
11. Serve the baked lampreys in the patty-pans while still warm.
