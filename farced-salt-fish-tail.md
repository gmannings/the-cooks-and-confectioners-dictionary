# Farced Salt Fish Tail

## Description
This recipe is for a dish called "Farced Salt Fish Tail" from the 18th century. It involves stuffing the tail of a salt fish with a mixture of minced carp, eel, mushrooms, cream, eggs, and various seasonings. The stuffed tail is then cooked in a ragout made with mushrooms, truffles, fish broth, and crayfish cullis. The dish is finished by baking it until it is a golden brown color. It can be served as a first course.

## Options and commentary
- Instead of using a salt fish tail, you can use any firm white fish fillet.
- If you don't have access to carp or eel, you can use other white fish fillets as a substitute.
- You can adjust the seasonings and spices according to your taste preferences.
- The dish can be served with a side of vegetables or a salad.

## Ingredients:
- 1 salt fish tail (or firm white fish fillet)
- Flesh of 1 carp (or other white fish fillet)
- Flesh of 1/2 eel (or other white fish fillet)
- 100g mushrooms, minced
- 100ml cream
- 3-4 raw egg yolks
- Salt and pepper to taste
- Spices (such as nutmeg, cloves, or allspice) to taste
- 1 tablespoon minced chives
- 1 tablespoon minced parsley
- 50g sweet butter
- 1 tablespoon flour
- 100g mushrooms, sliced
- 50g truffles, sliced
- 200ml fish broth
- 100ml crayfish cullis
- Melted butter for brushing
- Grated bread for sprinkling

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 180Â°C.
2. Boil the salt fish tail (or white fish fillet) until cooked. Remove the flesh in flakes, keeping the bone intact with the end of the tail.
3. In a mixing bowl, combine the minced carp, minced eel, minced mushrooms, cream, raw egg yolks, salt, pepper, spices, minced chives, minced parsley, and sweet butter. Mix well.
4. Pound the mixture in a mortar until well combined.
5. In a saucepan, brown some butter with flour. Add the sliced mushrooms and truffles. Cook for a few minutes.
6. Add the fish broth to the saucepan and let it simmer for a while. Skim off any fat that rises to the surface.
7. Add the fish flakes and carp milts to the saucepan. Stir in the crayfish cullis to bind the mixture. Set aside to cool.
8. Place the bone of the salt fish tail (or white fish fillet) in a dish or pastry pan. Shape the farce mixture around it to resemble a salt fish tail. Create a rim around it, about 2-3 inches high.
9. Pour the ragout mixture into the rimmed farce. Smooth the top with a knife dipped in beaten egg.
10. Brush the top with melted butter and sprinkle with grated bread.
11. Place the dish or pastry pan in the preheated oven and bake until the top is a golden brown color.
12. Serve the farced salt fish tail hot as a first course.
