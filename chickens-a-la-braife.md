# Chickens a la Braife

## Description
Chickens a la Braife is a classic French dish that involves parboiling chickens and then braising them with bacon and beef. The chicken is seasoned with herbs and spices and cooked slowly in a stew-pan. A ragout of veal sweetbreads, mushrooms, and truffles is prepared separately and served with the chicken. The dish is rich and flavorful, with tender chicken and a savory ragout.

## Options and commentary
- Instead of larding the chickens with bacon and ham, you can use bacon strips to wrap around the chicken breasts.
- If you don't have access to veal sweetbreads, you can substitute them with chicken or pork sweetbreads, or omit them altogether.
- You can add other vegetables to the ragout, such as carrots or pearl onions, for added flavor and texture.
- Serve the dish with mashed potatoes or crusty bread to soak up the delicious sauce.

## Ingredients:
- 2 whole chickens
- 200g bacon, sliced into strips
- 200g ham, sliced into strips
- 200g beef, sliced into stakes
- Salt and pepper to taste
- 1 bunch of fresh herbs (such as thyme, rosemary, and parsley)
- 200g veal sweetbreads, cut into pieces
- 100g cockscombs
- 100g mushrooms, sliced
- 50g truffles, sliced
- 200ml chicken or veal stock
- 200g artichoke bottoms, quartered and blanched
- 200g asparagus tops
- 50g butter
- 50g all-purpose flour

## Instructions:
1. Parboil the chickens by placing them in a large pot of boiling water for about 10 minutes. Remove the chickens from the pot and let them cool slightly.
2. Preheat the oven to 180Â°C.
3. Lard the chickens by inserting strips of bacon and ham into the chicken breasts. Tie the chickens with kitchen twine to secure the lardons.
4. In a large stew-pan, arrange a layer of bacon strips and beef stakes at the bottom. Season them with salt and pepper.
5. Place the chickens in the stew-pan with the breasts facing downwards. Season the chickens with salt and pepper.
6. Add another layer of beef stakes and bacon strips on top of the chickens.
7. Place the stew-pan on the stove over medium heat. Cook the chickens with fire both over and under them for about 10 minutes, until the bacon and beef start to brown.
8. In a separate saucepan, melt the butter and add the veal sweetbreads, cockscombs, mushrooms, and truffles. Season with salt, pepper, and the fresh herbs. Cook them for a few minutes until they are slightly browned.
9. Add the chicken or veal stock to the saucepan and let the mixture simmer over low heat.
10. After the ragout has been simmering for about 15 minutes, add the blanched artichoke bottoms and asparagus tops. Continue simmering for another 10 minutes.
11. In a small bowl, mix the flour with a little water to make a slurry.
12. Remove the fat from the ragout and gradually add the slurry to thicken the sauce. Stir well to combine.
13. Drain the chickens from the stew-pan and add them to the ragout. Let them simmer together for a few minutes to absorb the flavors.
14. Remove the chickens from the ragout and remove the kitchen twine. Arrange the chickens on a serving dish.
15. Pour the ragout over the chickens and serve hot.
