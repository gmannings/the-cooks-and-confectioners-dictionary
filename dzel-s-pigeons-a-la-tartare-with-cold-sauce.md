# Dzel's Pigeons a la Tartare with Cold Sauce

## Description
This recipe is for a classic dish of flattened and seasoned pigeons, grilled to perfection, and served with a tangy cold sauce. The pigeons are seasoned with salt, pepper, and cloves, coated in melted butter and grated bread, and then grilled until cooked through. The cold sauce is made with minced onion or shallot, anchovy, pickles, parsley, salt, pepper, oil, water, lemon juice, and mustard. The sauce is poured over the grilled pigeons and served as a first course.

## Options and commentary
- Instead of pigeons, you can use chicken breasts or quail for a similar dish.
- If you prefer a spicier sauce, you can add a pinch of cayenne pepper or a dash of hot sauce.
- You can adjust the amount of lemon juice and mustard in the sauce to suit your taste preferences.

## Ingredients:
- 4 pigeons
- Salt
- Pepper
- Cloves
- 4 tablespoons melted butter
- 1 cup grated bread
- 1 small onion or shallot
- 1 anchovy fillet
- 2 tablespoons pickles (such as gherkins), finely chopped
- 1 tablespoon minced parsley
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 1/4 teaspoon pepper
- 5-6 tablespoons olive oil
- 1 tablespoon water
- Juice of 1 lemon
- 1 tablespoon mustard

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the grill or preheat the oven to 200°C (400°F) if using the oven.
2. Prepare the pigeons by removing the feathers and trussing them as if for boiling.
3. Flatten the pigeons by placing them on a cutting board and gently pounding them with a meat cleaver until they are as thin as possible without breaking the skin on the backs or breasts.
4. Season the pigeons with salt, pepper, and cloves on both sides.
5. Dip each pigeon in melted butter, making sure to coat it evenly.
6. Coat each pigeon with grated bread, pressing the bread crumbs onto the surface to adhere.
7. If using a grill, place the pigeons on a preheated grill and cook for about 8-10 minutes per side, or until cooked through. If using the oven, place the pigeons on a buttered baking sheet and bake for about 15-20 minutes, or until cooked through.
8. While the pigeons are cooking, prepare the cold sauce. Finely mince the onion or shallot, anchovy, pickles, and parsley separately.
9. In a bowl, combine the minced onion or shallot, anchovy, pickles, parsley, salt, pepper, olive oil, water, and lemon juice. Mix well.
10. Just before serving, stir in the mustard into the sauce.
11. Once the pigeons are cooked, remove them from the grill or oven and let them rest for a few minutes.
12. Pour the cold sauce into a serving dish.
13. Place the grilled pigeons on top of the sauce.
14. Serve the dish as a first course.
