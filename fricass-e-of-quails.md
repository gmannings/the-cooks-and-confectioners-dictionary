# Fricassée of Quails

## Description
Fricassée of Quails is a classic French dish that involves cooking quails in a flavorful sauce made with mushrooms, truffles, and herbs. The quails are first browned in bacon fat and then simmered in a mixture of gravy and wine until tender. The dish is typically served with a rich sauce and can be enjoyed as a main course.

## Ingredients:
- 4 quails
- 4 slices of ham
- 100g mushrooms, sliced
- 50g truffles, sliced
- 50g morels, sliced
- 2 slices of bacon, diced
- Salt and pepper to taste
- 4 cloves
- 1 faggot of fresh herbs (such as thyme, parsley, and bay leaves)
- 250ml chicken or veal stock
- 100ml white wine
- 2 tablespoons flour
- 2 tablespoons butter
- 2 egg yolks
- 1 tablespoon verjuice (or lemon juice)

## Instructions:
1. In a large saucepan, heat the diced bacon over medium heat until crispy. Remove the bacon and set aside, leaving the bacon fat in the pan.
2. Season the quails with salt, pepper, and cloves.
3. Add the quails to the saucepan and brown them on all sides in the bacon fat. Remove the quails and set aside.
4. In the same saucepan, add the ham, mushrooms, truffles, and morels. Cook for a few minutes until the mushrooms are tender.
5. Return the quails to the saucepan and add the faggot of fresh herbs.
6. Sprinkle the flour over the quails and vegetables, stirring to coat everything evenly.
7. Add the chicken or veal stock and white wine to the saucepan. Stir well to combine.
8. Reduce the heat to low and simmer the quails for about 30 minutes, or until they are cooked through and tender.
9. In a small bowl, mix the egg yolks with a few tablespoons of the cooking liquid from the saucepan. Stir well to combine.
10. Gradually add the egg yolk mixture back into the saucepan, stirring constantly. This will help thicken the sauce.
11. Stir in the crispy bacon and verjuice (or lemon juice) to the saucepan. Cook for another 2-3 minutes to heat through.
12. Remove the faggot of fresh herbs from the saucepan before serving.
13. Serve the fricassée of quails hot with the sauce spooned over the top.
