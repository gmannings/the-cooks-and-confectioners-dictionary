## Instructions:
1. Cut the cucumbers in half lengthwise and remove all the seeds. Cut them into small dice-shaped pieces.
2. In a bowl, combine the diced cucumbers, vinegar, salt, pepper, and sliced onions to make a marinade. Let it sit for at least 30 minutes.
3. Cut the lean ham or bacon into small dice-shaped pieces.
4. Clean and slice the mushrooms. If using truffles, clean and slice them as well.
5. Cut the veal sweetbreads, chicken livers, and chicken breasts into small dice-shaped pieces.
6. Squeeze the cucumbers to remove excess marinade.
7. In a saucepan, heat the melted bacon or lard. Add the diced cucumbers and saut√© them over medium heat until slightly softened.
8. Add a little gravy or broth to the saucepan and let it simmer gently.
9. In another saucepan, heat a little melted bacon and add the diced ham, chives, and parsley. Cook for a few minutes.
10. Add the minced sweetbreads, mushrooms, truffles, and artichoke bottoms (if using) to the saucepan. Toss them together and add some gravy, salt, pepper, and the faggot of sweet herbs. Let it simmer for a while and skim off any fat that rises to the surface.
11. Once the mixture in the saucepan is almost stewed enough, add the diced chicken livers and chicken breasts.
12. Add some essence of ham and cullis of veal and ham to bind the mixture together. Stir well.
13. When the cucumbers in the other saucepan are stewed enough, add some cullis of veal and ham to it.
14. Combine the ragout of cucumbers with the mixture in the saucepan. Stir everything together.
15. If serving with a roasted meat, make a hole in the meat by cutting out a large piece. Pour the salpicon into the hole.
16. Alternatively, you can serve the salpicon by itself as a standalone dish.

## Cooking time
The cooking time will vary depending on the type of meat used and the size of the diced ingredients. It is recommended to cook the meat until it is fully cooked and the vegetables are tender, which may take approximately 1-2 hours.
