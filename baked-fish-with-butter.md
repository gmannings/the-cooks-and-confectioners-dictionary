# Baked Fish with Butter

## Description
This recipe is for a baked fish dish with butter. The fish is scaled and cleaned, then baked in the oven. The butter is poured into a funnel and added to the fish before baking. The dish is then set aside to cool before serving.

## Ingredients:
- 1 whole fish (such as trout, salmon, or sea bass)
- Butter

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F).
2. Clean the fish by removing the scales, fins, gills, and tail. Rinse the fish under cold water and pat dry with paper towels.
3. Scale the fish by running the back of a knife against the grain of the scales, starting from the tail and moving towards the head. Repeat on both sides of the fish.
4. Using a sharp knife, make a small incision near the head of the fish to create a funnel-shaped opening.
5. Melt the butter in a saucepan over low heat until it is completely liquid.
6. Place the fish on a baking sheet or in a baking dish.
7. Use a funnel to pour the melted butter into the opening near the head of the fish. Allow the butter to flow into the cavity of the fish.
8. Once the fish is filled with butter, place it in the preheated oven.
9. Bake the fish for approximately 20-25 minutes, or until it is cooked through and flakes easily with a fork.
10. Remove the fish from the oven and let it cool for a few minutes.
11. Serve the baked fish with butter as a main dish or as part of a seafood platter.

## Cooking time
Approximately 20-25 minutes.
