# Goose Pie

## Description
A delicious and savory pie made with seasoned goose meat, encased in a buttery crust. The pie is then topped with melted butter and served with bay leaves, mustard, and sugar.

## Options and commentary
- You can use a whole goose or just the breast meat, depending on your preference.
- If you prefer a lighter crust, you can use puff pastry instead of a traditional pie crust.
- The addition of bay leaves, mustard, and sugar adds a unique flavor profile to the dish.

## Ingredients:
- 1 whole goose or goose breast
- Salt and pepper, to taste
- Butter, for greasing and topping the pie
- Pie crust or puff pastry
- Bay leaves, for serving
- Mustard, for serving
- Sugar, for serving

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F).
2. If using a whole goose, parboil it by placing it in a large pot of boiling water for about 10 minutes. Remove the goose from the pot and let it cool.
3. Once the goose is cool enough to handle, bone it by removing the bones from the meat. Cut the meat into bite-sized pieces.
4. Season the goose meat with salt and pepper, ensuring it is evenly coated.
5. Grease a deep pie dish with butter. Line the dish with the pie crust or puff pastry, ensuring it covers the bottom and sides of the dish.
6. Place the seasoned goose meat into the pie dish, spreading it out evenly.
7. Dot the top of the goose meat with small pieces of butter.
8. Cover the pie with another layer of pie crust or puff pastry, sealing the edges by crimping them together.
9. Make a small vent hole in the center of the pie crust to allow steam to escape during baking.
10. Place the pie in the preheated oven and bake for approximately 1 hour, or until the crust is golden brown and the goose meat is cooked through.
11. While the pie is baking, melt some butter in a small saucepan.
12. Once the pie is cooked, remove it from the oven and carefully pour the melted butter through the vent hole, filling the pie.
13. Serve the goose pie hot, garnished with bay leaves. Accompany with mustard and sugar on the side.
