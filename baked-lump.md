## Instructions:

8. Place the second piece of seasoned pork loin on top of the fruits.
9. Cover the pie with the remaining pie crust, sealing the edges well.
10. Make a small slit in the center of the pie crust to allow steam to escape.
11. Place the pie dish on a baking sheet to catch any drips.
12. Bake the pie in the preheated oven for approximately 1 hour, or until the crust is golden brown and the pork is cooked through.
13. While the pie is baking, melt some butter in a saucepan over low heat to make the butter sauce.
14. Once the pie is done, remove it from the oven and let it cool for a few minutes.
