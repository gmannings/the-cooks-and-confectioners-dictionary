## Ingredients:
- 1 calf's head
- 1 pint (500 ml) good gravy or strong broth
- 1/2 pint (250 ml) white wine
- 1/2 nutmeg, grated
- A pinch of mace
- 2 anchovies

- Forcemeat balls (made with veal or other ground meat)

## Instructions:
1. Place the calf's head in a large pot and cover it with water. Bring to a boil and simmer until the head is almost tender.
2. Remove the calf's head from the pot and let it cool slightly. Cut the head into thin slices.
3. In a separate pot, combine the gravy or broth, white wine, grated nutmeg, mace, anchovies, and onion stuck with cloves. Bring to a boil and let it simmer for 15 minutes.
4. Strain the broth mixture and return it to the pot. Bring it to a boil again.
5. Add the sliced calf's head, salt, and finely shredded lemon peel to the pot. If using sweetbreads, add them at this point as well.
6. Let the stew simmer for a few minutes to allow the flavors to meld together. 
7. In a separate bowl, mix the yolks of eggs with the brains (if using).
8. Heat a small amount of butter in a frying pan and fry the egg and brain mixture until cooked through. Set aside for garnish.
9. Just before serving, add a small amount of butter to the stew and stir it in.
10. Serve the calf's head stew hot, garnished with the fried brains and forcemeat balls.

## Cooking time
Approximately 2-3 hours, depending on the tenderness of the calf's head.
