# Pike in White Wine Sauce

## Description
This recipe is for cooking a pike fish in a flavorful white wine sauce. The pike is first cleaned and then boiled in a mixture of white wine, spices, and herbs. The sauce is made with Canary wine, crab or lobster, the cooking liquid from the pike, and drawn butter. The cooked pike is served on sippets (small pieces of toasted bread) dipped in the broth, and the sauce is poured over the fish.

## Ingredients:
- 1 whole pike (approximately 1 kg)
- Bay salt (for rubbing the pike)
- 1 liter white wine
- Salt, to taste
- Whole pepper, to taste
- Ginger, to taste
- Nutmeg, to taste
- Mace, to taste
- 4-5 cloves of garlic or 1 onion
- Ginger, a small piece
- A bunch of fresh herbs (such as parsley, thyme, and dill)
- 1/2 pint (250 ml) Canary wine
- 1 crab or part of a lobster, cooked and meat removed
- 2 spoonfuls of the cooking liquid from the pike
- 1 pound (450 g) drawn butter
- Sippets (small pieces of toasted bread)

## Instructions:
1. Rub the skin off the pike with bay salt while it is still alive.
2. Clean the pike well both inside and outside, and wash it clean.
3. In a large kettle, combine the white wine, salt, whole pepper, ginger, nutmeg, mace, cloves of garlic or onion, ginger, and fresh herbs.
4. Bring the mixture to a boil and let it boil until it reaches its height.

6. While the pike is cooking, prepare the sauce. In a separate saucepan, combine the Canary wine, crab or lobster meat, 2 spoonfuls of the cooking liquid from the pike, and drawn butter.
7. Place the saucepan over low heat and stir continuously until the sauce thickens.
8. Once the pike is cooked, remove it from the kettle and place it on a serving dish.
9. Dip the sippets in the broth from the kettle and arrange them around the pike on the serving dish.
10. Pour the thickened sauce over the pike and sippets.
