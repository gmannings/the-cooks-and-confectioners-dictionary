# Marrow Puddings

## Description
Marrow puddings are a traditional dish made with bread, milk, marrow, and various flavorings. They can be fried or baked and are often served as a garnish or side dish.

## Options and commentary
- Instead of French rolls, you can use any type of bread that you have on hand.
- If you can't find marrow, you can substitute it with butter or vegetable shortening.
- You can adjust the amount of sugar, salt, and flavorings to suit your taste preferences.
- Instead of frying the puddings, you can bake them in the oven for a healthier option.

## Ingredients:
- 2 French rolls (or any type of bread)
- 250g coarse biscuit (or breadcrumbs)
- 1 liter milk
- 500g marrow (or butter/vegetable shortening)
- 3 eggs
- Sugar, to taste
- Salt, to taste
- 1-2 tablespoons rose water
- Nutmeg, to taste
- 50g almonds, finely ground
- Guts (casings) for stuffing
- Butter, for frying or greasing

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F) if you choose to bake the puddings, or prepare a frying pan if you prefer to fry them.
2. Cut the French rolls into slices and place them in a saucepan.
3. In a separate saucepan, heat the milk over medium heat until it is lukewarm.
4. Pour the lukewarm milk over the bread slices, ensuring they are fully submerged. Cover the saucepan and let it soak until it cools down completely.
5. Once the bread mixture is cold, rub it through a colander to remove any lumps.
6. Mince the marrow and add it to the bread mixture.
7. In a bowl, beat and strain the eggs. Add them to the bread and marrow mixture.
8. Sweeten the mixture with sugar, add salt to taste, and stir in the rose water.
9. Grate in some nutmeg and add the ground almonds. Mix all the ingredients together until well combined.
10. Stuff the mixture into guts (casings), making sure not to overfill them.
11. If frying, heat a frying pan over medium heat and melt a little butter. Fry the puddings until they turn golden brown on all sides. Alternatively, if baking, place the puddings in the preheated oven and bake for about 20-25 minutes or until they are golden brown.
12. Once cooked, remove the puddings from the pan or oven and let them cool on a wire rack.
13. Serve the marrow puddings as a garnish for boiled pudding or fricassee of chickens for the first course. Alternatively, you can serve them in individual dishes or plates as a side dish for the second course.
