# Braised Pheasants in Champagne Sauce

## Description
This recipe is for braised pheasants cooked in a rich champagne sauce. The pheasants are first seared and then simmered in a mixture of veal gravy, champagne, mushrooms, and truffles. The resulting sauce is strained and thickened, then poured over the pheasants before serving. This dish is elegant and perfect for a special occasion.

## Ingredients:
- 2 pheasants
- 1 onion, sliced
- 100g gammon bacon, sliced
- 2 sprigs of parsley
- 1 faggot of sweet herbs (a bundle of herbs such as thyme, rosemary, and bay leaves)
- 1 carp, gutted and washed
- 250ml veal gravy
- 1 bottle of champagne (750ml)
- 100g mushrooms, chopped
- 50g truffles, chopped
- 1 clove of garlic
- Salt, to taste
- Partridge Cullis (optional, for thickening)
- Partridge Pains (optional, for garnish)

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 180Â°C.
2. In a large stewpan, lay the veal steaks at the bottom.
3. Add the sliced onion, gammon bacon, parsley roots, and the faggot of sweet herbs.
4. Cut the carp into pieces, similar to how you would for stewing, and add it to the stewpan.
5. Place the stewpan over medium heat and sear the ingredients until they are browned, as if you were making gravy.
6. Pour in the veal gravy and the champagne.
7. Add the chopped mushrooms, truffles, and the clove of garlic.
8. Season with salt to taste, but be careful not to make it too salty.
9. Allow the mixture to boil together for a while, ensuring that the flavors meld.
10. Once the ingredients are cooked, strain the mixture through a sieve, pressing it through to create a thick sauce.
11. If the sauce is not thick enough, add some partridge cullis to thicken it further.
12. Transfer the sauce to a clean stewpan.
13. Tie up the pheasants and place them in the sauce to keep them hot until serving.
14. When ready to serve, remove the bindings from the pheasants and arrange them on a serving dish.
15. Pour the sauce over the pheasants.
16. Optionally, garnish the dish with partridge pains.
17. Serve the braised pheasants in champagne sauce immediately.
