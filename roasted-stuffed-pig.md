# Roasted Stuffed Pig

## Description
This recipe is for roasting a whole pig with the skin off. The pig is stuffed with a mixture of cream, eggs, bread, spices, and herbs, then roasted over an open fire. The pig is basted with a mixture of claret wine, salt, vinegar, nutmeg, and thyme while roasting. Once cooked, the pig is frothed up with butter and served with a sauce made from the drippings, butter, and minced lemon.

## Options and commentary
- Instead of roasting the pig over an open fire, you can use a modern oven set to a high temperature.
- Adjust the seasoning and spices according to your taste preferences.
- Serve the roasted pig with your choice of side dishes, such as roasted vegetables or mashed potatoes.

## Ingredients:
- 1 whole pig, approximately 15-20 kg (or smaller if desired)
- 500 ml cream
- 6 egg yolks
- 200 g grated bread
- Salt, to taste
- 200 g beef suet
- 1 tsp cloves
- 1 tsp beaten mace
- 2 tbsp thyme, shredded
- Sprigs of thyme, for garnish
- 500 ml claret wine
- 2 tbsp salt
- 2 tbsp vinegar
- 1 whole nutmeg, grated
- 2 tbsp thyme
- 100 g butter
- 1 lemon, minced

## Instructions:
1. Preheat your oven to 220°C (425°F) or prepare an open fire for roasting.
2. Clean the pig by removing any internal organs and excess fat. Rinse the pig thoroughly and pat it dry with a clean cloth.
3. In a large bowl, combine the cream, egg yolks, grated bread, salt, beef suet, cloves, beaten mace, and shredded thyme. Mix well until you have a stiff pudding-like mixture.
4. Stuff the belly of the pig with the prepared stuffing mixture. Sew up the opening to secure the stuffing inside.
5. If using an oven, place the pig on a roasting rack in a large roasting pan. If using an open fire, secure the pig on a spit.
6. Insert sprigs of thyme all over the pig's skin.
7. In a separate dish, mix together the claret wine, salt, vinegar, grated nutmeg, and thyme. Place this dish under the pig to catch the drippings.
8. Place the pig in the preheated oven or over the open fire. If using an oven, roast the pig for approximately 20 minutes per kilogram, or until the internal temperature reaches 70°C (160°F). If using an open fire, rotate the spit regularly to ensure even cooking.
9. While the pig is roasting, baste it with the claret wine mixture every 30 minutes.
10. Once the pig is cooked, remove it from the oven or fire and let it rest for 10-15 minutes.
11. In a small saucepan, melt the butter. Add the drippings from the roasting pan or the dish under the pig, along with the minced lemon. Cook over low heat until the sauce thickens.
12. Carve the roasted pig and serve it with the sauce.

## Cooking time
Approximately 20 minutes per kilogram, or until the internal temperature reaches 70°C (160°F).
