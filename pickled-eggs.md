# Pickled Eggs

## Description
Pickled eggs are a tangy and flavorful snack that can be enjoyed on their own or added to salads and sandwiches. This recipe from the 18th century involves boiling the eggs in a mixture of vinegar, white wine, and salt, and serving them with some of the pickling liquid.

## Options and commentary
- You can adjust the amount of vinegar and white wine to suit your taste preferences. More vinegar will result in a tangier flavor, while more white wine will add a milder taste.
- Feel free to experiment with adding herbs and spices to the pickling liquid, such as dill, garlic, or peppercorns, to enhance the flavor of the eggs.

## Ingredients:
- 6 eggs
- 1 cup vinegar
- 1 cup white wine
- 1 teaspoon salt

## Instructions:
1. Place the eggs in a saucepan and cover them with cold water.
2. Bring the water to a boil over high heat.
3. Once the water is boiling, reduce the heat to medium and let the eggs simmer for 8-10 minutes.
4. While the eggs are boiling, prepare an ice bath by filling a large bowl with cold water and ice cubes.
5. After the eggs have finished boiling, carefully transfer them to the ice bath using a slotted spoon.
6. Let the eggs sit in the ice bath for about 5 minutes to cool and stop the cooking process.
7. Once the eggs are cool, gently tap them on a hard surface to crack the shells.
8. Place the cracked eggs back into the saucepan.
9. In a separate saucepan, combine the vinegar, white wine, and salt. Bring the mixture to a boil over medium heat.
10. Pour the boiling vinegar mixture over the cracked eggs in the saucepan.
11. Cover the saucepan and let the eggs marinate in the pickling liquid for at least 24 hours in the refrigerator.
