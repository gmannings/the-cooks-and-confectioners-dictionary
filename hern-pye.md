# Hern Pye

## Description
Hern Pye is a traditional 18th-century dish made with a whole fowl, flavored with onions, herbs, and spices, and baked in a pastry crust. The dish is then served with melted butter poured over it.

## Ingredients:
- 1 whole chicken or fowl
- Salt
- Water
- 1 onion, finely chopped
- Fresh herbs (such as parsley, thyme, and rosemary), finely chopped
- Butter
- Pepper
- Mace
- Nutmeg
- Bacon, cut into small pieces
- Juice of 1 lemon
- Pastry crust (store-bought or homemade)
- Melted butter for serving

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F).
2. Break the breastbone of the fowl by pressing down firmly with a heavy knife or cleaver.
3. In a large bowl, mix warm water and salt. Soak the fowl in this mixture for about an hour to help tenderize the meat.
4. In a separate bowl, combine the chopped onion and herbs.
5. Take a small amount of butter and shape it into little balls. Mix these butter balls with the onion and herb mixture.
6. Stuff some of the butter and herb balls into the belly of the fowl.
7. Season the fowl with salt, pepper, mace, and nutmeg. Sprinkle these spices evenly over the fowl.
8. Lard the breast of the fowl by inserting small strips of bacon into the meat.
9. Place some of the remaining butter and herb balls around the fowl.
10. Sprinkle the juice of one lemon over the fowl.
11. Roll out the pastry crust and line a baking dish with it.
12. Place the fowl in the pastry-lined dish and cover it with the remaining pastry crust. Make sure to seal the edges well.
13. Bake the Hern Pye in the preheated oven for about 1.5 to 2 hours, or until the pastry is golden brown and the fowl is cooked through.
14. Once the Hern Pye is baked, remove it from the oven and let it cool slightly.
15. Pour melted butter over the Hern Pye and allow it to stand until it is cold.
16. Serve the Hern Pye as a main dish, slicing it into portions and spooning the melted butter over each serving.
