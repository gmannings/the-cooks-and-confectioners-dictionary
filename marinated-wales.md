# Marinated Wales

## Description
Marinated Wales is a traditional dish from the 18th century. It consists of wales (a type of fish) marinated in a flavorful mixture of vinegar, water, herbs, and spices. The wales are first fried in oil and then soaked in the marinade until they are tender and infused with the flavors.

## Ingredients:
- 2 liters of vinegar
- 500 ml of water
- a handful of bay leaves
- 225 grams of rosemary
- 50 grams of black pepper, crushed
- Salt, to taste
- Sallet-oil (a type of vegetable oil)
- Wales (substitute with any firm white fish, such as cod or haddock)

## Instructions:
1. In a large pot, combine the vinegar, water, bay leaves, rosemary, crushed black pepper, and salt. Bring the mixture to a gentle boil and let it simmer for about 10 minutes to infuse the flavors.
2. While the marinade is simmering, heat some sallet-oil in a frying pan over medium heat.
3. Fry the wales (or substitute fish) in the hot oil until they are golden brown and cooked through. Remove them from the pan and set aside.
4. In an earthen pan or any other suitable container, layer the fried wales with the bay leaves.
5. Pour the cooled marinade over the wales, making sure they are completely submerged.
6. Cover the pan tightly and refrigerate for at least 24 hours to allow the flavors to develop and the wales to marinate.
7. Serve the marinated wales chilled as an appetizer or as part of a seafood platter.
