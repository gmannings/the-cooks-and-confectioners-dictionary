# Dzel'd Lamb's Head Potage

## Description
This recipe is for a traditional lamb's head potage, a hearty and flavorful soup made with the head, feet, and liver of a lamb, along with bacon. The potage is boiled together in broth until well-seasoned, then soaked in more broth and gravy. The lamb's head is breaded and fried before being placed back into the potage. The dish is garnished with the feet, bacon, and livers. The potage is thickened with a white cullis made from soaked crumb bread, sweet almonds, and hard-boiled egg yolks. It is then seasoned with lemon juice and served hot.

## Options and commentary
- If you prefer a milder flavor, you can omit the liver from the recipe.
- You can use smoked bacon for a smoky flavor or regular bacon for a milder taste.
- The potage can be garnished with additional herbs such as parsley or chives for added freshness.
- Serve the potage with crusty bread or a side salad for a complete meal.

## Ingredients:
- 1 lamb's head
- 2 lamb's feet
- 200g young bacon

- 100g bread crumbs
- 50g sweet almonds

## Instructions:
1. In a large pot, bring water to a boil and blanch the lamb's head, feet, and liver for 5 minutes. Drain and set aside.
