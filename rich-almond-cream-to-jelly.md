# Rich Almond Cream to Jelly

## Description
This recipe is for a rich and creamy almond jelly dessert. It is a sweet and indulgent treat that can be enjoyed on its own or served with fresh fruits or whipped cream.

## Ingredients:
- 1 pound of hartshorn (substitute with gelatin or agar-agar for a vegetarian option)
- 2 quarts and 1 pint of water
- 12 ounces of blanched almonds
- 2 tablespoons of orange water
- 15 tablespoons of cream
- Sugar, to taste

## Instructions:
1. In a large pot, combine the hartshorn and water. Bring to a boil and simmer until the liquid has reduced to about half the original quantity.
2. Strain the liquid through a jelly bag or fine-mesh sieve to remove any solids.
3. In a separate bowl, finely grind the blanched almonds using a food processor or mortar and pestle.
4. Add the orange water and cream to the ground almonds and mix well.
5. Pour the strained liquid into a skillet and add the almond mixture. Stir to combine.
6. Sweeten the mixture to taste with sugar.
7. Place the skillet on the stove and cook over low heat, stirring constantly, until the mixture is about to boil.
8. Remove the skillet from the heat and continue stirring until the mixture is almost cold.
9. Pour the mixture into narrow-bottomed drinking glasses or dessert molds.
10. Allow the jelly to set in the glasses for 24 hours.
11. When ready to serve, dip the glasses in warm water for a minute to loosen the jelly.
12. Carefully turn the glasses upside down to release the jelly onto serving plates.
13. Serve the almond cream jelly chilled and enjoy!
