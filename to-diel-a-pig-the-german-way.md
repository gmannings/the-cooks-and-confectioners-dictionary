# To Diel a Pig the German Way

## Description
This recipe is a traditional German method of cooking pork. The pork is first cut into quarters and then cooked in a stew-pan with melted bacon or fried with lard. It is then simmered in a flavorful broth with white wine, seasoned with salt, pepper, and nutmeg, and infused with the aroma of sweet herbs and cloves-studded onion. Finally, the dish is garnished with fried parsley and the pig's brains.

## Options and commentary
- Instead of using pork loin, you can use pork shoulder or pork chops.
- If you prefer a lighter version, you can use olive oil instead of bacon or lard.
- You can add other vegetables like carrots and celery to the broth for added flavor.
- If you don't have oysters, you can omit them or substitute with mushrooms.
- The brains of the pig are optional and can be omitted if desired.

## Ingredients:
- 1 pork loin (or pork shoulder or pork chops)
- 100g bacon (or lard or olive oil)
- 500ml broth (chicken or vegetable)
- 100ml white wine
- Salt and pepper to taste
- 1/2 teaspoon nutmeg
- 1 bunch of fresh herbs (such as thyme, rosemary, and parsley)
- 1 onion
- 4 cloves
- 100g oysters (or mushrooms)
- 1 tablespoon flour
- 1 lemon
- Fresh parsley for garnish

## Instructions:
1. Cut the pork loin into four quarters.
2. In a large stew-pan, melt the bacon over medium heat. If using lard or olive oil, heat it in the stew-pan.
3. Add the pork quarters to the stew-pan and cook them until browned on all sides. If necessary, do this in batches to avoid overcrowding the pan.
4. Pour in the broth and white wine, and season with salt, pepper, and nutmeg.
5. Tie the fresh herbs together with kitchen twine to create a bouquet garni and add it to the stew-pan.
6. Peel the onion and stick the cloves into it. Place the onion in the stew-pan.
7. Bring the liquid to a simmer, then reduce the heat to low. Cover the stew-pan and let the pork simmer for about 1.5 to 2 hours, or until the meat is tender.
8. While the pork is simmering, prepare the oysters (or mushrooms) by tossing them in a separate stew-pan with some lard or olive oil. If using mushrooms, slice them before cooking.
9. Sprinkle the flour over the oysters (or mushrooms) and squeeze the juice of the lemon over them. Cook for a few minutes until the flour is cooked and the oysters (or mushrooms) are heated through.
10. Once the pork is tender, remove the bouquet garni and the onion from the stew-pan.
11. Serve the pork quarters on a platter, garnished with the fried parsley and the oysters (or mushrooms).
12. Optionally, if desired, serve the pig's brains alongside the pork quarters.

## Cooking time
Approximately 1.5 to 2 hours.
