# Farced Eels

## Description
This recipe is for farced eels, which are eels that have been deboned and filled with a flavorful mixture before being baked. The filling is made with eel flesh, cream, breadcrumbs, mushrooms, truffles, chives, and parsley. The eels are then coated with breadcrumbs and baked until they are golden brown.

## Ingredients:
- 2 eels
- 100g eel flesh (alternatively, use another type of white fish)
- 50ml cream
- 50g breadcrumbs
- 50g mushrooms, finely chopped
- 25g truffles, finely chopped (optional)
- 1 tablespoon chives, finely chopped
- 1 tablespoon parsley, finely chopped
- Salt and pepper to taste

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F).
2. Debone the eels by carefully removing the bones while keeping the eel intact. Set aside.
3. In a mortar, pound the eel flesh until it becomes a smooth paste.
4. In a bowl, mix the eel flesh with the cream, breadcrumbs, mushrooms, truffles (if using), chives, parsley, salt, and pepper. Stir until well combined.
5. Spread the farce (filling) onto the bones of the eels, making sure to cover them completely.
6. Coat the eels with the breadcrumbs, pressing them gently to adhere.
7. Place the eels in a tart pan or baking dish.
8. Bake in the preheated oven for about 30-40 minutes, or until the eels are golden brown and cooked through.
9. Remove from the oven and let the eels rest for a few minutes before serving.
