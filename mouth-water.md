# Mouth Water

## Description
This recipe is for a mouth water that was believed to be beneficial for treating scurvy and improving gum health. It is made by boiling a combination of ingredients including allum, black thorn bark, red rose leaves, scurvy-grass, Seville orange peel, and myrrh. Holding a mouthful of this water in the mouth for a period of time, once or twice a day, is said to help with scurvy, promote gum growth, and tighten loose teeth.

## Ingredients:
- 1 bit of allum
- 6 ounces of black thorn bark, sliced
- A handful of red rose leaves
- 1 quart of water
- 1 quart of claret (red wine)
- 2 handfuls of scurvy-grass
- Peel of 2 Seville oranges
- Powdered myrrh (amount equivalent to the size of a shilling coin, twice)

## Instructions:
1. In a large pot, combine the allum, black thorn bark, red rose leaves, water, and claret.
2. Bring the mixture to a boil and let it simmer until it is reduced by one-third.
3. Add the scurvy-grass, Seville orange peel, and powdered myrrh to the pot.
4. Stir the ingredients well and continue to boil the mixture.
5. Once the mixture boils up, strain it to remove any solids.
6. Allow the mouth water to cool before using.
7. Take a mouthful of the water and hold it in your mouth for as long as you can, once or twice a day.
