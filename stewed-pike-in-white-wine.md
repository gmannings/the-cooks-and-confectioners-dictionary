# Stewed Pike in White Wine

## Description
This recipe is for a classic 18th-century dish called "Stewed Pike the City Fashion." It involves cooking a pike fish in white wine and then serving it with a flavorful sauce made from the cooking broth, eggs, butter, cream, and sugar. The dish is garnished with currants, prunes, mace, cinnamon, barberries, lemon slices, and a sprinkle of sugar.

## Options and commentary
- You can use any type of white fish instead of pike, such as cod or haddock.
- If you don't have barberries, you can substitute with cranberries or red currants.
- Adjust the amount of sugar according to your taste preference.

## Ingredients:
- 1 pike fish (or any white fish), cleaned and gutted
- 500 ml white wine
- Salt, to taste
- 1 cinnamon stick
- 2-3 whole mace blades
- 50 g currants, boiled
- 50 g prunes, boiled
- 3-4 egg yolks
- 50 g butter
- 100 ml cream
- 2 tbsp sugar
- Mace, for garnish
- Cinnamon, for garnish
- Barberries, for garnish
- Lemon slices, for garnish
- Sugar, for sprinkling

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F).
2. In a large oven-safe dish, pour in the white wine until it just covers the fish.
3. Place the dish over medium heat and bring the wine to a boil.
4. Add the cleaned pike fish to the boiling wine and skim off any foam that rises to the surface.
5. Season with salt, cinnamon stick, and mace blades.
6. Reduce the heat to low and simmer the fish in the wine for about 15-20 minutes, or until cooked through. The flesh should be opaque and easily flake with a fork.
7. Remove the fish from the cooking liquid and transfer it to a serving dish.
8. Arrange the boiled currants and prunes over the fish.
9. In a separate bowl, whisk together the egg yolks, butter, cream, and sugar until well combined.
10. Gradually pour the egg mixture into the cooking liquid, stirring constantly to prevent curdling.
11. Place the cooking liquid back on the stove over low heat and cook, stirring continuously, until the sauce thickens slightly.
12. Pour the sauce over the fish and garnish with mace, cinnamon, barberries, lemon slices, and a sprinkle of sugar.
13. Place the dish in the preheated oven for 5-10 minutes, just until the sauce is heated through.
14. Serve the stewed pike hot, accompanied by boiled potatoes or steamed vegetables.
