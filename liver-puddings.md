# Liver Puddings

## Description
Liver puddings are a traditional dish made with boiled hog's liver, grated bread, beef suet, spices, currants, milk, eggs, and orange water. The mixture is stuffed into hog intestines and boiled until cooked through.

## Options and commentary
- Instead of using hog intestines, you can use sausage casings or shape the mixture into patties and pan-fry them.
- You can adjust the spices and seasoning according to your taste preferences.
- Ambergreeſe is a rare and expensive ingredient, so it can be omitted if not available.

## Ingredients:
- 1 hog's liver
- Grated bread (equal quantity to grated liver)
- 2 pounds of beef suet, finely shredded and sifted
- 1 ounce of mixed spice (cloves, mace, nutmeg, and cinnamon)
- 1 pound of currants
- 2 grains of ambergreeſe (optional)
- 3 pints of new milk
- 6 eggs
- Orange water
- Salt

## Instructions:
1. Boil the hog's liver until cooked through. 
2. Dry the liver in an oven and grate it.
3. In a large bowl, combine the grated liver, grated bread, shredded beef suet, mixed spice, currants, and ambergreeſe (if using). Mix well.
4. Pour the new milk over the mixture and let it stand covered for a while.
5. In a separate bowl, beat the eggs with a few spoonfuls of orange water and a little salt.
6. Add the beaten eggs to the liver mixture and mix until well combined.
7. If using hog intestines, rinse them thoroughly and tie one end securely. Fill the intestines with the liver mixture, leaving some space for expansion. Tie the other end securely.
8. If using sausage casings, follow the instructions on the packaging for filling and tying.
9. If shaping into patties, take a portion of the liver mixture and shape it into a patty shape.
10. Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Carefully place the filled intestines, sausage casings, or patties into the boiling water.
11. Boil the liver puddings for about 1 hour or until cooked through. If using sausage casings or patties, adjust the cooking time accordingly.
12. Once cooked, remove the liver puddings from the water and let them cool slightly before serving.

## Cooking time
Approximately 1 hour (may vary depending on the size and thickness of the liver puddings)
