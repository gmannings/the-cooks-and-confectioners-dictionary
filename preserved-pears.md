# Preserved Pears

## Description
This recipe is for preserving pears in a sweet syrup. The pears are layered in an earthen pan with vine leaves and then cooked with sugar and water until they become soft. The preserved pears can be stored for later use.

## Ingredients:
- Pears (not too ripe)
- Vine leaves
- Sugar
- Water

## Instructions:
1. Select pears that are not too ripe. Wash and peel the pears, removing the cores and seeds.
2. Take an earthen pan and place a layer of vine leaves at the bottom.
3. Arrange a layer of pears on top of the vine leaves.
4. Continue layering the pears and vine leaves until the pan is full.
5. In a separate pot, combine half a pound of sugar for every pound of pears.
6. Add enough water to the pot to dissolve the sugar.
7. Place the pot over a gentle fire and bring the sugar-water mixture to a boil.
8. Once the mixture is boiling, carefully pour it over the layered pears in the earthen pan.
9. Place the pan over a gentle fire and let the pears cook until they become soft. This may take some time, so be patient.
10. Once the pears are soft, remove the pan from the fire and let it cool.
11. Once cooled, transfer the preserved pears and the syrup into clean, sterilized jars.
12. Seal the jars tightly and store them in a cool, dark place for future use.

## Cooking time
Approximately 1-2 hours, depending on the ripeness of the pears and the heat of the fire.
