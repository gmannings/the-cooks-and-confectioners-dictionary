# Fried Fish with Parsley

## Description
This recipe is for a simple and delicious dish of fried fish served with crispy parsley. The fish is boiled first to remove any slime, then coated in flour and salt before being fried until golden brown. It is a classic dish that can be enjoyed as a main course or as part of a seafood platter.

## Ingredients:
- 500g white fish fillets (such as cod or haddock)
- Flour, for dredging
- Salt, to taste
- Vegetable oil, for frying
- Fresh parsley, for garnish

## Instructions:
1. Fill a large pot with water and bring it to a boil.
2. Carefully place the fish fillets into the boiling water and stir them gently. Cook the fish for about 5 minutes or until it is cooked through and flakes easily with a fork.
3. Remove the fish from the water and place it on a clean kitchen towel or paper towels. Pat the fish dry to remove any excess moisture.
4. Using a sharp knife, make a slit down the back of each fish fillet, creating a pocket.
5. In a shallow dish, combine flour and salt. Dredge each fish fillet in the flour mixture, making sure to coat both sides evenly.
6. Heat vegetable oil in a frying pan over medium-high heat. The oil should be hot enough to sizzle when the fish is added.
7. Carefully place the coated fish fillets into the hot oil. Fry them for about 2-3 minutes on each side or until they are golden brown and crispy.
8. Once the fish is cooked, remove it from the pan and place it on a paper towel-lined plate to drain any excess oil.
9. In the same pan, add a handful of fresh parsley leaves and fry them for about 30 seconds or until they are crispy.
10. Serve the fried fish hot, garnished with the crispy parsley.
