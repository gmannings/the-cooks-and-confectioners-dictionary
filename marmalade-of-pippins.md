# Marmalade of Pippins

## Description
This recipe is for making a marmalade using Pippin apples. The apples are peeled and cored, then boiled in water until they are tender. A test is done to check if the marmalade has reached the desired consistency. Lemon peel is added for flavor. The yellow rinds of oranges are boiled to remove bitterness, then cut into strips and mashed into a pulp. The orange pulp is added to the marmalade mixture, which is then placed in pots and sprinkled with sugar.

## Ingredients:
- Pippin apples
- Spring water
- Lemon peel
- Yellow rinds of oranges
- Sugar

## Instructions:
1. Peel and core the Pippin apples.
2. Place the apples in a preserving pan and add enough spring water to just cover them.
3. Boil the apples over a high heat.
4. Take out a small amount of the boiled apples and place them on a plate. Allow them to cool.
5. Check the cooled apples for jelly-like consistency. If they are jellied, the marmalade is ready. If not, continue boiling the apples and repeat the test until the desired consistency is reached.
6. Remove the apples from the heat.
7. Add a little lemon peel to the apples.
8. Boil the yellow rinds of oranges in two or three waters to remove bitterness.
9. Cut the boiled orange rinds into narrow strips.
10. Mash the orange rinds into a pulp.
11. Allow both the apple mixture and orange pulp to cool.
12. Mix the orange pulp into the apple mixture.
13. Transfer the marmalade into pots.
14. Sprinkle sugar over the marmalade.

## Cooking time
Approximately 1-2 hours, depending on the desired consistency of the marmalade.
