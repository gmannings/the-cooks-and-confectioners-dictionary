# Salted Ham

## Description
This recipe is for making salted ham, a preserved meat that can be used in a variety of dishes. The ham is soaked in a brine solution for several weeks to cure it, and then hung to dry for additional flavor and preservation.

## Ingredients:
- 1/2 peck (approximately 5.6 kilograms) of bay salt
- 75 grams of brown sugar
- 50 grams of salt peter (potassium nitrate)
- Water
- 1 ham (size of ham can vary based on personal preference)

## Instructions:
1. In a large container, combine the bay salt, brown sugar, and salt peter.
2. Add enough water to the mixture to create a brine solution that is strong enough to float an egg.
3. Place the ham into the brine, ensuring that the liquid covers the ham by at least an inch.
4. Allow the ham to soak in the brine for three weeks, refrigerating if necessary to maintain a cool temperature.
5. After three weeks, remove the ham from the brine and pat it dry with a cloth.
6. Hang the ham in a well-ventilated area, such as a chimney, for ten days to allow it to dry and develop flavor.
7. Once the ham is dry, it is ready to be used in various dishes.
