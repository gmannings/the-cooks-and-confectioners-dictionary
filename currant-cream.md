## Description

## Options and commentary

- Adjust the amount of sugar according to your taste preference.
- You can serve the currant cream as is or use it as a topping for other desserts like cakes or pies.

## Ingredients:
- 250g fresh currants
- 500ml cream
- 50g sugar
- 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon

## Instructions:
1. Rinse the fresh currants under cold water to remove any dirt or debris. 
2. In a saucepan, add the cream and bring it to a boil over medium heat.
3. Once the cream is boiling, add the fresh currants to the saucepan. Use a spoon or a potato masher to gently bruise the currants, releasing their juices into the cream.
4. Continue to cook the cream and currant mixture for about 5 minutes, stirring occasionally.
5. Place a fine-mesh strainer over a bowl and carefully pour the cream mixture through the strainer to remove any solids or seeds from the currants. Use the back of a spoon to press down on the currants and extract as much liquid as possible.
6. Return the strained cream to the saucepan and place it back on the stove over low heat.
7. Add the sugar and ground cinnamon to the cream and stir until the sugar has dissolved completely.
8. Cook the cream mixture for an additional 5 minutes, stirring occasionally, to allow the flavors to meld together.
9. Remove the saucepan from the heat and let the currant cream cool to room temperature.
10. Once cooled, transfer the currant cream to a serving dish or individual serving bowls.
11. Cover the dish or bowls with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 2 hours, or until the cream has set and is chilled.
12. Serve the currant cream chilled, either on its own or as a topping for other desserts.
