# Boiled Quails

## Description
This recipe is for boiled quails, a dish that was popular in the 18th century. The quails are prepared by removing their heads and legs, trussing them, and then boiling them in a flavorful broth. The dish is served on sippets (small pieces of toasted bread) and garnished with slices of orange or lemon. The broth is thickened with grated manchet (fine white bread crumbs) and butter, and flavored with sugar, rose-water, and lemon.

## Ingredients:
- 4 quails
- 4 cups good strong broth
- 1/2 cup white wine
- Salt
- Pepper
- 1/2 teaspoon whole mace
- 1/4 cup currants
- 1 cup grated manchet (fine white bread crumbs)
- 2 tablespoons butter
- 1 tablespoon sugar
- 1 tablespoon rose-water
- 1 lemon, sliced
- 1 orange, sliced

## Instructions:
1. Remove the heads and legs from the quails.
2. Truss the quails by tying the legs together with kitchen twine.
3. In a large pot or pipkin, combine the broth, white wine, salt, pepper, whole mace, and currants.
4. Bring the broth to a boil over medium heat.
5. Add the quails to the pot and reduce the heat to low.
6. Simmer the quails in the broth for about 20 minutes, or until they are cooked through.
7. While the quails are cooking, prepare the sippets by toasting small pieces of bread until they are crisp.
8. Remove the cooked quails from the pot and place them on a serving dish lined with the sippets.
9. In a separate saucepan, melt the butter over medium heat.
10. Add the grated manchet to the melted butter and stir until it is well combined.
11. Gradually add the thickened broth from the pot to the saucepan, stirring constantly.
12. Stir in the sugar, rose-water, and the juice of half a lemon.
13. Continue to cook the broth mixture until it thickens to a gravy-like consistency.
14. Pour the thickened broth over the quails and sippets on the serving dish.
15. Garnish the dish with slices of orange and lemon.
16. Serve the boiled quails hot.
