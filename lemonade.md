# Lemonade

## Description
Lemonade is a refreshing and tangy citrus drink that is perfect for hot summer days. This recipe combines the zesty flavor of lemon peel with the sweetness of sugar to create a delicious and thirst-quenching beverage.

## Ingredients:
- Lemon peel
- Water
- Sugar
- Oil of Sulphur (optional)
- Lemon slices

## Instructions:
1. In a large pot, add water and bring it to a boil.
2. While the water is boiling, use a vegetable peeler to carefully scrape the peel off the lemons. Make sure to only scrape the outer yellow part of the peel, avoiding the white pith which can be bitter.
3. Once the water has come to a boil, remove it from the heat and add the lemon peel to the pot.
4. Stir in the sugar, using a ratio of 1 pound of sugar for every quart of water. Adjust the amount of sugar according to your taste preferences.
5. If desired, add a few drops of oil of sulphur to the pot. This ingredient is optional and can be omitted if you prefer a more natural lemonade.
6. Return the pot to the heat and simmer the mixture for about 10 minutes, stirring occasionally to dissolve the sugar.
7. After 10 minutes, remove the pot from the heat and let the lemonade cool to room temperature.
8. Once the lemonade has cooled, strain out the lemon peel using a fine-mesh sieve or cheesecloth.
9. Squeeze the juice from the lemons and add it to the strained lemonade.
10. Stir well to combine all the ingredients.
11. Refrigerate the lemonade for at least 1 hour to chill it before serving.
12. Before serving, garnish the lemonade with slices of lemon for an extra burst of citrus flavor.
