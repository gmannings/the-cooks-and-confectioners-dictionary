# Farced Tenches

## Description
Farced Tenches is a dish made with tench fish that has been stuffed with a mixture of minced fish, mushrooms, herbs, and spices. The stuffed fish is then fried until brown and simmered in a flavorful sauce. It can be served with a ragout of various ingredients such as milts, oysters, crayfish, mushrooms, or truffles.

## Options and commentary
- Instead of tench, you can use any firm white fish such as cod, haddock, or sea bass.
- If you don't have access to fresh mushrooms, you can use dried mushrooms that have been rehydrated.
- The cooking time may vary depending on the thickness of the fish fillets.

## Ingredients:
- 4 tench fish fillets (or any firm white fish fillets)
- 1 carp fillet (or any other fish fillet)
- 100g mushrooms, finely chopped
- 2 tablespoons chives, finely chopped
- 2 tablespoons parsley, finely chopped
- Salt and pepper to taste
- 1 teaspoon mixed spices (such as paprika, nutmeg, and cinnamon)
- 2 slices of bread, crusts removed
- 2 eggs
- 100ml cream
- 50g butter
- 2 tablespoons flour
- 100ml white wine
- 200ml fish broth
- 1 onion, studded with cloves
- 1 bouquet garni (a bundle of herbs tied together with kitchen twine)
- Ragout ingredients of your choice (such as milts, oysters, crayfish, mushrooms, or truffles)

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F).

2. Slime the tench fish by rinsing them under cold water and patting them dry with paper towels.

3. Make a shallow cut along the back of each tench fillet using a sharp knife. Lift the skin from the bone by inserting the knife under the skin and gently raising it.

4. Cut the skin crossways at the head and tail of each fillet. Strip off the skin and remove the bone.

5. In a bowl, combine the minced carp fillet, mushrooms, chives, parsley, salt, pepper, mixed spices, and minced herbs. Mix well.

6. In a mortar and pestle, pound the bread slices into breadcrumbs.

7. In a separate bowl, soak the breadcrumbs in cream for a few minutes until softened.

8. Add the raw egg yolks and butter to the breadcrumb mixture. Mix well.

9. Add the minced fish mixture to the breadcrumb mixture. Mix until well combined.

10. Stuff each tench fillet with the farce mixture, pressing it firmly into the cavity.

11. Heat a frying pan over medium heat and add clarified butter. Once hot, fry the stuffed tench fillets one by one until browned on both sides. Remove from the pan and set aside.

12. In a saucepan, melt a piece of butter over medium heat. Add flour and stir continuously until the mixture turns brown.

13. Pour in the hot white wine and fish broth, stirring constantly to prevent lumps from forming.

14. Add the fried tench fillets, salt, pepper, onion studded with cloves, and bouquet garni to the saucepan. Simmer over a gentle heat for about 20 minutes, or until the fish is cooked through.

15. Remove the tench fillets from the saucepan and transfer them to a serving dish.

16. Prepare a ragout of your choice (such as milts, oysters, crayfish, mushrooms, or truffles) and pour it over the cooked tench fillets.

17. Serve the farced tenches hot.
