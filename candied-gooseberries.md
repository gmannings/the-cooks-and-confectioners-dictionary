# Candied Gooseberries

## Description
Candied gooseberries are a sweet and tangy treat made by coating fresh gooseberries in a sugar syrup and allowing them to harden. This recipe adds a hint of rose flavor with the addition of rose water.

## Ingredients:
- 1 kg fresh gooseberries
- 2 kg sugar
- 28 g sugar candy
- 60 ml rose water

## Instructions:
1. Wash the gooseberries and pat them dry with a clean cloth.
2. In a large pot, dissolve the sugar and sugar candy in the rose water over medium heat. Stir until the sugar has completely dissolved.
3. Increase the heat to high and bring the syrup to a boil. Cook until the syrup reaches the candy stage, which is around 120Â°C on a candy thermometer. This should take about 15-20 minutes.
4. Remove the pot from the heat and let the syrup cool for a few minutes.
5. Add the gooseberries to the syrup and stir gently with a wooden spatula until they are fully coated.
6. Allow the gooseberries to cool completely in the syrup. As they cool, the syrup will harden and create a candy coating on the gooseberries.
7. Once the gooseberries are completely cooled and candied, transfer them to an airtight container for storage.

## Cooking time
Approximately 20 minutes for boiling the syrup, plus cooling time for the gooseberries.
