# Boiled Pike

## Description
Boiled Pike is a classic dish that features a whole pike fish cooked in a flavorful broth. The fish is split and scored to allow for even cooking and is seasoned with salt. It is then grilled until crispy and served with a tangy butter sauce and garnished with citrus slices and rosemary.

## Options and commentary
- You can use any whole fish of similar size and texture if pike is not available.
- If you prefer a milder flavor, you can omit the rosemary.
- Lemon juice or white wine vinegar can be used interchangeably for the tangy sauce.

## Ingredients:
- 1 whole pike (or any similar whole fish)
- Salt
- Butter
- Juice of lemons or white wine vinegar
- Slices of oranges or lemons (for garnish)
- Slices of rosemary (for garnish)

## Instructions:
1. Split the pike along its belly using a sharp knife. Score the flesh on the outside of the fish with shallow diagonal cuts.
2. Season the fish generously with salt, making sure to rub it into the scored flesh.
3. Preheat a grill or stovetop grill pan over medium-high heat until very hot.
4. Place the pike on the grill and baste it with melted butter. Turn the fish frequently to ensure even cooking and to prevent it from sticking to the grill.
5. Grill the pike until it is stiff and crispy, with a golden-brown color on the outside. This will take approximately 10-15 minutes, depending on the size of the fish.
6. Remove the pike from the grill and transfer it to a serving dish.
7. In a small saucepan, melt some butter and add the juice of lemons or white wine vinegar. Heat the mixture gently until it is warm.
8. Pour the warm butter sauce over the grilled pike.
9. Garnish the dish with slices of oranges or lemons and slices of rosemary.
10. Serve the boiled pike immediately.

## Cooking time
Approximately 10-15 minutes, depending on the size of the fish.
