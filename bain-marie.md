# Bain-Marie

## Description
Bain-Marie is a traditional French dish made with a combination of lean beef, veal fillet, mutton, capon, and partridge. The meats are cooked in a scalded pan with water, seasoned with salt and onion, and covered with a lid and pastry to create a steamy environment. The resulting broth is strained and simmered with bread crusts before serving.
