# Dum

## Description
Dum is a traditional 18th-century alcoholic beverage made from malt, beans, oatmeal, and various herbs and spices. It is a fermented drink that takes approximately two years to mature.

## Options and commentary
- The original recipe calls for the use of the inner rind of fir, tops of fir and birch, avens, betony, burnet, marjoram, mother of thyme, penny-royal, elderflowers, Rosa Solis, Carduus Benedictus, barberries, and cardamoms. However, modern alternatives can include cardamoms, saffron, ginger, walnut-tree rind, elecampane root, red sanders, Alexander watercresses, brooklime, and horseradish root.
- The use of eggs in the recipe is optional and can be omitted if desired.
