# Beef Steaks Rolled

## Description
This recipe involves rolling large beef steaks with a flavorful stuffing made from capon, veal, bacon, sweetbreads, onions, parsley, mushrooms, truffles, eggs, and cream. The rolled steaks are then stewed until tender and served with a ragout or a rich sauce.

## Ingredients:
- 3-4 large beef steaks
- 1 capon, flesh only
- 200g fillet of veal
- 100g gammon of bacon, fat and lean
- 100g fat of veal loin
- 2 sweetbreads
- 2 young onions
- A handful of parsley
- A handful of mushrooms
- A handful of truffles
- 4 egg yolks
- 50ml cream
- Spice and herbs (such as salt, pepper, thyme, and rosemary)
- Ragout or sauce for serving

## Instructions:
1. Flatten the beef steaks using a meat cleaver or a meat mallet.
2. In a food processor, combine the capon flesh, fillet of veal, bacon, fat of veal loin, sweetbreads, young onions, parsley, mushrooms, truffles, egg yolks, and cream. Process until well combined and the mixture forms a smooth paste.
3. Season the farce mixture with salt, pepper, thyme, rosemary, and any other desired spices and herbs. Adjust the seasoning according to taste.
4. Spread the farce mixture evenly over the flattened beef steaks.
5. Roll up the beef steaks tightly, ensuring that the stuffing is enclosed within the rolls. Secure the rolls with kitchen twine or toothpicks, if necessary.
6. Heat a large skillet or Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Add a small amount of oil or butter to the pan.
7. Brown the beef steak rolls on all sides until they develop a golden crust.
8. Reduce the heat to low and add enough water or beef broth to partially cover the beef rolls.
9. Cover the skillet or Dutch oven and let the beef rolls simmer gently for about 2-3 hours, or until the meat is tender and the flavors have melded together.
10. Once the beef rolls are cooked, carefully remove them from the cooking liquid and allow them to rest for a few minutes.
11. Slice the beef rolls in half lengthwise and arrange them in a serving dish with the cut sides facing up.
12. Serve the beef rolls with a ragout or a rich sauce of your choice.
