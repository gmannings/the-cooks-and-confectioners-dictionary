# Fried Sole with White Sauce and Mushroom Ragout

## Description
This recipe is a modernized version of a dish from an 18th-century cookbook. It features fried sole fillets served with a white sauce and a mushroom ragout. The dish is flavorful and can be served as a main course for a special dinner.

## Options and commentary
- Instead of sole, you can use other white fish fillets such as cod or haddock.
- The white sauce can be made with either an anchovy and capers or a Robert sauce. Alternatively, you can make a mushroom ragout with pike livers, chopped artichoke bottoms, and carp roe.
- The dish is best served with a squeeze of lemon juice for added freshness.

## Ingredients:
- 4 sole fillets
- Flour, for dredging
- Clarified butter, for frying
- Flesh of other sole fillets, for garnish
- For the white sauce:
  - 1 anchovy fillet, finely chopped
  - 1 tablespoon capers, drained and chopped
  - or
  - 1/4 cup Robert sauce
- For the mushroom ragout:
  - 1 cup mushrooms, sliced
  - 1/4 cup pike livers, finely chopped
  - 1/4 cup artichoke bottoms, chopped very small
  - 1/4 cup carp roe
- Juice of 1 lemon

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 200°C (400°F).
2. Open the sole fillets on the back and both sides, and remove the bones until the whole flesh appears.
3. Dredge the sole fillets with flour, shaking off any excess.
4. Heat a large skillet over medium heat and add enough clarified butter to coat the bottom of the skillet.
5. Fry the sole fillets in the skillet until golden brown on both sides, about 2-3 minutes per side. Remove from the skillet and place on a baking sheet.
6. Garnish the fried sole fillets with the flesh of other sole fillets.
7. In a small saucepan, prepare the white sauce by combining the anchovy fillet (or capers) with the Robert sauce. Heat over low heat until warmed through.
8. In another skillet, prepare the mushroom ragout by sautéing the mushrooms, pike livers, and artichoke bottoms until cooked through and slightly browned. Stir in the carp roe and cook for an additional minute.
9. Squeeze the juice of a lemon over the mushroom ragout and stir to combine.
10. Place the baking sheet with the fried sole fillets in the preheated oven for 5 minutes to ensure they are fully cooked.
11. To serve, place a fried sole fillet on a plate, spoon some white sauce over it, and top with a spoonful of mushroom ragout. Repeat with the remaining fillets.
12. Serve the dish immediately, garnished with fresh herbs if desired.
